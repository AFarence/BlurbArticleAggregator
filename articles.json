        "subhead": "The mayor\u2019s enthusiasm for the White Stadium project stands in sharp contrast to seven years ago, when she blocked a plan for a New England Revolution stadium as a city councilor",
        "content": "It wasn\u2019t that long ago that one of the most powerful members of the Boston City Council raised all sorts of questions about whether the city was moving too quickly to sell city land to a private developer for a professional soccer stadium.The councilor? Michelle Wu, who in 2018 stood in the way of then-Mayor Marty Walsh\u2019s plan to help Robert Kraft build a soccer stadium for his New England Revolution. Walsh wanted to issue a request for proposals, or an RFP, to sell an 18-acre city-owned tow lot in South Boston off the Southeast Expressway, as a way to give Kraft an opportunity at a site for a long-planned Revs stadium.But Walsh had to get his plan past Wu, who at the time chaired a council committee that had to declare the lot surplus property before it could be sold. And she wasn\u2019t going to just greenlight it.\u201cRather than just take a vote and move on, we should hear more from the public and gather more [information],\u201d Wu told the Globe at the time. \u201cPublic land should be used for the greatest public good. We haven\u2019t seen any analysis yet of what the greatest good would be.\u201dAdvertisementMy my, how the tables have turned.The lot never went up for sale \u2014 it\u2019s still where you go when your car gets towed from downtown \u2014 and Kraft moved on, setting his sights on building a stadium in Everett. But the more things change, the more they stay the same.Wu\u2019s now the mayor, trying to help a new professional women\u2019s soccer team turn White Stadium in Franklin Park into a gleaming new home. And now she, too, is getting in hot water over the city\u2019s RFP process.The White Stadium arrangement is different than the tow lot in that Wu is not selling the 10,000-seat facility to a private developer, but rather leasing it to Boston Unity Soccer Partners for 10 years. Under the deal, the city would continue to own the stadium, and the team would share it with Boston Public Schools. The city and team will split the cost of the renovation, which is expected to exceed $200 million.AdvertisementThe city tow lot south of downtown was once seen as a potential site for a stadium for the New England Revolution. But then-City Councilor Michelle Wu blocked a deal.David L. RyanWhite Stadium has been crumbling for decades, and many a mayor has tried to renovate it. The Wu administration contends that having a private partner is the only way the city can afford to fix it, and the deal struck with the team still gives the community and BPS full-day access to the stadium for all but 40 days of the year.But much as Wu did seven years ago, critics say the White Stadium plan is opaque, misguided, and being rammed through. The city, they say, needs to do more research on how best to renovate the stadium for BPS.This week we learned, as first reported in the Boston Herald, that Wu\u2019s City Hall has been in talks with Boston Unity Soccer Partners about White Stadium as early as September 2022. With the seed planted, the city issued an RFP in April 2023 for a lease of White Stadium in a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201dWe can all guess what happened next: The RFP went out, and Boston Unity Soccer Partners was the only group that submitted a proposal.Opponents of the White Stadium plan \u2014 some neighbors and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy \u2014 have seized on the Herald story, based on email exchanges between the team and city officials, as proof the team had an inside track on the stadium.Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft had choice words, too, calling the report evidence of a \u201csecretive and rigged RFP process.\u201dWu has vigorously disputed that characterization, calling it \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s nothing untoward about potential bidders having conversations with the city before an RFP is filed, and it\u2019s conceivable that the RFP generated only a single response.Advertisement(Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has had a minority interest in the women\u2019s soccer team, and last week she announced she is pulling out of the team\u2019s investor group.)As for what happened in 2018, Wu got on the phone on Thursday to say that she has been \u201ccompletely consistent\u201d on how there should be public discussions about how to use public land. She said the Walsh administration\u2019s proposal to sell the tow lot for a soccer stadium never went anywhere because no one was willing to publicly offer details at a hearing Wu chaired at the time.\u201cI was never opposed to a soccer stadium in Boston,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that we should try to bring that amenity and economic development opportunity and excitement to the city.\u201dWu went on to say that after becoming mayor she reached out to Robert Kraft about having the Revs stadium in Boston. She said she never heard back. (On Friday, a spokesperson for Robert Kraft said he never heard from the Wu administration.)The White Stadium deal reflects how she feels that public land should not be sold off, similar to how she felt as a councilor in 2018, and how public land as a general principle \u201cshould stay wherever possible, under the public trust, under public ownership, because that is how you have permanent control over what happens.\u201dStill, that hasn\u2019t placated opponents who have sued the city to halt the project, with the case set to go to trial on March 18. Demolition is well underway, and Wu said the construction schedule is on track. The women\u2019s team is planning to play in the renovated White Stadium by its inaugural season next spring.AdvertisementMeantime, it\u2019s a mayoral election year. Stadium opponents and supporters are worked up. And just as you thought the L\u2019Affaire White Stadium couldn\u2019t get any messier \u2014 it has.So, for Wu, perhaps we\u2019ll file this one under: Do as I say, not as I do.Shirley Leung is a Business columnist.

        "hed": "Middleborough sues Healey, state over MBTA housing law requirements",
        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The town of Middleborough sued Governor Maura Healey and the state housing office Friday, seeking an exemption from the controversial MBTA Communities Act, which requires cities and towns served by the T to make it easier to build multifamily housing within their borders.The lawsuit asks for a waiver from the law\u2019s zoning requirements under a recent opinion from State Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who called the law an \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d because, she said, the Legislature did not designate adequate funds for its implementation.Related: More controversy erupts after state auditor says Mass. housing law is an \u2018unfunded mandate\u2019Middleborough, the town said in the lawsuit, has already built housing near its commuter rail station in recent years, and should not be forced to make room for more. Adhering to the law\u2019s requirements would be a \u201csignificant expense\u201d because the town does not have the infrastructure to accommodate more development, it said. Lawyers for the town added that the state has gone too far in punishing towns it deems noncompliant, carrying out a \u201ccampaign of threats, intimidation, and coercion.\u201dMiddleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law\u2019s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.AdvertisementThe town wrote to DiZoglio\u2019s office last year requesting her to weigh in on the law, and when Middleborough officials received her opinion last week calling it an unfunded mandate, they moved quickly to prepare a lawsuit.For the Healey administration, this is yet another roadblock for a law that it inherited from the Legislature but has become central to its housing strategy.The administration set a goal in February of building 222,000 new homes by 2035 in order to head off the housing shortage, which is quickly warping the economic reality of everyday residents. The state is well behind the pace of construction needed to meet that goal, and officials see MBTA Communities \u2014 Massachusetts\u2019 most consequential new housing law in decades \u2014 as key to course correcting. Most of the state\u2019s housing production over the last several decades has happened in Boston and a few neighboring communities. The law is designed to stimulate housing production in the suburbs and towns in Eastern Massachusetts that have long shut out new development.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysAdvertisementBut towns have not taken kindly to the law. Some see it as an affront on Massachusetts' tradition of local government decisions over land-use rules, and many do not want to encourage the production of more homes, particularly apartment buildings.The law requires 177 cities and towns with access to the T create zoning districts that allow for multifamily housing, but it does not mandate building.Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued the town of Milton last year for failing to meet the law\u2019s requirements, and the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law, though it also ruled that the state must put the guidelines that shape its implementation through a formal regulatory process.Campbell, in a statement Friday, said her office will defend the law.\u201cI am grateful to the majority of communities that understand the importance of responsible zoning, and my office and I intend to successfully defend this law in court,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Auditor\u2019s incorrect legal assessment has spurred challenges to a law meant to address our housing crisis.\u201dMiddleborough officials say the town created a multifamily zoning district in 2021 that has since yielded 174 multifamily units, a quarter of which are set at affordable rents. And over the last 20 years, the town has seen 881 housing units built within a mile of its commuter rail station.Related: How will the state\u2019s historic rezoning mandate affect your community?AdvertisementIt argues that should be enough to satisfy the requirements of MBTA Communities. But under the law, the town has to create zoning that makes room for at least 1,471 units. The zoning the town passed in 2021 only allows for 549 units.Lawyers for the town said it has been unfairly punished for not complying with the law\u2019s requirements \u201cthrough the withholding and/or recission of more than $6.5 million in funding for school programs, infrastructure projects, and other initiatives that are necessary to provide the very housing the Act was enacted to create.\u201d Those funding programs are discretionary, and the state has, in some cases, tied towns\u2019 chances of approval to their MBTA Communities compliance status.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new in Middleboro. We recognize the need for more housing near public transit as a function of responsible town planning,\u201d Middleborough Town Manager James McGrail said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our part. We are not anti-housing. The fact that we\u2019re even having to go to court to sort this out is crazy.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.",

        "content": "A team of Boston developers and Chicago investors have unveiled their designs for a pair of 18-story apartment towers on the site of the former WLVI television studio in Dorchester, the first phase of an already approved project that would bring five other buildings to that stretch of Morrissey Boulevard.Local development firm Copper Mill and an entity managed by Chicago-based investor POB Capital are proposing two towers with a combined 754 apartments near the JFK/UMass MBTA stop, next to the former headquarters of The Boston Globe, now a lab and office complex called Southline.The development team \u201cis committed to delivering a mixed-use program that serves the long-term interests of Savin Hill, Columbia Point and greater Dorchester neighborhoods,\u201d wrote Andrew Flynn, Copper Mill\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a December letter to the Boston Planning Department.AdvertisementA rendering of two 18-story residential towers proposed at 75 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester.CBTDesigned by Boston-based CBT Architects, the towers \u2014 one at 204 feet facing Morrissey Boulevard, another at 206 feet facing Interstate 93 \u2014 would each have three levels of underground parking. Between them, the developers have planned a roughly half-acre community park.The Morrissey Boulevard project stretches nearly 9 acres from 35-75 Morrissey Blvd., including the Star Market grocery store and former TV studio along with the former Beasley Media radio studios. A seven-building master plan, approved by the Boston Planning and Development Agency board in 2023 \u2014 albeit under a different developer \u2014 calls for three apartment buildings and four office/lab buildings.The BPDA board-approved master plan calls for a grocery store to be included within the third planned residential tower. The radio site at 55 Morrissey Blvd. now houses The Record Co., which offers affordable recording studio and rehearsal spaces.

        "content": "Massachusetts state officials have offered up a prime location in Woburn for development: the 26-acre Anderson Regional Transportation Center.The transportation hub, at 100 Atlantic Ave., is owned by a joint venture of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and is home to a station for the MBTA\u2019s Lowell commuter rail line, Amtrak\u2019s Downeaster line, and Massport\u2019s Logan Express shuttles. Any development would need to retain or enhance the various transit uses. However, because of a history of pollution there, residential and school uses are currently not allowed.The goal is to find a developer willing to take some or all of the 2,400 surface parking spaces and consolidate them in a multi-level garage, opening up land for development. For now, the transit agencies are seeking \u201cexpressions of interest\u201d from developers to better understand the site\u2019s potential and the market demand. Responses are due by April 30.Other development activities nearby include the rezoning of 53 acres east of the rail line, to allow for multifamily construction in compliance with the MBTA Communities Act, the start of construction of a 425-unit multifamily project northwest of the transit hub, and permits issued for a 250-unit multifamily project north of the hub and a mixed-use project just to the west of it.AdvertisementOne of the biggest challenges, though, will be dealing with the property\u2019s contamination and its legacy as a Superfund site (a federal designation that identifies highly polluted properties). Industrial operations at the property, part of what was once known as the Industri-Plex site, contaminated the nearby Aberjona River as well as adjacent wetlands and the Mystic Lakes over the course of more than a century, through the 1960s. The transit agencies, in developing the Anderson center more than 20 years ago, built 25 acres of parking and a subsurface \u201cgeotextile\u201d barrier to help contain the underground pollution.For a developer to proceed with residential construction, the transit agencies said, it would need to work with federal and state environmental regulators to reevaluate the residential restriction.The transit hub is named after Jimmy Anderson, a child who died at the age of 12 from leukemia and whose case was made famous in the book and the movie, \u201cA Civil Action,\u201d about groundwater pollution in Woburn.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

He dealt with learning disabilities and lingering effects of malnutrition from his earliest years, then went on to run track in high school and graduate from North Shore Community College.Montanino struggled with alcoholism in his college years \u2014 a problem that led him to living on the streets for nearly two years. He\u2019d bounce back and forth from the Constitution Beach Walk to Jeffries Point, to the library and the flower shop. Sometimes he did food app delivery on foot for $7 an order.\u201cThat was my homeless life, just going from one thing to another ... never really knowing where my next meal was coming from,\u201d he said.AdvertisementThese days, though, Montanino is calling Jamaica Plain home. He\u2019s one of the new residents at 3368 Washington St., a five-story, $105 million residential building celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. Developed by Boston-based The Community Builders and homeless services provider Pine Street Inn, the building \u2014 to be named \u201cThe Lyndia\u201d in honor of Pine Street Inn executive director Lyndia Downie \u2014 is the largest permanent supportive housing development in New England. The 202-unit building includes 140 studios for formerly unhoused people referred by Pine Street in one wing, and 62 affordable units for families in another.The city of Boston provided some $17.3 million to the project, and supported it amid a lengthy lawsuit that challenged its zoning.Related: \u2018Permanent supportive housing\u2019 may be controversial to would-be neighbors, but it\u2019s been beneficial to those who live in it | Shirley Leung\u201cTo solve homelessness, you have to tackle the roots of the problem, which is making sure that people can have a home, and have support in living in their homes,\u201d said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \u201cYou really have to have a plan for homes to be accessible and supportive for everyone.\u201dDownie has long championed permanent supportive housing, which is basically an apartment with social services on site, and Pine Street has gradually grown its inventory of such buildings in recent years. Advocates say tackling the roots of homelessness requires more than just handing out grants, and instead making sure individuals have both a roof over their heads and access to health and wellness support systems to guide them through a world-upending transition. Montanino said he is frequently connected with security and outreach personnel, case managers, a personal landlord, and property managers, all of whom helped him move \u2014 and stay \u2014 off the streets.Advertisement\u201cThey\u2019re all hands on deck here,\u201d he said.Michael Montanino in his new unit at 3368 Washington St.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe 3368 Washington project includes support services like onsite mental health counseling, 24/7 security, and key fob-activated elevators. Residents are directly referred by Pine Street Inn. On a recent tour of the building, fliers for workforce development programs with Pine Street and Roxbury Community College were available for anyone to read.The property was formerly a low-slung warehouse, which Pine Street bought in 1997 and over the years used for a variety of functions, including office space for case workers and a small woodworking program. As Pine Street ramped up its housing development efforts, the site stood out, particularly given its proximity to the Green Street Orange Line station. Most developers responded to Pine Street\u2019s bid for proposals with pitches for around 40 to 60 units, Downie said. But Bart Mitchell, CEO of The Community Builders, aimed higher.\u201cBart and I went over to look at the site, and Bart, even that day, said, \u2018Look, if we can get some height relief, we can do something really sustainable here. We can get some scale,\u2019\u201d Downie said. \u201cThat was what, for us, was so exciting. ... The more long-term people you can move out, the better chance you have of meeting shelter demand.\u201dThe project hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. The landlord of a neighboring property sued in 2020, alleging the zoning process to allow the project was flawed. Though the lawsuit eventually settled, the delay cost \u201cmultiple millions\u201d of dollars, said Andy Waxman, Community Builders\u2019 senior vice president of real estate.AdvertisementPine Street and The Community Builders are collaborating on similar projects, including 900 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester, which is under construction now.

And so it takes people some time to learn that.\u201dPotential residents apply through the Boston Housing Authority, and then are screened by Pine Street. Folks have moved in gradually over the past few months, Downie said, and the building is expected to be full by June.With a gentle demeanor and a quick smile, Montanino proudly showed off his new home last week. He\u2019s learning to cook, and there are spices and oil next to his stove \u2014 he\u2019s done steaks and chicken, burgers, and salads. He\u2019s volunteering, and has lined up a job \u2014 he starts in April.

        "content": "When Fortis Property Group announced a $1 billion refinancing of One Lincoln St. in 2022, the developers championed the deal as a milestone for downtown Boston\u2019s revitalization.Fortis had landed a deal to lease 11 floors of the 36-story office building to private equity company HarbourVest and promised a heap of amenities \u2014 rooftop tennis and basketball courts, an artisanal market, and biergarten \u2014 to draw more tenants to fill the rest of the half-empty tower. Those plans attracted sophisticated investors, including San Francisco-based DivcoWest and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, according to a real estate industry source with knowledge of the deal.\u201cThis is an important moment for our firm and all of our partners,\u201d said Joel Kestenbaum, president of Brooklyn-based Fortis, at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t be prouder to see this deal come to fruition after nearly a year in the making.\u201dNext week, the 503-foot tower will go up for auction \u2014 a move forced by one of Fortis\u2019s unpaid lenders.AdvertisementIt\u2019s a stunning turn of events for a building whose blue glass and gray granite facade has long been one of the most prominent points on Boston\u2019s skyline. For two decades, it was home to State Street Corp., until 2023, when the financial giant decamped for a new tower across town.One Lincoln never recovered, and today \u2014 despite HarbourVest\u2019s arrival \u2014 the building still stands about half empty. There are at least four big loans on the tower, and with little rent coming in, Fortis has struggled to pay down its substantial debt. Now lenders want the money back. In the auction process, a new owner will likely take over the building.The facade at One Lincoln St.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFortis did not respond to a request for comment.While it\u2019s not clear how much One Lincoln will fetch at auction, it\u2019s fair to expect a far lower sum than the $1 billion valuation it commanded in 2022. That\u2019s a reality facing many commercial real estate owners in Boston right now. Five years after COVID upended the city\u2019s office market, a long-delayed reckoning on the value of office towers is coming, with major implications on the city\u2019s tax base and the future of downtown.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s like the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s not a loss until you sell it,\u201d said Dion Sorrentino, associate director of market analytics at CoStar Group in Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hold it for as long as they can.\u201dFor a dozen years after the 2008 financial crisis, commercial real estate prices steadily rose in Boston, generating eye-popping sales numbers and fueling the city\u2019s budget. Rock-bottom interest rates made borrowing easy and cheap. Companies poured into downtown to tap the city\u2019s talented young workforce. By the end of 2019, office vacancy was in the single digits and investors spent more than $8 billion that year alone to snap up commercial real estate that, by all accounts, was going to remain valuable for years to come.Then came the pandemic. Demand for office space plummeted, and today the vacancy rate is 21.1 percent, according to real estate firm Newmark. Meanwhile interest rates skyrocketed. That made it more expensive to borrow money for development projects and to refinance existing debt, particularly loans made at low, pre-COVID, interest rates.A developer has proposed converting 400 Atlantic Ave., a low-lying brick office facing Boston Harbor, into a hotel.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffDowntown landlords could hang on, for a time.While there are abundant smaller owners, many premier buildings in Boston are owned \u2014 in full or in part \u2014 by large real estate firms such as Boston Properties and Tishman Speyer; private equity like Rockpoint Group; or investment arms of pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, such as Oxford Properties and Norges Bank. Their deep pockets bought them time, and lenders offered extensions on repayments for a year or two, said Mark Fallon, director of research and strategy at real estate brokerage Hunneman in Boston.AdvertisementFor years, that \u201cextend and pretend\u201d phenomenon kept Boston\u2019s commercial real estate sales market in relative stasis. Meanwhile owners fished for lucrative new leases to pay down their debt. The prospect of converting office to lab space \u2014 expensive, but with the potential to draw in high-paying life-science companies as tenants \u2014 continued to generate hope for a turnaround.But mostly, local owners have held off on selling for a simple reason, said Jeffrey Havsy of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no forcing mechanism, if the debt wasn\u2019t due.\u201dNow though, those bills are coming due, prompting new momentum in the sales market. For many, the decision to sell will be difficult and costly: Havsy said many downtown buildings could sell for 40 to 60 percent of their pre-COVID price.The trend is one that city officials and financial watchdogs are monitoring closely. Some 71.1 percent of Boston\u2019s $4.6 billion budget is funded by property taxes \u2014 much of it on commercial property \u2014 and price declines could hit that revenue hard. But the change could also lower rents, potentially broadening the number of tenants who can afford space downtown.Related: Corporate signs are proliferating on Boston's skylineA price reset, Havsy said, can also loosen up opportunities for investors with cash and patience, like Norges Bank. In December, an arm of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund paid $248 per square foot for just over half of 33 Arch St., according to research from real estate firm Avison Young. That\u2019s less than half the $606 per square foot that retirement behemoth TIAA paid to buy the 33-story downtown tower in 2011. (Norges bought out the first half of TIAA\u2019s stake in 2013.)Advertisement\u201cIn a period of heightened dislocation in the office sector, we see this as an opportune moment to invest,\u201d said Norges real estate executive Per L\u00f8ken in a statement. Along with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Norges also bought just over half of 501 Boylston St. in Back Bay \u2014 noting its $194.9 million in existing debt \u2014 giving it full control of the building after it bought the first half in 2018.TIAA did not respond to a Globe request for comment.That kind of real estate calculus \u2014 or perhaps musical chairs \u2014 can get tricky fast, leaving a fair amount of uncertainty as to what buildings are actually worth. In the past five years, it\u2019s been tough to discern the pandemic\u2019s impact on office values, and, in turn, municipal tax revenues \u2014 in large part because many owners haven\u2019t had to sell.\u201cWhat is happening now is a reset,\u201d said Jason S. Weissman, founder of Boston Realty Advisors. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing it all over.\u201dMany of the city\u2019s largest taxpayers are commercial landlords. One Lincoln, the tower up for auction in March, owes more than $15 million in net tax to the city this fiscal year. The 32-story office tower at 99 High St., which went up for sale in July, owes $8.6 million in net taxes. The value of those buildings has an outsize impact on city finances, one reason Mayor Michelle Wu last year sought to hike commercial tax rates to keep revenue flowing. That effort stalled in the state Senate, but she is trying again this year.The 32-story office tower at 99 High St. was listed for sale in July 2024.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in downtown property values could represent a mammoth hit to city finances. The Boston Municipal Research Bureau, an independent financial watchdog organization, in November explored how the city could diversify its revenue sources to not be so heavily dependent on property taxes.AdvertisementOf course, not all buildings are selling for a loss. An entity of Qatari investor Ezdan Holding Group paid $99.5 million for the 11-story office at 855 Boylston St. in Back Bay in fall 2023 \u2014 more than double what the property sold for in 2000. And, generally speaking, newer and higher-end buildings have maintained stronger demand from tenants willing to pay top-tier rents.But for buildings with low occupancy, it\u2019s difficult to restructure debt, said Aaron Jodka, the director of US capital markets research for Colliers. That\u2019s opening up avenues for buyers \u2014 family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other private investors \u2014 who are seeing \u201ca generational acquisition opportunity,\u201d Jodka said, and sometimes a chance to try something other than office space.One example: JAJ Investment Group, the Luxembourg-based family office of French financier Jacques Chahine, plans to convert 400 Atlantic Ave. \u2014 a low-lying former law office facing Boston Harbor \u2014 into a hotel. The office was formerly the longtime home of Goulston & Storrs, which moved to nearby One Post Office Square last April.\u201cWhen there is upheaval and change in the market, it does create new opportunities for others,\u201d Jodka said. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s usually the pain the previous owner has to go through.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "On the day he launched his mayoral campaign, Josh Kraft went on the offensive, assailing Mayor Michelle Wu over her record on bike lanes and housing construction. That was no surprise.But one avenue of attack raised eyebrows across the city. Kraft said he would make good on a progressive policy promise that Wu had tried but failed: Bringing rent control back to Boston.\u201cMayor Wu promised us rent control three years ago,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cWe will deliver it finally.\u201dThat Kraft, the son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft and a favored candidate in some corners of the business community, would lean into an issue that many economists believe does more harm than good and most landlords despise, signals just how big a problem the cost of housing has become for everyday Bostonians. Yet the specifics of his proposal suggest he\u2019s trying to walk a fine political line to appeal to two very different political constituencies that rarely see eye to eye: the business community and tenants.While Kraft calls his proposal rent control, housing experts and political observers said it is not really rent control in the traditional sense of the hard rent caps seen in New York City, San Francisco, and Boston before state voters outlawed them here in 1994. It is instead an optional program for landlords who would receive tax breaks if they agree to cap annual rent increases. While it could be appealing for property owners to participate, it is not mandatory. And critics argue Kraft\u2019s plan may simply provide some landlords with tax breaks, while doing little to protect struggling renters.Related: Josh Kraft\u2019s tax break for \u2018good landlords\u2019 already exists, and the Boston City Council just voted for itAdvertisementBut his embrace of a term once considered politically untenable appears to be a calculated move. The idea of rent control has become increasingly popular in some corners of the city as rents climb relentlessly upward. And these days, political observers say, winning an election in Boston requires a whatever-it-takes approach to housing affordability.\u201c[Kraft\u2019s proposal] is not rent control, but the fact that he\u2019s proposing it shows how significant an issue housing has become for the city,\u201d said Josh Zakim, a former city councilor who served alongside Wu and who now runs a housing advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest issue facing the city and the Commonwealth, and I don\u2019t think you can run a serious campaign for public office here without a plan to address it.\u201dAdvertisementKraft\u2019s plan takes considerable cues from the version of rent control that Wu tried unsuccessfully to push through the state Legislature in 2023. Like Wu\u2019s plan, it would tie allowable rent hikes to inflation, with a hard cap of 10 percent per year. While Wu\u2019s set no income guidelines, Kraft\u2019s plan would be open to tenants who make less than 200 percent of the Area Median Income, more than $300,000 for a family of four, which he said would prevent luxury buildings from participating.Mayor Michelle Wu looked on as the City Council voted to approve her proposal to restore rent control in Boston in 2023. The measure later died on Beacon Hill.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe biggest differences are that Kraft\u2019s program would be optional for landlords, and would come with a sweetener: property tax breaks of 20 percent for participating buildings. Kraft said he\u2019d pay for that with tax revenue generated by new residential construction, which he hopes to spark by lowering affordable housing requirements.The city requires 20 percent of units in new developments to be set aside at affordable rents. Kraft wants to lower it to 13 percent, the rule that was in place before Wu took office.Kraft\u2019s campaign said that because the money would be distributed to landlords in the form of grants, as opposed to formal tax rebates, his plan would not need to go through the state Legislature (though that point is disputed by some advocates and legislators).\u201cJosh\u2019s opt-in rent control plan would provide real relief to renters, unlike Mayor Wu\u2019s failed plan that has helped no one,\u201d the Kraft campaign said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another unfulfilled promise which Mayor Wu needs to explain to voters instead of calling names and making excuses.\u201dRelated: Who is Josh Kraft, the nonprofit leader and son of the Patriots owner challenging Michelle Wu for mayor?AdvertisementFor her part, Wu assailed Kraft\u2019s plan, calling it \u201cfake rent control.\u201d She said he is using the promise of rent control to win over struggling renters who are hurting, while offering them no real protections.\u201cThis program, a voluntary program, is not going to \u2026 protect against the worst offenders [of extreme rent hikes],\u201d Wu said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio last week. \u201cIt is a use of resources without offering the types of protections that we really need.\u201dWu has not reintroduced her rent control plan since it died in the Legislature last year.So far, no prominent tenant groups have come out in support of Kraft\u2019s plan, but it\u2019s getting a positive reception among some real estate interests, who lobbied against Wu\u2019s plan and ultimately helped sink it on Beacon Hill.Developers and landlords generally oppose mandatory rent caps because they limit a building\u2019s profitability, making it more difficult to attract the investors needed to build and therefore slowing new construction. They\u2019re also a political constituency that appears at least intrigued by \u2014 if not yet openly supportive of \u2014 Kraft\u2019s candidacy.\u201cWe have long been opposed to rent control because we have seen the impact it has on housing production,\u201d said Tamara Small, chief executive of real estate trade group NAIOP Massachusetts, which does not endorse political candidates. \u201cWhen the investors that finance housing development hear the words rent control, they flee. But this proposal is clearly different. I don\u2019t think it would hurt production the way [Wu\u2019s] proposal would.\u201dAdvertisementAn apartment building under construction in Jamaica Plain last year. New construction has slowed in Boston amid higher interest rates and materials costs. Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft has said he'd lower affordable housing requirements to help boost new projects.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffWhile it\u2019s unclear how many landlords may opt in to such a program, some have already indicated they may be interested. In some cases, the program may actually be profitable for landlords, as they\u2019d get tax breaks even in years when they wouldn\u2019t normally raise the rent above the proposed cap.Take Chris Lehman, cofounder of real estate investment group Groma. His group typically raises rent by an average of 3 to 5 percent a year across its more than 300-unit portfolio, well below the cap Kraft proposes. He conducted a financial feasibility analysis of Kraft\u2019s plan at the request of his campaign, and found that savings on taxes would make up for lost rent. He said he would consider enrolling the majority of his units.Related: Lessons in modern-day rent control, 3,000 miles from Boston\u201cIf there were an actual rent control, we would of course oppose it,\u201d he said. \u201dBut this program could mean lower rent increases for our residents without hurting development.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether Kraft\u2019s rent moderation policy will be enough to win over housing advocates and tenants who have historically come out in force for Wu and who have often demanded stronger affordability requirements in new development. At least one group of advocates, the Coalition for a Truly Affordable Boston, is more focused on his plan to cut affordability, which they called a \u201cdirect attack on Boston\u2019s affordability and housing justice efforts.\u201d\u201cIncreasing housing supply alone does not guarantee affordability \u2014 especially when developers are not required to build homes that meet the needs of our residents,\u201d said Shameeka Moreno, a member of the Boston Tenant Coalition.AdvertisementAnd lawmakers who\u2019ve long worked on housing issues say they\u2019re skeptical that Kraft\u2019s plan would generate enough affordable units to cancel out the ones lost by lowering affordable housing requirements, or do much to control Boston\u2019s soaring rents at all.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the words he\u2019s using \u2014 it\u2019s not rent control,\u201d said State Senator Lydia Edwards, a Wu ally and former city councilor from East Boston. \u201cI welcome creative policy solutions and that this is a major issue in the mayor\u2019s race. But this feels like he\u2019s using the term rent control in order to try to get some attention and some headlines.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "The stately brick homes on Beacon Hill aren\u2019t the only real estate that\u2019s selling for a premium fee.A single parking spot in a garage on Brimmer Street is on the market for $750,000, according to a real estate listing posted last week. It\u2019s just the latest spot to notch a steep price tag in the neighborhood, where it seems the only thing more coveted than housing is parking.\u201cIt\u2019s a great long-term hold,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, a realtor for Cabot & Company and one of the spot\u2019s two listing agents. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be building any more parking on the hill.\u201dThe parking space, first reported on by the Boston Herald, is located in a luxury garage just off Storrow Drive that offers refueling, car washing, and other concierge services, according to the listing.AdvertisementRodriguez said the spot belongs to a family that recently closed a deal to sell their home in the neighborhood. Some potential buyers have shown interest in the space, but it was still \u201cvery much available\u201d as of Thursday, he added.Brimmer Street Garage, which bills itself as Beacon Hill\u2019s \u201cmost exclusive venue to capture a parking space,\u201d operates as a condominium; the spots are sold privately as deeded, taxable pieces of property.When homes are sold on Beacon Hill, the sellers usually include the value of their parking spaces in the overall sale price. Oftentimes, the deeds to the spaces are transferred by a symbolic payment, Rodriguez said.\u201cWhen [sellers] go to record the sale of the house, they also record the sale of the parking because it\u2019s a fully separate deed, and they\u2019ll just record it as $1,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we actually don\u2019t know what the true value was ... for that parking space.\u201dBut when parking spaces come on the market separately, they can fetch well over half a million dollars.\u201cThe owners of this space thought it made more sense to bring it to market and see what the market would bear,\u201d Rodriguez said.In 1979, single parking spaces at the Brimmer were being sold for $7,500, or roughly $35,000 in today\u2019s money, according to the garage\u2019s website.AdvertisementLast year, the most expensive parking spot in the garage sold for $565,000, Rodriguez said.It\u2019s rare for a parking space at a \u201cfull service\u201d garage like the Brimmer to come on the market, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re spending $5 million, $10 million, $20 million for a house on the Hill and you don\u2019t have any parking \u2014 at that point, for purchasing a spot, it becomes splitting hairs whether you pay $500,000 or $600,[000] or $700,000,\u201d he said.Camilo Fonseca can be reached at camilo.fonseca@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Apartment buildings need a lot of wood. And around here, wood mostly comes from Canada.",
        "content": "There are two main ingredients in cost of building housing: labor and materials. Here in New England especially \u2014 where builders have long wrestled with the cost of construction \u2014 the 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports instituted this week by President Trump will make the latter even more expensive.Much of the softwood lumber and mass timber that goes into apartment buildings in Massachusetts comes from Canada, as does fabricated steel and aluminum. While costs vary, it\u2019s typical for materials to make up between 40 and 50 percent of a construction budget \u2014 with anywhere from 6 to 12 percent of that coming from imported goods, said Mike Kearns, chief operating officer of the New England region for construction management firm Shawmut Design and Construction in Boston.New tariffs are likely to spark a domino effect on costs, he says. A 25 percent premium on Canadian lumber could prompt a run on domestic suppliers \u2014 a market that\u2019s already at maximum capacity, Kearns said \u2014 which will in turn likely bring those domestic prices up, and further extend an already stressed supply chain.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why it costs so much to build housing in Greater BostonAdvertisementBuilders are constantly on the hunt for ways to bring costs down, but the tariffs are likely to affect whether a project\u2019s economics work \u2014 and whether builders can build. Indeed, in the Northeast, lumber costs comprise typically 15 to 18 percent of the cost of building a new home.\u201cIt\u2019s always this balancing act,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cIf that value proposition isn\u2019t there, then that\u2019s when you could see something pause.\u201dKearns stressed, however, that the industry is \u201ca long way from seeing [tariffs] shut down work,\u201d and that there are ways to navigate costs.Still, any adjustment in the existing tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber results in almost universal groans among wood suppliers who watch the changes closely, said Paul Rogers, purchasing manager at Shepley Wood Products, a supplier with offices in Hyannis, Nantucket, and Wellfleet. If the price of Canadian lumber effectively goes up 25 percent, the price charged by American mills in turn \u201cgoes up in sympathy,\u201d Rogers said.\u201cEverybody follows the numbers,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what side of the border it\u2019s coming from.\u201dAdvertisementThe margin on lumber is already slim \u2014 \u201cin the single digits,\u201d Rogers said \u2014 and tariffs further limit a lumber supplier\u2019s ability to negotiate pricing. Canadian softwood lumber like spruce, pine, and fir have carried tariffs since 1980, said Shepley president Tony Shepley. Now those will go up even higher.An apartment building under construction in Everett in 2023.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFor development projects in the Northeast, architects will often specify that they want Canadian softwood lumber \u2014 both for how it\u2019s grown and how it survives in the Northeastern climate, said Rita Ferris, president of the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association, which represents independent lumber and building material suppliers from Maine to Washington, D.C.There\u2019s huge concern about tariffs further slowing development of residential housing, which has already faced huge cost pressures, Ferris said.\u201cWe just don\u2019t grow enough of our own to meet our own demands,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cWe totally get the goal of putting America first and having American workers and all of that. But if you can\u2019t supply yourself, it\u2019s really an extra burden.\u201dTariffs are of course nothing new to the construction industry. Prior presidential administrations have instituted tariffs on materials including steel and lumber, boosting their overall price, wrote Paul Brussow, president of Rider Levett Bucknall North America, in the firm\u2019s recent quarterly construction cost report. That report saw typical costs in Boston climb 5.4 percent over the last year, second only to Chicago among major markets.\u201cWhile tariffs have had an impact, it was nothing compared to what inflation has done in recent years,\u201d Brussow wrote in January. \u201cWhen coupled with inflation and labor shortages, this trifecta, in the last few years, has strained supply chains, raised construction costs, and affected project timelines.\u201dRelated: A 10,000-unit housing development at Suffolk Downs is on hold indefinitely. Here\u2019s why.AdvertisementAdditional tariffs \u201care more likely to exacerbate these challenges, particularly for metals, plastics, and essential construction materials, potentially adding thousands to the cost of residential and commercial projects,\u201d Brussow wrote.For Riverdale Mills, a Northbridge company that makes steel wire mesh used in products like fences and lobster traps, the new tariffs are a one-two punch of bad news. Riverdale buys much of its steel from Canada \u2014 and an additional 25 percent tariff on steel will kick in on March 12. So by mid-month, the company will be paying 50 percent more for its most important raw material.The company\u2019s chief executive, James Knott Jr., said Riverdale can\u2019t avoid the tariffs by buying American steel, because US steelmakers used the tariffs as an excuse to jack up their own prices. They didn\u2019t even wait for the tariffs to begin.\u201cBack in February, the domestic guys all raised their prices in advance of those tariffs,\u201d Knott said.Knott has no intention of switching to a US source.\u201cRather than buy from a domestic supplier, I\u2019m going to buy from my reliable supplier in Canada,\u201d said Knott, \u201cbecause all the prices are equal.\u201dIronically, Knott said that most of the US suppliers are foreign-owned, but his Canadian supplier is owned by a US firm.The tariffs will harm him in another way, said Knott. About 35 to 45 percent of Riverdale\u2019s products are exported. But since the tariffs have boosted his production costs, his exported steel mesh will be too expensive to compete on world markets.Meanwhile Shepley of Shepley Wood Products said he would hope for \u201ccommon sense and cooler heads\u201d to prevail.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s our mission as an industry to protect consumers, to not let housing get driven further out of reach, and to get things settled down,\u201d Shepley said. \u201cSo this was a bit of a shock to the system, but we\u2019ll hope that everybody pulls themselves together and gets this going.\u201dSteel and lumber, two major components in housing construction, both face substantial price increases amid 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada.David L.

Rockpoint and Wells Fargo both declined to comment, while a representative for Newmark did not respond.The complex spans about 853,000 square feet and is about 71 percent occupied, according to data from real estate firm CoStar Group.Related: One of Boston\u2019s skyline-defining towers is on the auction block \u2014 and expected to sell at a big discountThe pending sale comes amid a broad price reset for Boston\u2019s office market, with a growing roster of towers going up for sale for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shook up demand for office space. Real estate experts expect downtown properties could be worth between 40 percent and 60 percent less than they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and several recent sales bear out that thesis.Rockpoint Group has owned 75-101 Federal, at least in part, since 2015, when it purchased the conjoined offices for $326.5 million. Rockpoint sold a 50 percent stake in the buildings to Carr Properties in March 2020 \u2014 the very same week COVID was declared a national emergency \u2014 for about $185 more per square foot than it had paid five years previously. (Carr sold its stake back to Rockpoint last year for an undisclosed price). Also that week, Rockpoint and Carr finalized a $292 million mortgage with Wells Fargo, according to Suffolk County records, a mortgage with a maturity date of March 12, 2025.AdvertisementThe 75-101 Federal St. buildings have entrances on both Federal and Devonshire streets in downtown Boston. Here, one of the towers is reflected in the facade of 100 Federal St. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe brick and stone 75 Federal St. building dates to 1929 and was once described by the Boston Landmarks Commission as \u201cthe most elaborately decorative Art Deco skyscraper standing in Boston.\u201d The 31-story tower at 101 Federal St. was built as an adjoining office in 1988. The towers are connected by a block-long lobby linking their two entrances \u2014 one on Federal Street, the other on Devonshire Street \u2014 that was renovated in 2016.AdvertisementTwo real estate industry sources said Rockpoint and Wells Fargo are working closely on the sale and collectively decided to bring Newmark\u2019s capital markets team in to market the property. The 262,000-square-foot 75 Federal St. is 78 percent occupied, while the 591,000-square-foot 101 Federal St. is 64 percent occupied, according to CoStar.Related: Take a look at the first skyscraper proposed in downtown Boston since the pandemicIt\u2019s not clear for how much the towers could sell. Several recent deals have seen properties trade at big discounts, with significant implications for both the city\u2019s tax base and their owners\u2019 balance sheets.For example, after purchasing 179 Lincoln St. near South Station in January 2020 for $155.7 million, a Blackstone entity sold the five-story building to Boston\u2019s Synergy Investments last March for $76.5 million \u2014 a 51 percent price decline, according to research from Avison Young. Also last March, Synergy purchased 101 Arch St. in Downtown Crossing for $78 million \u2014 some 36 percent less than it sold for in 2005, and some $11 million less than the property had sold for in 2002.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "Developers working with the Boston Housing Authority have obtained $70 million in backing for the first phase of a long-planned redevelopment of South Boston\u2019s Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex, one of the oldest public housing projects in America.WinnCompanies and the BHA on Thursday said the financing would allow construction of a 112,000-square-foot building with 94 new apartments designated for low-income families who already live at the complex. Under a plan approved in 2023, Winn and the authority plan to raise /$2 billion over the next two decades to redevelop the entire 30-acre complex into a mixed-income, mixed-use property with 3,300 apartments, retail space, and a community center.The first phase, dubbed Building A, will also include a new Veterans Park with an accessible tot lot, bike lane, new trees, and reconfigured streets safer for pedestrians.Advertisement\u201cFor almost nine decades, Mary Ellen McCormack has been a cornerstone of Boston\u2019s commitment to affordable housing,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. \u201cToday, we take a major step forward in ensuring that this historic community remains a vibrant, inclusive home for generations to come.\u201dTenants have been involved in planning the entire project, according to Carol Sullivan, executive director of the Mary Ellen McCormack Task Force, a resident advocacy group. \u201cI am very proud of this partnership and cannot wait to see the smiles on the residents\u2019 faces when they move into their new, affordable homes,\u201d Sullivan said in a statement.An artist's rendering of the first building in the planned redevelopment of South Boston's Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex.The Architectural TeamWinnCompanies chief executive Gilbert Winn said the redevelopment project would be a model for similar projects across the country. \u201cThis first building jumpstarts an ambitious and inspired undertaking many years in the making that will ultimately give rise to a new mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood,\u201d Winn said in a statement.Ed Flynn, who represents the McCormack area on the City Council, said the redevelopment\u2019s new park and community center will offer improvements to benefit all South Boston residents. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to see it through to completion in 2026,\u201d Flynn said in an email.The project\u2019s financing, $62 million for the building and $8 million for infrastructure, came from a variety of sources including a construction loan from Bank of America, federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Energy Tax Credit equity from Bank of America, a tax-exempt bridge loan and tax-exempt first mortgage loan from MassHousing, and a subordinate loan from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund maintained by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing & Livable Communities.AdvertisementThe McCormack project, built during the Great Depression, currently includes 1,016 deeply subsidized apartments across 35 buildings.

        "content": "For the last six years, Annie Gordon has not gone a day without worrying about facing eviction or a huge rent increase.Now, she can relax.Developer Related Beal, with financial backing from the City of Boston, is buying the 347-unit Mattapan apartment complex where Gordon has lived for nearly 50 years and setting rents at affordable rates, putting an end to a lengthy saga that saw fixed-income tenants battle with a landlord that bought the property in 2018 and raised rents dramatically.\u201cThe feeling is overwhelming relief,\u201d said Gordon, who is 74. \u201cWhen I got the call with the news, I couldn\u2019t even believe it because we\u2019ve been fighting, trying to stay in our homes for so long. There\u2019s still a part of me that can\u2019t believe it. We fought so hard, and we actually won.\u201dAdvertisementSome tenants wept when they heard the news, Gordon said.\u201cThe toll this took on all of us,\u201d she said, \u201cwas huge.\u201dThe city is contributing more than $10 million to the purchase to guarantee affordable rents for all of the units, as well as protections against big rent increases, officials said at a press conference at Fairlawn Estates, as the property was known before it was purchased in 2018. Half of the units will be set at rents affordable to tenants making 60 percent of the area median income, or $78,360 for a household of two, and the other half will be set at 80 percent AMI. Related\u2019s deal with the city also caps annual rent increases at 2 percent a year.Related\u2019s affiliate, Related Affordable, would not say how much they are spending to purchase the 12-building property, but DSF Group paid $65 million to buy it in 2018.Boston\u2019s $10 million contribution is coming through its Acquisition Opportunity Program, which provides funding to community and housing groups to finance the purchase of market-rate housing to be maintained as permanently affordable. The groups behind the transactions can borrow against the city\u2019s contribution to obtain additional capital. In this case, the city said it was able to secure nine times its $10 million investment in private funds.At 347 units, Related\u2019s purchase of the Mattapan property is by far the largest such acquisition under the AOP. In 2022, the city helped finance the purchase of 36 small apartment buildings totaling 114 apartments in East Boston for affordable housing.Related: Leader of Mattapan tenant organization staves off eviction ... for nowAdvertisementThe program is part of a broader strategy by Mayor Michelle Wu that has seen the city pour hundreds of millions of pandemic recovery dollars into the construction and acquisition of affordable housing. By purchasing market-rate homes, the city can avoid the prohibitive costs it takes to build new affordable housing, while maintaining buildings in neighborhoods that are gentrifying rapidly.\u201cThe City of Boston is so proud to play a role in restoring Fairlawn as an affordable home, because for decades, these units were known that way: an affordable place to raise a family,\u201d Wu said Monday. \u201cOver the last few years especially, the rent here was hiked up ... and families were forced out of Fairlawn, out of Mattapan, and out of the city.\u201dNow, \u201cit\u2019s a new day,\u201d said city housing chief Sheila Dillon.Fairlawn was built in the 1960s off Mattapan\u2019s Bismarck Street, and it eventually became a community cornerstone because its cheap rents supported a community of longtime tenants, some of whom live on fixed incomes.Annie Gordon in her Mattapan apartment in June 2020.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffA few of those tenants spent years advocating for the addition of the Mattapan commuter rail stop, but when it was finally built, the apartment complex became attractive for prospective investors, Gordon said.That\u2019s when DSF bought the place. Rents immediately rose, in some cases, by hundreds of dollars. Many tenants couldn\u2019t afford the increases. Some left, but others stayed and fought, refusing to pay the increases and forming a tenant association with the help of tenant group City Life/Vida Urbana.Related: From 2022: In East Boston, a big move to keep renters in their homesAdvertisementLast year, DSF moved to evict Gordon, but a judge sided with her and let her stay.\u201cTenants have been traumatized by this,\u201d said Gabrielle Rene, the Mattapan community organizer for City Life. \u201cThis has been years of pain and struggle.\u201dThe saga at Fairlawn Estates highlights how vulnerable many residents of the city are to big rent increases, and why policy makers should prioritize protections for renters, said Gordon. People like Gordon would benefit directly from something like rent control, she said. And the city should also pass the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would require landlords to give tenants and housing groups the opportunity to purchase apartment buildings before they go up for sale on the private market, she said.Related\u2019s purchase is a rare victory for tenants in a city where apartment buildings change hands and rents soar frequently. Many of those sales have much different endings.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cI\u2019m grateful I get to stay in my home.\u201dResidents and advocates gave a round of applause during the announcement Monday.

Now a bead of sweat dribbles down the side of his forehead as he leads a trio of Northeastern University students in sweatpants back down four flights of creaking stairs and into a narrow basement.Roughly 10 minutes of searching and two calls to the building owner later, he finally discovers apartment 41A, at the bottom of an outdoor staircase that is hidden by a stand of bushes.Now, he can go to work.The current occupants of unit 41A sit awkwardly in their bedrooms as Macdonald leads the students around the basement apartment. The place smells vaguely of cat urine, and there is a network of pipes running across the ceiling that may, or may not, transport the building\u2019s sewage. Macdonald explains that if they want a three-bedroom for around $4,500, this is the most spacious option they\u2019ll find.Related: What\u2019s the rent where you live?

And after New York City outlawed tenant-paid broker fees last year, Boston and neighboring cities like Cambridge and Somerville constitute the only major urban center in the United States where renters are obligated to pay.Related: Renters hate to pay broker fees. Could this be the year those fees go away?That could soon change. Momentum is building for a law in Boston that would charge the fees to whoever hires the broker between the landlord and the renter, rather than allowing landlords to decide. Key legislators have signaled their support, and Governor Maura Healey has signed on.Some brokers have taken that recent push as an affront on their profession, and warn that the housing market cannot function without them. Their job, they say, is to find renters a good deal.Renters aren\u2019t so sure.\u201cWe\u2019re expected to pay this guy?\u201d one of the students remarked under his breath as Macdonald wandered through the Symphony building searching for apartment 41A.Macdonald has only been a broker for a few years, but he knows the business. He wears a navy suit bulky enough for a professional wrestler and oozes with the confidence of a 22-year-old, which he is. He crushes energy drinks instead of coffee, and the empty cans litter his car\u2019s floorboards. He fires off text messages at red lights, because, he says, \u201ctime is money.\u201d He hopes to parlay the money he makes leasing rentals into investment properties someday.Related: NYC is about to make landlords cover most brokers fees. Will Boston follow suit?Macdonald is the youngest broker at Jacob Realty on Newbury Street, one of a handful of brokerages run by Boston real estate mogul Demetrios Salpoglou. He lives with his parents in New Hampshire and starts his day around 7:30 a.m., after an hour\u2019s drive to work.AdvertisementOn a recent day, Macdonald settles into his desk near a drafty window overlooking Newbury Street. The room fills with chatter of brokers calling landlords and loudly drafting voice-to-text messages to prospective tenants. In a back room, there is a wall with thousands of keys to apartments Jacob helps rent.Thomas Macdonald sat at his desk in the Jacob Realty office on Newbury Street.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffMacdonald usually starts his days scanning Salpoglou\u2019s database of 215,000 rental units for apartments that are about to hit the market or that have lingered for awhile.This morning, he has spotted a couple of one-bedrooms in Allston that are about to hit the market, both renting for over $2,000 a month.\u201cCan you make the moving costs any easier?\u201d he asks the landlord on the phone, angling for a sweetener he can offer would-be tenants, like a break on the security deposit.The landlord says no.Real estate brokers have been around in Boston for as long as people have needed homes. Brokers say they serve an important purpose: helping people navigate the cutthroat housing market to find a home where they can build their lives. But they tend to work mostly on behalf of landlords in this housing market, where homes are in high demand. Those owners typically have enough leverage to push the broker fee off to their tenants.Sites like Zillow and Apartment List allow apartment-hunters to narrow down options, but in many cases, they can\u2019t tour a unit without interacting with a broker who has listed the place on a landlord\u2019s behalf.It can be a lucrative venture. Macdonald would not say how much he makes in a year, but its an eat-what-you-kill business. Most rental brokers\u2019 compensation consists entirely of fees they charge on apartment rentals, and it can vary widely from broker to broker. A successful broker can easily make six figures by leasing expensive apartments at an efficient clip. Others who lease just a few units a month make considerably less. There are thousands of brokers in Boston battling for the listings and leases of the city\u2019s more than 300,000 apartments. On Newbury Street alone, there are several dozen brokerages.Advertisement\u201cBrokers and leasing agents provide a valuable service, and we get compensated for those services,\u201d said Eric Shabshelowitz, vice president of the luxury real estate agency Cabot & Company. \u201cYears ago, it was landlords who paid the fee, but the market has changed.\u201dRelated: Governor Healey announces plan to eliminate renter-paid broker feesSome brokers focus on hawking cheaper rentals to Boston\u2019s flood of college students. Others work in specific neighborhoods.Rob Oteri, who founded the rental site JPRentals, focuses mainly on apartments in Jamaica Plain, where he lives. He said he tries to maintain personal relationships with landlords and works diligently with prospective renters to help them find the best place for them in their price range.When brokers do their job well, Oteri said, the fee shouldn\u2019t be quite so painful. But theirs is a volume business, and some brokers simply try to lease as many units as possible as quickly as possible. That leads to instances, he said, when brokers show up to lead apartment tours without ever having seen the unit.\u201cI certainly understand the frustration with some brokers who maybe have a \u2018turn and burn\u2019 mentality about the work,\u201d Oteri said. \u201cBut a good broker earns their money by working closely with tenants to get them the best deal.\u201dAdvertisementMacdonald\u2019s day has taken him into Allston, near Commonwealth Avenue, where he has picked up keys from one of the city\u2019s biggest student landlords, Alpha Management, so he can take photos of Alpha apartments that will soon come on the market.His first stop is a clean but tiny one-bedroom with a closet too thin for a person to stand in. It has nice natural light and a full kitchen.\u201cThis one will go fast,\u201d he says while taking note of the \u201cstandalone closet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Macdonald checks out an apartment in Allston before creating a listing on his brokerage's website.\n   \t\t(John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Macdonald on the phone in the Jacob Realty office.\n   \t\t\t\t (John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\n\nAs he drives toward his next stop, he defends the value of his profession.Finding apartments without brokers, he says, would be harder, because there would be no one to cultivate and centralize listings and organize tours. And his knowledge of the market helps him find renters the best deals, which is his top priority.\u201cIt\u2019s the free market,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it.\u201dRelated: Renters are vexed by broker fees.

        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nIf you\u2019re buying a condo, you\u2019ve probably reviewed the rules and regulations of the condominium association to confirm they don\u2019t conflict with your planned use of the property. But did you check out the association itself? Failing to ensure that the association\u2019s finances are healthy can lead to huge bills for unsuspecting unit owners.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that a buyer could have a special assessment in the thousands of dollars,\u2019\u2019 saidLinda Barrett, vice president of Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boston. \u201cShould the building\u2019s roof need to be replaced, you could end up with a very high special assessment if the association does not have good reserves.\u2019\u2019\nOwners of condominiums pay regular assessments, usually monthly or quarterly, to cover the operating expenses of the association, as well as reserves \u2014 funds stashed away for future capital projects. But condo associations also can charge unit owners special assessments for emergencies or unusual circumstances, such as damage to the building caused by a winter storm.\nThat\u2019s why Barrett always prepares her condo buyers beforehand. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure buyers not only review the condominium documents, but two years of the budget as well,\u2019\u2019 she said. When she writes an offer, she also includes a contingency allowing the buyer to review the minutes of association board meetings for the past two years. \u201cYou could read in the minutes from a year ago that there\u2019s a problem with the roof,\u2019\u2019 she said. That could signal that a special assessment is in your future.\nRelatedSticker shock: Special assessments can send condo costs even higher. What buyers should be asking.\n\nPrior to closing on a one-bedroom condominium in Boston\u2019s Seaport District two years ago, Anne Stemlar, a legal administrator in Boston, reviewed the association\u2019s financial statements. \u201cI was looking at the health of the organization and what kind of financial reserves they had,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nStemlar concluded that the association was well run, with healthy reserves, a capital budget, and a plan for improvements. But she had an advantage since she had owned two units previously and served on a condo association board of directors. First-time buyers should rely on their real estate agent and lawyer for help reviewing these documents. \u201cAsk a lot of questions, and make sure you come to a comfort level,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nIn addition to reviewing the rules and regulations of the association to ensure you won\u2019t be in violation if you own a large dog, drive a truck, or want to rent your unit, be sure to conduct the following due diligence on the financial stability of the association:\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the past two operating budgets, as well as two years\u2019 worth of board and annual meeting minutes. Be wary if assessments haven\u2019t increased over time; since the cost of goods and services have gone up, maintenance fees should have followed.\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the reserve study of the major capital components of the building, and make sure there are adequate funds to replace them on schedule.\n\u25a0\u00a0Ask questions. Dawn Bauman, senior vice president for government and public affairs at theCommunity Associations Institute, an industry group, said condo buyers should inquire about routine maintenance of the building, whether the board expects to increase assessments, and whether there is a current special assessment or one pending or imminent. Try to talk to the seller, the property manager, and board members.\n\u25a0\u00a0Be skeptical about the operating budget for new construction. Developers often subsidize the expenses of the association by paying costs such as landscaping or snow removal, so it\u2019s common for assessments to increase once the unit owners take control of the association.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t ignore insurance.Spencer M. Houldin, president of Ericson Insurance Advisors in Boston, suggested that condo buyers determine the insurance obligations of both the association and the unit owners. Typically, Houldin said, the association insures the building, while owners are responsible for everything inside their units. Have your insurance agent or lawyer review the association\u2019s insurance to make sure it\u2019s sufficient to rebuild the structure. All unit owners should carry anHO-6 policythat covers the interior of their units and liability.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t waive your right to review association financials. \u201cIt\u2019s a seller\u2019s market, and buyers are willing to overlook things like reserves because they\u2019re just happy they found a place and their offer was accepted,\u2019\u2019 saidMichael Merrill, a real estate and condominium law attorney in Boston. But even if you waive mortgage and inspection contingencies, be wary of waiving a budget review.\n\u201cThat way, when you do become an owner, you\u2019re not surprised by the amount of money you may have to put in to solve a problem,\u2019\u2019 Merrill said.\nRobyn A.

        "content": "By Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen it comes to online gardening trends and how they translate to reality, mileage can vary.\n\n\u201cChaos gardening\u201d lit upTikToklast year, its advocates tossing fistfuls of seed into soil \u2014 or even grass \u2014 while seeming to hope fora wildflower meadow. There are reasons that a planned approach can yield more reliable results: crowding plants can outcompete one another, and not all seeds will thrive in every yard placement. But for some who practice it in the Boston area, chaos gardening is more than an online trend: It\u2019s a longtime mindset they say has helped them maintain a more forgiving relationship with their spaces, easing up on their expectations and enjoying the garden on its own terms.\n\n\u201cI do have ideas for what I want to grow, but whatever works,\u201d said Dana Werbin, who gardens in Jamaica Plain. \u201cIf a seed grows there, that means it likes the conditions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Werbin\u2019s approach lacks design: It\u2019s just that the garden is, to a greater extent than some, also the designer. Their \u201cvolunteer\u201d tomatoes \u2014 ones that sprout from dropped seeds, tend to do better than planted seedlings, for example.\n\n\u201cI could make the decision to rip it up and plant it elsewhere, but it already made the decision that it likes where it is, so I\u2019m not gonna mess that up,\u201d they said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s going to give me good tomatoes.\u201d\n\nWerbin\u2019s description of their garden is a picture of both chaos and order. They don\u2019t know exactly where something will grow, but the garden will let them know. That\u2019s where they will find the scallions this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a percentage of, like, 70 percent chaos, 30 percent order,\u201d they said.\n\nFor Kris Engdahl, the decision opened up a neighborhood conversation.\n\n\nShe sees her chaos garden approach as an outcropping ofmilpa gardening, a sustainable and regenerative indigenous practice related to the \u201cthree sisters\u201d method of planting corn, beans, and squash together. Engdahl\u2019s Watertown front yard received a lot of street salt, which seemed to encourage crabgrass. So, she tore it up and tried flowers: roses, marigolds, and impatiens. But her interest turned to growing food, and she thought,why not?She replaced flowers with a range of vegetables and herbs. Sometimes she added more flowers. Sometimes, tricolor chard. She followed her whims, and soon the garden followed its own.\n\n\nAs  it evolved, the garden\u2019s proximity to the sidewalk attracted interest. Located a short walk to a community path, the foot traffic is frequent. The variety became a magnetic conversation-starter. A group of passersby, with her permission, harvested cilantro. A woman took chard and returned the next day with a delicious recipe she made with it.\n\nWith each season, different plantings would express themselves with more or less influence. One year, Engdahl\u2019s garden was dominated by dill and daikon (white radish). Sometimes pumpkins popped up; sometimes green beans would thrive.\n\nAnd while it can feel that way to Engdahl, to its admirers, the garden was not independent from its gardener. Last year, Engdahl said she fell behind on maintenance \u2014 stymied, as we all experience \u2014 by life and the heat wave. And even during these cold intermediate months, someone checked in.\n\n\u201cI had somebody on Sunday [ask]: \u2018How are you doing? We love looking at your garden. I was concerned about you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes the balance will seem off in some way, and Engdahl will correct it. One season\u2019s parsley, which produced months of winter broths, became next season\u2019s rabbit food.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will do something, and it will be wrong, but gardens are dynamic,\u201d she said. She plans to continue this year, following up on her practice of \u201cno dig\u201d gardening, adding her own homemade compost.\n\nGarden designerDemetra Tseckareshas found the chaos gardening mindset useful when responding to clients who are looking for lower maintenance. Meadows are a great fit for replacing a sunny lawn. Tseckares will hand-seed the area, but is careful to select intentionally, avoiding pre-sold mixes that can often include invasive or aggressive plant species.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get people to understand what a beautiful garden looks like in a different way, because these super neat, super tidy \u2026 cleaned-up gardens that don\u2019t allow a single leaf or a single stem to stand are dead zones, they kill an entire generation,\u201d Tseckares said of the insects that may use stems and leaves for habitat, supporting other parts of the wildlife population.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a more sustainable approach \u2014 including financially.\n\n\u201cYou can change it every year, or it will just do its own thing,\u201d she said, noting that gardeners can harvest seeds at the end of the season for next year\u2019s plantings.\n\nWerbin\u2019s next season, like many gardeners, will begin well before the last frost. Using a small greenhouse, they will start seedlings during the cold season. But they also will practice experimental sowing with a packet of their own mixed seeds as an intentional surprise, to see what comes up.\n\nNot every experiment is fruitful. Last year, Werbin nurtured a plant they thought was ginger. It turned out to be grass.\n\n\u201cI was giving so much love to this weed, thinking that it was going to turn into something, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d they said.\n\nBut care and forgiveness are never wasted. Now Werbin, who has a professional horticulture background, is studying for a career pivot into nursing.\n\n\u201cCultivating a rapport with your patients is just like getting the soil ready,\u201d she said. Their approach to gardening required openness and nonjudgmental thinking. They talk to their plants. And they are carrying that practice into their nursing study.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the same student nurse, if I didn\u2019t have that experience,\u201d said Werbin.\n\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\n\n\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "Wishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.",
        "content": "By Ann Carrns, New York Times Service\n\nWishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.\n\nBut many people don\u2019t realize myriad programs offer grants or loans to help home buyers come up with the necessary funds. \u201cThere are tons of programs to assist them,\u201d said Deatra Kemp, an advocate for first-time home buyers in Milwaukee.\n\nThe programs can ease some of the daunting numbers behind buying a house. The median price of a home has risen to more than $400,000, meaning the once-traditional 20 percent down payment \u2014 an amount paid in cash toward the purchase of a home, in addition to the amount borrowed for a mortgage \u2014 would be about $80,000. And typical house prices are significantly higher in some parts of the country like Massachusetts. The Warren Group reported Tuesday that the median sales price for a single-family home in the state hit $615,000 in December, a year-over-year jump of 11.1 percent. The median condo price in Massachusetts was $521,750, a 5 percent increase.\n\nEven putting down 5 percent to 10 percent is a stretch because rising rents have made it harder for people to save, said Teig Whaley-Smith, chief alliance executive for the Community Development Alliance, a nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes affordable homeownership as a path to racial equity. \u201cFor working families,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s next to impossible.\u201d\n\nPlus, increasing mortgage interest rates, which drive up monthly costs, don\u2019t help. Last week, rates fora 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose above 7 percentfor the first time since May, according toFreddie Mac, the federally backed mortgage finance giant.\n\nSonu Mittal, senior vice president and head of the single-family acquisitions division at Freddie Mac, said that outside of high prices and interest rates, which consumers can\u2019t control, raising a down payment \u201ccontinues to be the No. 1 barrier to homeownership.\u201d\n\nBut down-payment assistance options can help buyers come up with the necessary cash. When combined with loan programs that allow buyers to put less money down \u2014 as little as 3 percent of the home\u2019s purchase price, in some cases \u2014 the help can make buying a home a reality.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible in some cases to put no money down. Two federal government programs offer zero percent down-payment loans to borrowers who meet specific criteria. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers full financing for veterans and those on active military duty, and the Department of Agriculture guarantees zero percent down-payment loans in rural areas.\n\n\u201cTwenty-percent down is a myth,\u201d Kemp said. The typical down payment for first-time buyers in 2024 was 9 percent, according to theNational Association of Realtors. Yet the notion that higher down payments are needed persists. As a result, many people of modest means don\u2019t even consider the notion of owning a home, said Kemp, vice president of programs atActs Housing, a nonprofit that provides financial coaching and other services to help renters become homeowners.\n\nStill, finding the right assistance program isn\u2019t easy.A 2023 report from the Urban Institute,a nonprofit research group, identified more than 1,600 government programs across the country designed to help with down payments. Some are offered by the federal government, others by state housing finance agencies or county and local governments. Community-funded organizations and even commercial lenders may also offer help.\n\nMost, but not all, programs serve first-time buyers, and most set income limits for borrowers \u2014 typically based on the median income in the home\u2019s area. The dizzying assortment of programs, which have varying criteria and geographic restrictions, can make it challenging to identify and apply for available help.\n\n\u201cHome buyers don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Ashley Moore, community lending manager withChase Home Lendingin Houston.\n\nSome programs offer grants, which don\u2019t need to be repaid, but most offer help in the form of a low- or no-interest second mortgage, meaning there is additional debt on the home. Payments on the loans, however, are often deferred, meaning you don\u2019t have to start paying them back right away, and the loans may be forgiven if you remain in the home for a certain period of time \u2014 often five years.\nMore on home buyingMore home buyers are asking relatives for down payment helpMedian down payment tops $105k for metro Boston home buyersSpring House Hunt: Why you don\u2019t need 20% down to buy a home\nJung Hyun Choi, principal research associate for the Urban Institute\u2019s housing finance policy center, said borrowers may combine benefits of several different down-payment programs, a practice sometimes called \u201cstacking,\u201d to come up with the necessary funds. But it can take time and effort to find and apply for various programs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty complicated,\u201d she said, and can drag out the buying process.\n\nGroups like Acts Housing seek to help borrowers identify the right programs and often find that borrowers are eligible for more than one. \u201cWe love to stack,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nActs Housing recently worked with a buyer who was able to get $19,500 in down-payment assistance from a combination of grants from federal and private lenders and a city program, she said. The buyer put down less than $700 out of pocket at closing for a home in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cGet all the grants you deserve,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave any money on the table.\u201d\n\nThe borrower, Latoya Myrick, 44, who works in community services, said the assistance had enabled her to buy a duplex for about $200,000, realizing a longtime goal of owning her own home. She had tried before, she said, but didn\u2019t have enough for a down payment. She closed on Jan. 6 and will soon move in. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d\n\nOther resources are emerging to help home buyers find down-payment assistance. Freddie Mac in late 2023 began offering a free online search tool,DPA One,to help lenders and housing counselors match eligible borrowers with down-payment help.\n\n\u201cLoan officers may not even know there is a program available,\u201d Mittal said. \u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t miss those opportunities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say how many homes have been purchased because of the new offering, Mittal said, but the tool is gaining traction. About 7,000 loan officers use the tool, which now has information on about 800 programs across 50 states and the District of Columbia. (Home buyers can try DPA One, but it\u2019s mainly intended for professionals.)\n\nAnother option isDown Payment Resource, an online search tool. Borrowers enter details about themselves and the type of home they want and can get information about programs for which they may be eligible.\n\nYou can also contact your state housing finance authority or work with a housing counseling agency certified by the federalDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentto learn about available programs. You can search on the HUD website for agencies in your area.\n\n\nWill using a down-payment assistance program cause the interest rate on my loan to be higher?\n\nSome predatory lenders may charge a higher rate to borrowers using assistance programs, Kemp said. When that happens, counselors at certified housing agencies can work with buyers to find lenders who won\u2019t penalize borrowers using down-payment help, she said.\n\nCan I use a family gift to help with a down payment?\n\nLenders may allow gifts from close family members to be included as part of a down payment. In 2024, 8 percent of homebuyers (and 21 percent of first-time buyers) said they had used a gift from a relative or friend, according to the National Association of Realtors. You may need to provide a letter signed by the donor to document that the money doesn\u2019t need to be repaid, according to credit bureauExperian.\n\nDo private lenders offer assistance with down payments?\n\nSome do. Chase, for instance, offers grants of up to $7,500 in eligible areas, including federally identified neighborhoods with majority Black, Hispanic, or Latino populations, that can be used toward a down payment or to reduce a home loan\u2019s interest rate or closing costs.

The price? $7,495,000.\nThe legendary actress,who died in 1969, rented the home while her daughter,Liza Minnelli, performed at theCape Cod Melody Tent. Minnelli also worked as an assistant at the legendary venue as a teen, where she was responsible for changing scenery, the startold the Cape Cod Timesin 2007.\n\u201cIt was funny because Judy called my grandfather one day, less than a day before Liza was performing, and said: \u2018Bill, my daughter is very nervous.

In the foyer, hardwood floors and a blue-carpeted staircase greet you.\nTo the right, you\u2019ll find a 244-square-foot sitting room with three windows and a fireplace that\u2019s boarded.\nTo the left is the living room, a 580-square-foot space with white beamed ceilings and a stone fireplace. Across the room, a bay window offers a sunny spot on a built-in seat. The living room flows naturally into the 277-square-foot dining room, where dark beamed ceilings run overhead and a set of doors leads back out to the porch, the perfect place for taking in the sunset after dinner.\nStep through a door to the bright eat-in kitchen (329 square feet), where a small room to the left serves as a pantry and laundry area. In the kitchen, you\u2019ll find stainless steel appliances and natural stone countertops surrounded by white cabinetry. There\u2019s a double window over the sink.\nA second door offers direct access to the foyer, while a third door reveals a roomy, but unheated, back hallway that continues into a utility and storage room (477 square feet). A half bath completes this level. Only two of these bedrooms are included in the overall bedroom count.\nThe hallway also provides access to a back staircase you can take to four bedrooms and a full bath with a claw-foot tub. This part of the home is not heated.\nBack in the main portion of the home, the main staircase ascends to a bedroom level that holds the primary suite, four other bedrooms ranging from 178 to 268 square feet, and three full bathrooms.\nIn the primary bedroom, expansive windows provide views of the water hitting the beach from the 432-square-foot room. \u00a0Blue carpeting runs throughout the space, which has double closets.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nAfter six years of fighting, residents of the Fairlawn Estates in Mattapan can breathe a sigh of relief: their market-rate homes will permanently become affordable.\n\u201cBy securing these homes as permanently affordable, we are continuing our efforts to make Boston a home for everyone and ensuring that families can continue to live and thrive in their neighborhood without the fear of being priced out,\u201d Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement.\nIn anannouncementon Monday, the city said it invested $10 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to support Related Beal\u2019s acquisition of the Fairlawn Estates, permanently converting the housing to affordable homes.\nThe investment is also part of the city\u2019sAcquisition Opportunity Program, which helps developers buy and preserve existing affordable housing.\nThe acquisition was possible through city funds, private investment, and loans. The newly created Boston Acquisition Fund provided a nearly $1 million commitment.\nThe Fairlawn Estates comprises 12 apartment buildings and a leasing office on Fairlawn Avenue, Cummins Highway, and Bismarck Street.\nThe release said the Flatley Companies constructed the complex in the 1960s, and it was known for its affordability. However, in 2018, that all changed when the long-awaited commuter rail stop opened across from the apartment complex. The building was sold to an investor group, and the property was rebranded as SoMa at the T. Residents faced increased rents, which resulted in evictions.\nThe new owner, Related Affordable, an affiliate of Related Beal, has committed to permanently restricting all 347 units to affordable housing.\n\u201cAffordable housing is core to Related\u2019s DNA, and we are thrilled to provide a more sustainable living solution in such an important, transit-oriented location in Mattapan,\u201d said Kimberly Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal.\nThe release said Related Affordable plans to invest $6.4 million in immediate repairs and building upgrades, including roof replacements, balcony repairs, and appliance upgrades in all apartments. Related Affordable will also focus on making the buildings more energy efficient.\nThe investment will ensure that half the apartments are for households earning no more than 60% of the Area Median Income, while the other half are for those earning no more than 80%.\nThe agreement with Related also limits rent increases to no more than 2% per year and provides ongoing support for households with housing vouchers.\nThe conversion to affordable housing follows years of advocacy and organizing by Fairlawn tenants, City Life/Vida Urbana, and neighbors in Mattapan.\n\u201cThe constant stress of facing huge rent increases and eviction weighed on us every day over the past six years, and it wasn\u2019t right \u2014 but we want people to know that housing is a human right and we can win the homes we deserve,\u201d said Betty Lewis, of the Fairlawn Tenant Association. \u201cThis is a community victory won by neighbors working together.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nBaby boomers own a significant chunk of the housing stock in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t count on that changing to solve the housing shortages anytime soon.\n\nBaby boomers \u2014 those from age 58 to 76 \u2014 accounted for nearly 39 percent of the homeowner pool statewide in 2023, according to Redfin\u2019s most recent data.\n\nNationwide, about 21 million homes are \u201cempty nests\u201d \u2014 those with at least three bedrooms and occupied by residents 55 and up with no children at home,according to Zillow.That has the potential to more than make up for the estimated 4.5 million unit national home shortage.\n\nBut for all the talk of a pending \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of generational wealth \u2014 and housing \u2014 transfer to younger demographics, experts caution this won\u2019t be a flash flood of supply.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in our industry have been thinking about this idea that there would be maybe a big wealth transfer, that maybe there would be a lot of baby boomers [with homes] coming on the market at some point,\u201d saidOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. \u201cBut unfortunately, our research shows that there\u2019s just not enough of those older families.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers also are staying in their homes longer than ever, meaning you likely shouldn\u2019t expect a sudden jolt of new supply:40 percent of American baby boomershave lived in their current homes for at least 20 years, according to Redfin.\n\nRedfin also noted empty-nest baby boomers owned 25 percent of large homes (those with at least three bedrooms) in Greater Boston in 2022 \u2014 compared to millennials with children owning just 12.5 percent of the supply.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s keeping these older homeowners parked in their current abodes rather than downsizing? Money talks, but the high cost of moving \u2014 especially when it pertains to higher mortgage rates compared to what they might have on their existing homes \u2014 has caused many to decide not to leave their longtime homes.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of baby boomersnationally planned to age in place, an increasingly standard plan for older homeowners, according to Redfin.\n\nEmpty nests would need to be more concentrated in markets with the largest housing shortages \u2014 like Greater Boston \u2014 to make a dent in home prices. But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn the local market, Zillow notes there are 281,773 empty nests, or about 14 percent of the local housing supply. That\u2019s slightly less than the 16 percent national average of empty nests found coast to coast.\n\n\u201cBoston is a younger place, and there\u2019s just not enough of these older homes available, even if all of them came on the market someday,\u201d Divounguy said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just empty nesters occupying larger homes that\u2019s driving some of the supply shortage.\n\n\u201cMany baby boomers have had very prosperous careers, and that has led to many of them owning multiple properties, whether it be that they own a primary residence and secondary for vacationing, or perhaps a primary and then also in owning investment properties as part of their portfolio,\u201d saidSarah Gustafson, president of theMassachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cWith that, they\u2019re taking up so much of that available inventory, it\u2019s exacerbating the housing shortage that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nMany older homeowners just prefer to stay where they are.\n\n\u201cThe most common reasons [for baby boomers deciding to age in place] are that people like where they live and that there is no good alternative for them,\u201d saidChen Zhao, economics research lead at Redfin. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it boils down to.\u201d\n\nThink of the pending generational wealth and housing supply transfer more like a trickle than a tsunami, according to the Redfin team. Higher mortgage rates and home prices increase the supply shortage in a market like Greater Boston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long while coming,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cBoston has probably one of the tighter home markets and is one of the places where it seems like the market is frozen.\u201d\n\nThere are a mix of policy levers a region like Greater Boston can pull to help younger generations with housing accessibility and affordability. Governor Maura Healey\u2019sUnlocking Housing Production Commissionexamined the state\u2019s housing shortage and notedsingle-family-only zoning is a key obstacle, blocking more housing construction.\n\nThe commission recommended eliminating single-family zoning across the state in a move that wouldn\u2019t ban single-family homes from being constructed. Instead, the measure would prohibit municipal governments from blocking many multi-unit housing proposals on residential lots.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not to wait and hope for existing homes to come on the market. It\u2019s to help the builders build more housing,\u201d Zillow\u2019s Divounguy said. \u201cBoston happens to be one of the more restrictive markets in terms of building restrictions. It means loosening some of these building restrictions in the metro area and allowing for more construction.\u201d\n\nThere also are much longer-term solutions to some of the housing shortage. Baby boomers and millennials are larger generations, and that presents a multigenerational need for housing.\n\nBut declining birth rates in the US and expected lower immigration rates also can mean decreased housing demand in the distant future \u2014 emphasis on distant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen immediately, but at some point this does make a difference for housing demand and our housing shortage,\u201d Zhao said.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nTaylor Halldeparted theBruinsfor theChicago Blackhawksback in 2023, but the hockey player\u2019s Fort Point condo is up for grabs. The four-bedroom, 3.5-bath unit is listed for $4,099,000.\nBuilt at the turn of the last century, 355 Congress St. was originally known asTremont Electric Lighting Co.At the time, you would find the company\u2019s machine shop on the first floor, where they built electric meters and motors. The lamp department was on the second floor, according to historical documents. (These days, the brick beauty of a building is better known as the home ofLucky\u2019s Lounge.)\nDespite its historic bona fides,Unit 601exudes a modern sensibility.\nStep inside the building\u2019s secure entrance, equipped with aButterflyMXaccess-control system. Steps head up to the lobby floor, where you\u2019ll find the mailroom to the left. Take the historic elevator to the fifth floor.\nThe foyer is on the bedroom level. Closets on both sides await your boots, coats, and hockey bag. Tired from pond skating? There\u2019s a bedroom straight ahead. The nearly 114-square-foot space does not have a closet but could easily function as a home office or den.\nBack in the hallway, there\u2019s a glass staircase on the left and a long hallway that features utilities, storage, and laundry. There\u2019s also a full bathroom with a tub and access to a 193-square-foot bedroom that boasts stunning views of the brick-filled neighborhood. Next door to that is a slightly bigger bedroom (198 square feet) that features double-door closets and beautiful views of the neighborhood and Farnsworth Street. The en-suite bath has a glass-enclosed shower and an entrance from the hallway.\nClimb the glass staircase to the living level, which offers 13-foot ceilings and an open floor plan that the staircase cuts in half. A few steps down, and you\u2019re in the 593-square-foot living room. Grab a seat around the fireplace, which is surrounded by Carrara marble and has wood features above it around a built-in television. Floating shelves sit on the left and right, while a bar area with refrigerated drawers is ready for you to stock up for entertaining.\n\u201cYou can see the Fort Point sign from the living room window,\u201d\u00a0 saidAmy Carlisle, lead\u00a0of The Carlisle Group at Compass, who has thelisting. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pretty view.\u201d\nFrom the living room, a door opens to a long, narrow deck. That deck lines the outside of the condo and leads to the 1,022-square-foot main deck, with direct access to the 200-square-foot primary bedroom suite. The suite\u2019s 86-square-foot walk-through closet comes with built-ins and ushers you through to a stunning primary bath that\u2019s home to dual vanities, a shower, and a motorized toilet.\nThe dining room (134 square feet) is also off the hallway. It features sliding doors that open out to the main deck. The dining area is off the 320-square-foot kitchen, which has an integrated refrigerator and high-gloss white cabinets. A gray stone island anchors the space, which has same pale hardwood flooring that runs throughout the home. There\u2019s also a half bathroom off that room.\nClimb the glass stairs up another flight to the condo\u2019s beautiful roof deck, which faces the harbor. The 315-square-foot space offers views that stretch into the Financial District.\nThe condo, which a developer transformed in 2018, has a $677 monthly homeowners association fee. It comes with a parking spot behind the building. A second parking spot is available for rent at the Farnsworth Garage for $500 a month. The building allows pets, according to the write-up on the Multiple Listing Service.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "By ANDRE MUGGIATI, Associated Press\n\nWELLFLEET, Mass. (AP) \u2014A luxury home that had been on the verge of tumbling into Cape Cod Baydue to erosion has been demolished.\n\nA potential collapse of the 5,100-square-foot home threatened oyster beds in nearby Wellfleet Harbor, but a dispute over its removal had left it teetering on the edge of a sandy bluff for months. But on Monday, heavy machinery rolled in to remove the house piece by piece, with trucks carrying it away. By Tuesday, only its concrete slab, chimney and a generator remained.\n\n\u201cOn one side, it is sad because it was a beautiful house that became a landmark in that place,\u201d said John Cobler, a member of the Wellfleet Environmental Commission. \u201cOn the other, I am happy that it is gone. It is a great relief for our town and for our environment.\u201d\nA luxury house is close to tumbling into Cape Cod Bay. Will anyone stop it?\nCobler said attorneys for owner John Bonomi filed a request with the town last week to remove the house. An attorney for Bonomi declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nThe house was built in 2010 on the bay side of the Cape Cod peninsula. Its original owners sought permission in 2018 to build a seawall to stave off erosion. The commission rejected the seawall out of concern for unintended effects on the beach and how water carries nutrients in the bay. They also questioned whether it would save the house.\n\nIn 2019, Bonomi, a New York attorney, bought the house for $5.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the erosion advanced. A report prepared for Wellfleet last year estimated the house would fall down the bluff within three years, potentially sending debris into a harbor where shellfish farmers grow the town\u2019s namesake oysters, and the environment commission asked Bonomi for a plan to remove the house.\n\nJust a week before the demolition, strong winds battered the cape for three days, exposing more of the home\u2019s concrete pillars.\n\nAn attorney for Bonomi had told the commission at its January meeting that the house had been sold to a salvage company that would not fund removal of the house. But the town\u2019s conservation agent noted at the time that no transfer of deed had been recorded, and a check of records Tuesday also found no record of sale.\nSign up for the Today newsletterGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

Ellement, The Boston Globe\n\n639 Corea Road, Gouldsboro, Maine\n\n$799,000\n\nStyleContemporary\n\nYear built1950; updated 2024\n\nSquare feet2,500\n\nBedrooms3\n\nBaths2 full\n\nSewer/WaterPrivate\n\nTaxes$2,874 (2025)\n\nIt\u2019s found on the rugged coastline near the town of Gouldsboro, Maine, and in the backyard there are views ofSchoodic Peninsulaharbor, where commercial fish and lobster boats still sail out to the Gulf of Maine.\n\nWhat we are talking about is pink granite, and large chunks of it are formed into a fire circle in the backyard of this 2,500-square-foot home in a town that boasts five distinct villages and 55 miles of coastline within its boundaries.\n\n\nBut before sharing stories around a backyard fire, take a walk through this 75-year-old home that was fully updated in 2024. From the driveway, walk past the deck overlooking the sloping front yard to reach the front door at the top of three stone steps.\n\nIt opens into the living room that features a black gas fireplace, and the updated white oak engineered hardwood throughout the house. There are views of the town and harbor.\n\n\nTo the left, a central hallway connects to the rest of the rooms on this level. The first to appear is the fully updated kitchen on the left. It\u2019s a study in white, black, and glistening silver.\n\nThe countertops on the large island and the counters are white quartz flecked with gray. The cabinets are white, but the faucet and the island are black. The range is fueled by gas, and the appliances are stainless steel. A slider connects to the backyard, and the ceiling is knotty planks. Beyond the kitchen is a dining area with access to the front deck amid three large double-hung windows.\n\n\nOn the right side of the house is the first full bath, which has a single vanity sink with a quartz top. The shower has a clear glass door with a gray subway tile backsplash.The flooring in both the shower and the bathroom is stone mosaic tile,with radiant heat below the walking space. There is also a large closet and laundry room with space for full-size appliances.\n\n\nCompleting this floor is a large bedroom in the rear of the house.\n\nThe primary bedroom is on the second floor in the left corner of the home, providing scenic views from the double-hung windows on two exterior walls. The interior wall is decorated with white shiplap. The entrance to the bathroom is framed by wood timbers and the door itself is a barn-style slider.\n\n\nThe full bath \u2014 shared with another bedroom \u2014 features a white oval soaking tub and a double vanity with gold faucets, a white quartz countertop, and a Navy blue wood cabinet. The shower is behind gold-framed glass and has a stone mosaic tile floor and a gray tile backsplash. There is a square rain shower head. This bathroom also has radiant heat flooring.\n\n\nOn the other side is another bedroom, now outfitted with a pair of twin beds. There are double-hung windows on two exterior walls.\n\nThe third floor can be used as a rec room, but is currently set up with two twin beds along with four comfortable chairs. The walls have shiplap molding and two windows in the corner look out to the harbor.\n\nThe basement has a dirt floor and storage space.\n\nAccording to the listing agent,Tacy Ridlonof Better Homes & Gardens The Masiello Group in Ellsworth, Maine, Gouldsboro does not restrict rentals in a town where the summer population doubles to about 3,400.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nThe Bay State might have the misfortune of being labeled \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d but experts point to how it\u2019s not as bad as itcouldbe from a property tax standpoint. That distinction goes to New Jersey \u2014 at least this year, anyway.\n\nStill, Massachusettshome buyersshouldn\u2019t be caught off guard by property tax increases, which can add even more financial stress to homeownership.\n\n\u201cOver time, property taxes have inched up, but I think it\u2019s really about how the counties and the state manage their financials,\u201d saidEllen Steinfeld, senior executive vice president of consumer lending and payments at Berkshire Bank.\n\nProperty taxes are what homeowners pay to their city or town based on the assessed value of their home and the municipal tax rate. This tax rate varies by community and largely depends on a municipality\u2019s financial status and spending levels.\n\nIf you average these tax rates,the effective property tax rateacross Massachusetts is 1.14 percent on every assessed dollar \u2014 making Massachusetts the 18th highest of any US state and the District of Columbia, according toRocket Mortgage.\n\nNew Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the country. Illinois, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut round out the top five, respectively.\n\nPlus,a study the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership and the Donahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, released Monday ranked the state 46th (from strongest to weakest) in the nation when it comes to state and local tax collections per capita as a competitive weakness.\nMore Fall House HuntThe fix is in. Shoppers flock to buy homes that need work.All the world\u2019s a stage, so make your home its starThe median home price in Mass. in July was $650k. Here\u2019s what that gets you now.\nRates can vary significantly within the state itself.\n\nAlmost one-third of Massachusetts municipalities have split property tax rates between commercial and residential dwellings, according to thePioneer Institute of Public Policy Research, a maneuver some states use to offset the high cost of housing with a reduced tax burden. This often means municipalities with higher commercial bases can have lower residential taxes.\n\nBucolic Wendell \u2014 with a municipal property tax rate of $22.15 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 had the highest rates in the state in fiscal 2024, according to theMassachusetts Department of Revenue. Chilmark on Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2014 at $2.12 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 has the lowest. Some communities like Boston also offer a residential tax exemption that \u201creduces your tax bill by excluding a portion of your residential property\u2019s value from taxation. Last fiscal year, the residential exemption will [have] saved qualified Boston homeowners up to $3,610.53 on their tax bill.\u201d\n\nCommercial and industrial property owners paid 58 percent of all property taxes in 2022 compared to 42 percent of residential property owners, per the Pioneer Institute report. But there is concern this balance could shift more toward residential property owners amid higher vacancy rates in commercial buildings following the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into property taxes, but generally, I don\u2019t see higher property taxes as a bad thing,\u201d saidDaryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cThe downside of having property taxes very low is that it makes housing a more appealing financial investment, and then that can crowd out first-time home buyers if investors are buying homes simply because it has favorable taxes.\u201d\n\nFurther, it\u2019s important for homeowners to keep tabs on how frequent towns reassess property values to avoid sticker shock.\n\n\u201cSome municipalities do their assessments frequently, so the changes aren\u2019t as big,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cSome will do assessments more sporadically, and then people can get pretty big shocks when they go and see how much their home has been reassessed for.\u201d\n\nA reassessment doesn\u2019t have to be the final verdict, however. You can contest an assessment by filing an abatement application with your local tax assessor\u2019s office for potential overvaluation. Further, senior citizens are eligible for property tax credits and exemptions.\n\nMassachusetts has a safeguard against municipalities going overboard with hikes: Proposition 2\u00bd prevents a town from raising the rate more than 2.5 percent a year without a majority override vote.\n\nThere was an expectation coming out of the pandemic thatoverride votes would increase amid rising inflationand dwindling government relief funds to cover budget shortfalls. That appears to be precisely what happened.\n\nProp 2\u00bd override votes are becoming increasingly common: Nearly 100 such votes have taken place in the past 18 months \u2014 the most seen in more than a decade, the Globe\u2019s James Vaznisreported in July. About two-thirds of them were successful.\n\nPerhaps the nickname \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d at least when it comes to property tax hikes on the horizon, isn\u2019t such an overstatement after all.\n\nSend comments to[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress newsletterGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

It was built in 2001.\nPerched at the beginning of the street behind a fieldstone wall overlooking the Dedham Country & Polo Club, a short flight of steps up to the front door brings guests into the stunning two-story foyer under a sparkling chandelier. Boasting an open floor plan, it features hardwood floors and custom woodwork running throughout the dramatic space.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nThat stubborn, dirt-flecked pile of snow in the shady corner of my garden serves as an unwelcome reminder of the winter season, now only a few weeks from coming to an official end. Sunshine and warmer temperatures this past week have lifted my spirits nearly as much as seeing the first of the blooming snowdrops I planted last year push through the earth. Students of nature will have observed the buds swelling on trees and shrubs, while the bud scales of early blooming willows shyly reveal their silvery, furry flower buds underneath.\n\nWe are on the cusp of spring returning to New England. Gardeners recognize the invigorating energy, the drive to return outside that spring awakens within us. Whether you have started seeds in your basement, greenhouse, or kitchen, the excitement is palpable.\n\nMy thoughts now turn to bed preparation, clean up of winter debris, and cutbacks of last year\u2019s stems. Here are a few things to consider as you get ready for spring cleanup.\n\nLeaving stems standing over winter has loads of benefits, from protecting the crown of the plant, providing habitat and nesting for bees and other wildlife, as well as extending the aesthetic interest of your garden. But now that winter is almost over, when is it safe to cut those stems back? A good rule of thumb is to wait until you observe flying insects in your garden. In our area, that\u2019s usually from late March into early April, depending on the weather trends.\n\nFor mulch, I like to leave as much leaf litter in the beds as possible in the fall while collecting leaves from the lawn into a pile. If I have time and motivation, I may run them over with the lawn mower to chop them smaller. That pile of composting leaves is now a great source to top-dress any sections of planting beds blown bare by winter winds. Smaller pieces are easy to work with around the emerging stems, leaves, and blossoms of spring bulbs and perennials.\n\nFor some tips on bed preparation, let us turn to a reader question:\n\nQ.This spring, I plan to move a 6-foot-long by 3-foot-deep bed of hydrangeas about 4 feet behind their current location. The new location currently is overrun with various wild woodland plants/weeds. The new location is lower than the current bed, and I will fill it with about 3 to 4 feet of new loam. Once transplanted, I will add about 3 inches of mulch.\n\nMy question is: Should I use a herbicide to kill current, unwanted undergrowth before filling with new loam? Will using a herbicide create a risk to the transplanted hydrangeas? Will simply adding 4 to 4 feet of new loam on top of existing wild plants stifle any new growth without applying herbicide?\n\nKevin,Natick\n\nA.The tenets ofintegrated pest management(IPM) teach us to approach pest or weed management in an environmentally sensitive manner. The first step is to observe and learn about your problem. Our reader has identified unwanted plants that may threaten his plans to establish a new bed. Before reaching for the herbicide, let\u2019s consider a few nontoxic solutions that would solve the problem without using chemicals.\n\nThe next step in this scenario would be to consider a physical barrier to smother the unwanted plants. Given the amount of loam planned to be added on top, I would put down a layer of cardboard first before the loam is piled on. While the herbicide might not impact the hydrangeas, it will affect the beneficial life found in the loam. Soil is alive with countless organisms that help break down and repackage organic matter into forms that plants can use. Keeping your soil healthy will keep your garden growing abundantly.\n\nIf you believe the weeds to be especially tenacious, you can escalate the solution to nontoxic herbicides that use active ingredients like vinegar, citric acid, or botanical oils.Arbico Organicsis a great source for these types of products. Organic herbicides are safe to use around people and pets and will not affect the soil kingdom.\n\nAfter exhausting all other alternatives, then and only then, consider turning to chemical herbicides. The IPM approach ensures that we continue to move away from the days of blanket spraying your plants to the use of organic products delivered with very targeted applications using the smallest amount needed. Happy spring, my fellow gardeners, I hope to see you over the garden gate soon!\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

There are two double-hung windows on the two exterior walls, hardwood flooring, and an antique period medallion as the central light fixture. The current owner has placed a table with seating for six. On the right side, there is a wide pass-through into the kitchen, and at the end of the room is a custom-built China cabinet that is original to the 145-year-old home.\n\n\nKitchens are considered the heart of the home, and this iteration absolutely qualifies.

There is a large closet and double-hung windows on three exterior walls. The flooring is hardwood.\n\n\nThe second bedroom is 165 square feet and also has a skylight.

        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nHouses in New England are a special breed. Plenty of them are more than 100 years old, while others make the most of narrow floor plans on tiny lots. Historic districts, zoning restrictions, and other guardrails can add layers of red tape while renovating or expanding these homes.\n\nTo work around some of these rules, builders and architects have had to get creative \u2014 whether that\u2019s carving out additional storage space from some unused corner or transforming an oddly shaped nook into something more useful. Ahead, find three unique home projects that maximize each home\u2019s nooks and crannies.\n\n\nWhen Rajiv Raman set out to convert the garage of his 1870s Somerville home into another bedroom, he knew he might encounter a few challenges. For one, working within the home\u2019s small footprint would be complex, and removing and adding walls was likely to affect other parts of the house.\n\nThat was the case in Raman\u2019s small kitchen, which needed to be expanded to connect the garage to the main house. The problem? The only wall offering natural light into the space needed to go. \u201cWe knew that we would have to get rid of the bay window in our kitchen, but we didn\u2019t want to just wall it off,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe wanted to create some other source of light in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nSo he brainstormed with his architect, Patrick Rettig, to find a unique solution: Building a \u201cskylight nook\u201d as an additional lounge area for his two kids, with rows of windows to let sunlight into the kitchen. Now, this 5\u00bd-foot-tall bump-out is a place for the kids to play games, kick back with their Nintendo Switch or iPad, and do homework.\n\nSince the three windows on the wall looked directly out to their neighbor\u2019s roof deck, Raman attached window clings to create a frosted effect for privacy. For added customization, he ordered carpet fragments to cover the back of the built-in bench below the nook.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also this company on Amazon where you can just send them exact dimensions of very odd-shaped benches, and they\u2019ll custom make a cushion,\u201d he said, so he plopped the custom cushions on the bench to complete the new dining area created by the nook. The built-in bench and accompanying table freed up precious square footage in the kitchen, too.\n\n\u201cNow we have a kitchen you can actually walk around in,\u201d Raman said. \u201cIt really opened up the space by Somerville standards.\u201d\n\n\nRenovation projects located in historic districts naturally come with constraints. For his clients who lived in a half-Cape in Provincetown, Chris Brown, principal and founder ofb Architecture studio, knew the challenge was optimizing the home\u2019s original footprint without expanding it.\n\n\nThe first floor, in particular, was in desperate need of creative storage solutions. To find a place for everyday essentials, Brown modified the home\u2019s central staircase, building full-depth drawers below them for shoes and other mudroom accessories. Two triangular and two rectangular drawers are now equipped with heavy-duty drawer glides, allowing them to hold considerable weight.\n\n\nJust around the corner, the team also built an appliance storage cubby on the remaining underside of the staircase. Each cubby was custom-sized and built to fit both the coffee maker and microwave, effectively preventing them from cluttering the countertops.\n\n\u201cAnd then we still had a little bit of leftover space, and the clients asked \u2018What about a small wine fridge?\u2019\u201d Brown said. He devised a way to squeeze an eight- to 12-bottle wine fridge in the remaining nook. Now, Brown reasoned, the clients can enjoy an ideal use of that space.\n\n\u201cMaybe half of our projects, sometimes more, are dealing with at least some existing conditions, and certainly zoning and square footage constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love doing these types of creative, fun built-ins that let us think a little differently about what that space could be.\u201d\n\n\nWhile expanding their primary bathroom, the owners of a duplex in Charlestown were presented with a small conundrum: They needed to encroach into the floor plan of the adjoining guest bedroom \u2014 unevenly.\n\n\n\u201cIt became an odd footprint,\u201d explained Dennis Duffy, principal ofDuffy Design Group, since the expanded bathroom left an angular \u201chole\u201d in the bottom section of the wall.\n\nAt the same time, Duffy said the clients were keen to have a place where their guests could relax on their own, either to watch TV or read. The solution then materialized: The extra space could be converted into a \u201cpit\u201d for reading and relaxing, as well as additional sleeping space for visiting children. (Later, a TV was installed in the nook.)\n\n\u201c[The clients] loved the solution of the modular \u2018pit,\u2019\u201d Duffy said. They enthusiastically agreed to a graphic treatment off the interior wall, featuring strips of wood and offset disk light fixtures.\n\nAs for what to relax upon, the team selected a layout with cushions inspired byRoche Bobois\u2019s iconicMah Jong collection, a modular sofa that can be converted into countless different shapes.\n\nThe result is a cozy relaxation pit balancing equal parts comfort and style.\n\n\u201cHaving begun my career in New York City, I\u2019m used to working with small spaces,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI learned early on to try to find the best functional solutions for spaces like this, as long as it stays on message with the concept and adds functionality.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nAnyone who has ever taken a field trip to Salem will recognize the name tied to 252 Essex Street in Beverly, which is currently on the market for $600,000.\nGiles Corey, a farmer accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials, pleaded \u201cnot guilty.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d achieve a fair trial and refused to speak. He was subsequently sentenced to death by pressing\u00a0and became one of the most notable figures from the witch trials with the phrase he repeated as he died: \u201cMore weight.\u201d According to legend, that\u2019s what Corey repeatedly said to his executioners as they added more stones on top of him. (He was also written as a character in Arthur Miller\u2019sThe Crucible.)\nThe four-bed, two-bath property, which was first built in 1675 and underwent a variety of transformations over the years,\u00a0belonged to William Cleaves, who was Corey\u2019s son-in-law.\nSet on .79 of an acre, the 2,315-square-foot home looks almost plucked out of Corey\u2019s era thanks to everything from the wide-plank pine floors to the well in the basement (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s on city water now).\nA few steps up, on the right side of the home, under a small porch, brings you into an 184-square-foot kitchen, the first space built in the home. It features green tile floors, an operational 1930s stove, and a walk-in pantry. There\u2019s also a door to an additional staircase to the second story. Next door is the second dining room, a 222-square-foot space featuring wood floors and a ceiling with beams that resemble logs. The remnants of a chimney stack sit in the corner. A 267-square-foot living room has wide plank floors and a fireplace that should be inspected before use. Two windows overlook the stunning gardens and street. A green door to the right of the fireplace leads to the downstairs bathroom, which features a shower. A door to the left of the fireplace moves into the foyer, home to the main entrance of the home.\nContinue through to the second dining room, a charming 241-square-foot space with a built-in hutch, beamed ceiling, and easy access to the back patio through a door. The main kitchen, a 169-square-foot space, is next door and has a washer/dryer that\u2019s included in the sale, track lighting overhead, and a door to the other front porch. A French door leads into a pantry, while a thinner French door leads to a mini pantry. Another door leads to the back patio.\nHead back into the foyer to access the main staircase to the second story, where you\u2019ll find each of the four bedrooms. The top of the staircase is also home to the second full bathroom, which has a tub. A bonus room measuring 239 square feet is a great addition to the second story, and a walk-up attic provides extra storage space.\nThe home features a fieldstone and dirt basement. There is also a separate 1-car garage that measures 344 square feet, as well as a storage space that measures 121 square feet.\nThe home\u2019s outdoor spaces are some of its greatest features. The backyard, which is partially protected by conservation restrictions, is filled with trees, giant rocks, and a treehouse. The front yard is home to beautiful gardens, where wisteria hangs, and garden plots outlined by stone are frequently noticed by passersby.\n\u201cThe gardens are something that almost everybody knows,\u201d saysDiantha Phosithanof Engel & V\u00f6lkers By the Sea, who has thelisting.\nThe home will need a new roof \u201cpretty much right away.\u201d\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "A year after a landmark settlement called for a disruption in how real estate agents are paid, people say they still feel forced to pay them excessive commissions.",
        "content": "By Debra Kamin, New York Times Service\n\nWhen Mike Chambers was ready to sell his house in Boulder, Colorado, last month, he interviewed a handful of real estate agents who promised he could fetch $2.75 million or more if he listed with them.\n\nBut the promise would come at a cost: Each agent wanted him to pay a commission of at least 5%, or $137,500.\n\nFrustrated that not a single agent was willing to budge on the rate, Chambers, 39, decided to sell his house on his own, and he took to social media with the handle @realtorshateme to chronicle the process. His reels drew 50,000 views or more.\n\nWithin days, local agents were making their own social media posts that countered his points \u2014 an action Chambers described as an aggressive campaign aimed at preventing him from making a sale on his own.\n\nCall it the Realtor recoil.\n\nOne year after theNational Association of Realtors agreed, as part of a legal settlement, to change a key rule on real estate commissions \u2014 a rule that had long uphelda tradition of commissionsbetween 5% and 6%, little has changed.\n\nWhat was hailed as a watershed has so far produced a mere drizzle.\n\nSome economists predicted the rule change would upend the business model and bring competition to a long-stilted marketplace, breaking the standard 6% rate \u2014 one of the highest rates in the world \u2014 and forcing down home prices as a result.\n\nThough average commissions appear to be slipping, industry watchdogs say that Realtors and their brokerages have used workarounds and pressure on sellers like Chambers to subvert the settlement. So far, they\u2019re finding success.\n\n\u201cThe industry understood the threat to 5 or 6% rates right away, so looked for opportunities to discourage negotiation,\u201d said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Policy Center, who has been vocal about the need for greater consumer awareness in the real estate industry.\n\nReal estate commissions in the United States have long been baked into a home\u2019s listing price and then paid by the seller to their agent. The agent would then split that payout with the agent who brought a buyer, usually with 2.5% to 3% for each.\n\nThe rate of the commission split was communicated on private listing databases available only to agents, called multiple listing services, and in the lawsuit that led to the settlement,a group of home sellers in Missouriargued that the covert sharing of rates led to a lack of transparency about whom, and how much, home sellers were required to pay. They also argued it inflated fees.\n\nA jury agreed, and NAR and the brokerages were ordered to pay nearly $2 billion in damages. The settlement came five months later, with the NAR agreement to end the practice of commission-sharing over MLS databases as part of the deal. NAR also agreed to pay$418 million to settle the claims, and some brokerages separately settled for millions of dollars.\n\nAfter a six-month reprieve, the NAR rule changebecame official in August 2024. Average commissions dropped from 5.64% to 4.96% in the months that followed, which means a drop in commission of $2,870 on a median-priced home, according to a survey of 1,300 agents conducted by RISMedia, a real estate media company. (Two other studies, conducted by the online brokerage Redfin and the cloud-based real estate accounting firm AccountTech, found commissions have not changed, but those results could be considered biased because both organizations have a stake in the results.)\n\n\u201cThe system has been in place for 100 years. It\u2019s not going to change overnight,\u201d said Michael Ketchmark, the lawyer who represented the Missouri homeowners. \u201cIt\u2019s not like one day we started streaming movies and then Blockbuster video stores were suddenly gone. It was a slow progressive change in technology and that\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing here.\u201d\n\nMany agents say that since the settlement, they\u2019ve felt cornered by buyers and sellers alike to defend their value. Jeremy Larsen, a Realtor in Dallas, said that consumers who decide to navigate the home market without an agent are taking huge risks with their money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like walking into a courtroom without an attorney. Why would you do that? There\u2019s so many possible things that can go wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nOne viral Instagram video, created last month by a Realtor in Fresno, California, with 114,000 followers, shows a man driving down a suburban cul-de-sac and encountering a seller\u2019s agent standing outside a house for sale with a sign that reads \u201c0 percent\u201d \u2014 referring to the amount of commissions the sellers were willing to pay any agent who brought a buyer.\n\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nAt the house next door, also for sale, an agent holds a sign that reads \u201c3 percent.\u201d The man pulls over and says he\u2019d like to take a look.\n\nThe video may have been a joke, but its message was clear: Many agents, now banned from making offers of commission to each other on private Realtor-only databases, are not adapting to the intent of the settlement. Rather than encouraging buyers to now negotiate rates on their own, they continue to press sellers to offer commissions of 5% 6%, and then discuss commission splits among themselves.\n\nThose commission splits are largely happening the old-fashioned way: phone, email and text. In one TikTok video viewed by The New York Times, a real estate coach in Virginia with 60,000 followers, trains her viewers on how to build a landing page for each of her listings that sends automated messages to buyers\u2019 agents informing them of the commission they will receive if they bring a buyer.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n\u201cIt only took a matter of weeks really, for most agents to find a loophole. It\u2019s almost a joke,\u201d said Nick Aufenkamp, a Realtor in Washington who started a coaching business, DIY Homebuyer Academy, after the settlement to help buyers learn how to represent themselves in real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to see any change in this industry,\u201d Aufenkamp said. He estimates he has coached 30 clients who wanted to represent themselves in a home purchase and ran into a wall.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe National Association of Realtors \u201cis resolutely opposed to any attempt to circumvent the settlement,\u201d said a spokesperson, Troy Green, who added that any attempts from agents to influence buyers\u2019 or sellers\u2019 decisions in order to gain more commission \u201cis unequivocally not something that NAR condones.\u201d The organization has a fact sheet on its website explaining that steering is a violation of their code of ethics.\n\nBut Green added that the settlement \u201cexpressly allows\u201d agents to communicate offers of commission between each other on venues outside of the MLS databases.\n\nAnd there lies the rub, said Doug Miller, a Minnesota lawyer who five years ago brought one of the first lawsuits over inflated commissions to Cohen Milstein, a Chicago law firm.\n\n\u201cThe NAR settlement solves MLS steering. It did not solve steering,\u201d he said. \u201cSharing is caring. Unless you\u2019re a Realtor, and then it\u2019s collusion.\u201d\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nSome agents have turned to the legislative process to protect commission sharing. A few months after NAR lost its lawsuit, Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Rosino, a former broker, co-sponsored a bill requiring agents on both sides of a transaction to share their fees in writing. With the support of Oklahoma\u2019s influential Realtor association, that bill passed, and went into effect, in May.\n\nThe New York Times interviewed 15 buyers and sellers across the country, from Colorado to Ohio to Arizona and beyond, who said they were blocked out of the market when they tried to negotiate commissions, or navigate transactions without a real estate agent.\n\nIn Boulder, Chambers\u2019 home listing caught the eye of a local real estate agent, Lindsay Alfano. Alfano, 25, has been an agent for two years. She said Chambers had promised to pay a buyer\u2019s agent commission, and she told fellow agents at her brokerage, eXp, that she was planning to show the house to her buyers.\n\nShe received text messages mocking her and encouraging her to change course. The Times reviewed the messages.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working for free,\u201d one colleague said.\n\n\u201cSell your own listings,\u201d another wrote. \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nAlfano described her peers\u2019 reaction as eye-opening. \u201cThe amount of people that were so scared of this guy having access to what we do was a rude awakening for me,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe word is steering. If you\u2019re worried how much you\u2019re going to get paid based on the home that your client loves, you\u2019re doing it for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nChambers found a buyer in early March and his home is now under contract. He is now focused, he said, on building a new company that he says \u201cwill disrupt the real estate industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to pay someone for their services, of course, but I don\u2019t want to just light money on fire because there\u2019s a system that\u2019s forcing me to,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nQ.Our next door neighbors recently installed a Mitsubishi heat pump system. We love the idea of heat pumps and have strongly considered installing one ourselves. However, our sleep at night and peace during the day have been destroyed ever since they started using their heat pump. Our house is getting hit with heavy, low frequency sound/vibrations. It sounds like a train or giant truck idling beside one\u2019s ear and sometimes the sound waves seem to harmonize to such a point that a long, almost groaning, vibratory pulse is heard and felt. The owners themselves do not seem to be effected, but the three fan/compressor units all face our house directly and everything is built on rock here. We suspect that the sound and vibrations are being transferred through the rock and resonating with our own home construction materials. Certain weather and atmospheric conditions seem to amplify and significantly worsen the sound. Have you heard of or experienced this issue and, if so, do you have any suggestions?\n\n\u2014\u00a0MICHELLE\n\nA.This is a tough one. There are a lot of opinions out there given that conditions vary from installation to installation. We have not encountered this problem yet. A few suggestions:\n\nSince many low-frequency noises are associated with vibrations, the easiest first pass would be to ask your neighbors to place vibration-dampening pads under the unit. That could help somewhat.\n\nOur HVAC company said that it is possible to have the fan blades changed to a more aerodynamic model/material. This is the most likely culprit, but is likely to be a costly fix.\n\nAnother option is to have a roof built over the units. We have done that before in certain instances, given that these heat pumps need to be kept clear of snow in the winter to operate properly. Your neighbors could insulate the roof frame with sound-deadening insulation like rock wool. If so, this could mitigate some of the low-frequency noise.\n\nQ.We have a wood stove inserted into our fireplace. We were told to have our chimney cleaned every four cords of wood. That is very different from your advice (How often should you have your chimney swept?, Jan. 19). Also my husband was diagnosed with a pulmonary disorder, so we are being more conscious of particulates in the air that would irritate his lungs. What are your thoughts on both of these?\n\n\u2014 SARAH\n\nA.I would not advise waiting until you burn four full cords of wood to clean your chimney. Especially if there is some soft woods like pine or spruce mixed in with your hardwoods. Soft woods leave far more creosote buildup than hardwoods like oak and maple. One of the reasons we suggest yearly cleaning for people who burn wood regularly is because it gets a professional\u2019s eye on your whole chimney. They clean it, inspect for animal infiltration, check the masonry, etc. It\u2019s like having a quality mechanic regularly looking under the hood of your car.\n\nGiven that a family member has pulmonary concerns, I think you should be extra vigilant. The smoke from wood-burning fires is particularly hazardous if not contained. It may seem natural and nontoxic, but the particulates emitted can get deep into the lungs.\n\nSomething to consider is an exhaust fan at the top of the chimney that mechanically draws the smoke up through the flue. We have used them when we were worried about how well a chimney would draft. Another less expensive option would be to have an air cleaner in the room taking care of any smoke that may escape from the smoke chamber.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nWant to park in the heart of Beacon Hill? It\u2019ll cost you \u2014 $750,000, to be exact.\nA coveted spot in the Brimmer Street Garage is now up for sale, offering a rare chance to own a piece of prime city real estate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pure luxury purchase,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, the senior vice president of Cabot and Company, the listing agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. It\u2019s not like everyone can go shopping at Hermes or take private jet travel.\u201d\n\u201cBut I get it though, because it is outrageous to a certain extent,\u201d Rodriguez continued. \u201cBut, if you have the money to do it, it\u2019s very convenient.\u201d\nLast year, thegarage had three to four transfers, with the highest-priced spot selling for around $565,000. However, several transfers were for only $1 because they were tacked onto a house sale, making it difficult to determine their market value.\nOften, owners sell the spaces privately, so when they do go to market, \u201cthey always create a splash,\u201d said Rodriguez.\nRodriguez said that private transactions sometimes leave money on the table. In this case, the sellers of the parking spot decided to see what they could get on the market.\nMany of the homes on Beacon Hill lack parking spaces, leaving residents with few options for covered, off-street parking, creating a competitive market.\nThe price of parking at the Brimmer Street garage has consistently increased year over year. Rodriguez said the spots first came on the market in the 1970s, and they were going for $7,500 per spot.\n\u201cBut a lot has changed since then,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nHousing prices have also dramatically increased, with many places going for millions \u2014 often without parking.\nRodriguez noted that at those costs, what\u2019s another $750,000 for the convenience of having a parking spot? Plus, it would increase the home\u2019s resale value.\nThe buyer does get some perks. In addition to being a place to park a car, the parking is all valet, it has a filling and charging station, and attended staff can wash the car.\nBut there are ongoing costs beyond buying the deeded spot itself. HOA fees apply, and because the spots are categorized as individual condominiums, they incur additional taxes. Altogether, Rodriguez said it\u2019s about $900 a month.\nBut if you\u2019re not lucky enough to snag a spot at the Brimmer Street Garage, there are the LAZ Charles Street Garage and the Boston Common garages nearby. But both are public, with no valet, and you\u2019ve got to compete with other drivers for limited spaces.\nOr, one can look for street parking.\nEither way, \u201cthe Brimmer Street garage is in a better location,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more exclusive, private parking situation.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

The city and the soccer team dispute those claims, and so far two judges have ruled in their favor, including one that has allowed demolition to proceed ahead of the start of the trial on Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. That case could determine the fate of the $200 million White Stadium project.Related: On eve of White Stadium legal battle, judge\u2019s ruling deals significant blow to plaintiffs\u2019 hopes of stopping projectAdvertisementThe conservancy\u2019s legal campaign has confounded many in Boston\u2019s civic and nonprofit worlds. Since its founding nearly three decades ago, the group has worked closely with City Hall to maintain parkland, a partnership that allows the nonprofit to use the city-owned James Michael Curley mansion on the Jamaicaway as its headquarters for $1 a year. Now they\u2019re at war.\u201cI just feel the conservancy has lost its way,\u201d said Julie Crockford, who served as its president from 2007 to 2015 and notes the organization \u201ccan\u2019t mow a blade of grass\u201d without the city\u2019s permission. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the attitude over the fight. ... I think the voice of cooperation and behind-the-scenes negotiation would have been a stronger hand.\u201dDemolition is underway in preparation for a $200 million redevelopment of White Stadium in Franklin Park.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeThat\u2019s typically how nonprofit parks organizations operate. They don\u2019t always see eye to eye with City Hall and may even find themselves on the opposite sides of an issue, but to sue represents an \u201cextreme choice\u201d that risks irreparable damage to the relationship, said Liz Vizza, who recently retired as the longtime president of the Friends of the Public Garden.AdvertisementIn 2016, Vizza was locked in a similarly fierce battle with the city and then-Mayor Marty Walsh over a plan to change state law to allow a proposed skyscraper at the city-owned Winthrop Square Garage, which would cast shadows across Boston Common and the Public Garden.Related: White Stadium project opponents pitch a scaled-down, cheaper alternativeIn that instance, Friends of the Public Garden did not choose to sue but rather duked it out in the court of public opinion. And even though Walsh got his way \u2014 today the 691-foot Winthrop Center by Millennium Partners soars over the Financial District \u2014 Vizza still believes it was the right decision. (Walsh set aside millions of dollars from the sale of the Winthrop garage to invest in the Common and Franklin Park.)\u201cWe knew that if we sued the city ... it would take a generation or more to reestablish a relationship that is vital to working on behalf of these parks,\u201d Vizza said. \u201cSuing would be an extreme choice that we didn\u2019t make because it would have wrecked the relationship.\u201dLeaders of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, which has never before sued the city, say they did not make this decision lightly, but they felt it was necessary.\u201cWe see this as part of our mission in a way to protect the park,\u201d said Ben Taylor, the conservancy\u2019s longtime chairman and a former publisher of The Boston Globe whose family owned the newspaper for more than a century. \u201cBuilding a professional soccer stadium in Franklin Park is not protecting the park.\u201dRelated: White Stadium project cost has doubled from previous estimates, with city on hook for $91 millionThe conservancy was founded in 1998, conceived to help prevent the kind of flooding of the Muddy River that devastated Kenmore Square in the late 1990s. Since then, it has grown in both staff and scope, helping care for more than 7,000 trees, picking up trash in the parks, sponsoring concerts and artwork, and advocating for parks funding at both the city and state levels. AdvertisementWhile Franklin Park Coalition, a different nonprofit that advocates for Franklin Park and works closely with the conservancy, negotiated with the city for months over concessions for White Stadium, the conservancy seemed intent on throwing up roadblocks, said coalition president Rickie Thompson.The city-owned James Michael Curley House in Jamaica Plain is the headquarters of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeHis coalition had concerns over game-day parking and stadium maintenance but hashed things out with the city and ultimately decided to support the project by the time the city signed a lease with the soccer team in December. (Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has been part of the investor group behind the soccer team but announced last month she is withdrawing from it).With the team aiming to play in 2026, Thompson saw the conservancy\u2019s litigation strategy as a delay tactic tantamount to \u201ckilling the project\u201d and says Boston student-athletes will be the losers.\u201cIt would be fine to slow it down if you had all the time in the world,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI ran track in high school in White Stadium over 50 years ago, and that stadium has been deteriorating ever since. So we\u2019ve been waiting for 50 years. How much do you want to slow it down? 100 years?\u201dThe first whiff of legal trouble came in January 2024, when the conservancy sent a five-page comment letter to the Boston Landmarks Commission as part of the project review process. The letter, as one City Hall aide put it, \u201cwas written by a lawyer.\u201dAdvertisementCity officials immediately convened a series of meetings with Taylor and conservancy president Karen Mauney-Brodek. There was even a sit down with Wu in her fifth-floor office. The city only learned it was being sued when Globe columnist Adrian Walker called for comment a few weeks later, in February 2024.\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Wu said.Rickie Thompson, president of the Franklin Park Coalition, photographed in 2022.Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffBut looking back, the mayor remembers that meeting in her office with conservancy leaders, and feeling like, even at that early stage, the group didn\u2019t want to engage about solutions to their stated concerns.\u201cIt just felt like they were meeting to check a box,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were trying to work through all of the different concerns that they might have, and I was really in listening mode at that point. The project was very much a concept.\u201dWu said she has found the conservancy\u2019s stance \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d and that \u201cwe have not and still are not all at the table together.\u201dOne of the driving forces behind the lawsuit is Mauney-Brodek, who has been president of the conservancy since 2016 after working in the parks departments in San Francisco and New York City.Related: BOS Nation doesn\u2019t want to feel like \u2018the baby sister.\u2019 That\u2019s why the team won\u2019t play with the men in Everett. | Shirley LeungWe met up Friday, walking the perimeter of White Stadium as bulldozers whirred and beeped while prepping the grounds for construction. She showed me the young oak trees the conservancy planted nearby and defended the group\u2019s legal action.\u201cThis is not something just to sit back and watch,\u201d Mauney-Brodek said. \u201cWe repeatedly spoke with the Parks Department, wrote letters, met with them, reached out, attempted to find other resolutions. The city had no other ways to go forward.\u201dAdvertisementAnd if anyone feels blindsided, she said, it is the conservancy. When the city, conservancy, and other stakeholders worked on a Franklin Park Action Plan in 2022, the idea of a professional soccer stadium never came up.So far the law has been on the city\u2019s side. Still, Mauney-Brodek is hoping to prevail at the trial.\u201cThis is about the park, and this is about these protections that matter for the city of Boston, for this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and all of the parks they\u2019re in,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is public land, and that\u2019s the fundamental question here.\u201dOn Tuesday, a judge will begin the process of determining who is right and who is wrong. The lawsuit should be resolved in a week or two. But the divide this case has opened between the city and a parks group could last a lot longer than that.Demolition is underway at White Stadium even as a trial begins Tuesday on a lawsuit challenging the project.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeShirley Leung is a Business columnist.

His father funded High Point State Park and helped birth Fox Film, while his grandfather launched Prudential Insurance and served as a US senator.\nKuser, a Princeton grad, made his own mark pushing the eastern goldfinch as New Jersey\u2019s state bird in 1935 \u2014 a win that had senators mocking with fake chirps, per The Ridgewood News.\nAshley Christus of Turpin Real Estate holds the listing.\n\u201cDenbrooke is a timeless gem,\u201d Christus said. \u201cOver the years, it has been the cherished backdrop for family weddings, graduation parties and intimate gatherings alike.\u201d\nSet on 6.6 acres, the home, in Somerset Hills, has been professionally landscaped to include a deer fence, mature specimen trees, expansive level lawns, a perennial garden and an oval swimming pool, the listing notes. Three finished levels house the bedrooms, seven full baths and three powder rooms.\nBut behind the mansion\u2019s grand doors, Astor\u2019s life was crumbling.\nMarried at 17, she later revealed in her memoir \u201cFootprints\u201d about a marriage riddled with booze, alleged affairs and abuse that left her crying herself to sleep.\nAstor toughed it out long enough to oversee a glam overhaul by A-list architect Albert Musgrave Hyde, but by 1930, she was done \u2014 grabbing their son Anthony and filing for divorce in a split that exploded across headlines nationwide.\nKuser\u2019s political career tanked after losing a reelection bid in 1935, and he faded into obscurity, dying in 1964.\nAstor, however, bounced back, marrying Vincent Astor, inheriting a fortune, and becoming a philanthropy juggernaut, earning a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998 before passing away at 105 in 2007.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "As the saying goes, a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money \u2014 and real estate.\nMore than 13% of the country\u2019s real estate assets are owned by the wealthiest 1% of Americans \u2014\u00a0a circumstance that significantly enriched the well-heeled over the past two years of sky-high rates and housing shortages. The 1% has been so enriched, a recent Redfin analysis revealed, that their combined wealth could now feasibly purchase almost every home in the nation.\nThe analysis further concluded that the top 0.1% alone could purchase every single home in the country\u2019s 25 most populated metro areas, from New York City to San Antonio.\n\u201cIt is a striking example of the concentration of wealth in America that the top 1% could hypothetically afford to buy every home in the country \u2014 without going into debt \u2014 while millions of households struggle to buy or hold onto just one,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s economics research lead, in the report.\nThis stark disparity comes at a time when an outsized percentage of Americans believe that homeownership is no longer a realistic milestone.\nTo gain entry into the 1% club, according to the Federal Reserve, a minimum net worth of $11.2 million is required. An estimated 1.3 million American households claim membership, and their combined net worth totals $49.2 trillion. Real estate helps put this gargantuan number into perspective \u2014 the combined value of 100 million US homes is $49.7 trillion.\nIt\u2019s these two eye-popping measures upon which Redfin based its report, using Federal Reserve data and the estimated value of 98 million US properties. While net worth and aggregate home values are not directly related, the Redfin analysis demonstrated how the two measures have pretty much tracked together for the last 20 years.\nAccording to Redfin, aggregate home values exceeded the 1%\u2019s collective wealth from 2000 until the housing and global financial crisis of 2008. The wealth of the top 1% surpassed home values through the 2010s until a steep drop-off after 2020, when the market disruption of COVID-19 hit the heavily invested portfolios of the rich.\nBut America\u2019s fat cats have clawed their way back. The richest 0.1% of Americans grew their wealth by $4.4 trillion, or 25%, in just two years, Redfin reported.\nIf the 0.1% pooled only that $4.4 trillion earned between 2022 and 2024, they could buy every home in the Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Houston metro areas, according to Redfin. Their two-year gains exceed the combined wealth of America\u2019s bottom 50%.\nAsset growth has long outpaced wage growth, which makes real estate one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Almost half of the bottom 50% of Americans\u2019 net worth is tied up in real estate. And while the assets of the 1% dwarf those of the bottom 50%, the latter group claims the highest total mortgage debt at $3.1 trillion, Redfin reported.\nThe analysis adds credence to the frustration of everyday Americans, already discouraged by a real estate market in which the median listing price haslong surpassed $400,000. The median age for first-time buyers is 38 \u2014the oldest on record.\nAdvertisement",

(Of course, there are commercial offerings \u2014 such as condominium buildings \u2014 and other investment sales now listed in the portal that are larger in size.)\nThe discount buzz comes hot on the heels of another posh property,973 Fifth Ave., finally snagging a buyer last month after four years for sale.\nAdam Modlin of the Modlin Group, the broker who nabbed the buyer for that pending sale, now reps the Woolworth pad. He\u2019s crowing that it\u2019s the \u201cbest value\u201d for a place this massive, clocking in at about $2,500 a square foot.\nLucille Roberts, the force behind a women-only gym empire, and her real estate hotshot hubby Bob bought the place for $6 million in 1995 from the Young Men\u2019s Philanthropic League.\nThey poured years into sprucing it up before Lucille passed away in 2003.\nTheir family tried selling it in 2011 for that sky-high $90 million \u2014 hoping to smash townhouse sale records \u2014 but no dice.\nTwo years later, they yanked it off the market after a disgruntled ex-employee of Lucille\u2019s gyms allegedly went rogue, splattering white paint and firing BB pellets at the facade in 2012.\nKevin Roberts, the couple\u2019s son, previously told the Wall Street Journal he bunked there with his dad until 2016. Bob eventually left Manhattan for the Hamptons and Palm Beach, leaving the property to rake in $80,000 a month from a deep-pocketed renter in 2021.\nThe offering, designed by architect C.P.H. Gilbert in 1915 for retail titan Frank Woolworth\u2019s daughter Helena has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, three kitchens \u2014 plus a gym, a library, a sauna and a solarium. Other touches include mosaic tiles, stained glass and a dining room that could host a small army.\nWoolworth, the \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d king, originally built it as part of a family compound \u2014 two other homes for his kids once stood nearby until their deaths in\u00a01920s.

The buyer remains anonymous, hidden behind a shell company \u2014 for now.\nRobert A.M. Stern famously designed the limestone building. But his firm also designed the penthouse, a source said. And the new buyer is hoping that the same team can \u201crefresh\u201d the penthouse to keep it exactly the same, the source added.\nThe sale comes as Kogan is butting heads with Putin over ownership of the Domodedovo airport.\nIn January, Russian news outlet\u00a0Vedomosti\u00a0reported that Russian prosecutorsfiled a caseagainst Kogan and Dmitry Kamenshchik, claiming they failed to renationalize the holding company that manages the facility.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Russian government tried to take back control of the airport, which was privatized in 1997. In Russia, it\u2019s illegal for foreign entities to control assets deemed to be strategic to national security.\nWhen it first hit the market for $65 million in 2023, the 15 Central Park West listing included a one-bedroom and a studio in the building. They are now slated to sell separately for less than $5 million, sources said.\nFor its part, the 40th-floor penthouse is a sprawling 5,398 square feet. It comes with four bedrooms, an elaborate home office that doubles as a screening room and 3\u00bd bathrooms.\u00a0Extravagant details include a giant malachite stone fireplace and large onyx tables, as well as a stained-glass door. There\u2019s also plenty of carved wood, custom floors and high-end finishes \u2014 not to mention a chef\u2019s kitchen and dazzling city views.\nKogan also recently sold his 7-acre Greenwich, Conn., estate for $10.4 million,as Gimme Shelter previously reported.\nHowever, his palatial pad at the Plaza Hotel \u2014 that comes with a castle-like turret \u2014 is still on the market. Since February, the\u00a0condo has been asking $23 million \u2014 down from the original $50 million ask, as Gimme also noted.\nAn additional one-bedroom apartment in the Plaza across the hall, No. 1008, is asking under $3 million. The listing broker for both apartments is Compass\u2019s Charlie Attias.\nThe Kogans also sold a penthouse in Israel for $33 million and a condo at 515 Park Ave. for $14.5 million, which had first listed for $25 million.\u00a0In addition, they have another home in Israel that first listed for $259 million and is now asking a dramatically less $89 million, according to reports.\nThe listing broker for the 15 Central Park West penthouse, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Adam Rothman, declined to comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Thousands of drivers whiz by the vacant brick building perched precariously over the Mystic River every day without giving it a second thought. But city officials in Everett and Boston have been giving this former sewage pumphouse a lot of thought lately, as they eye it for potential restoration and redevelopment amid the broader rebirth underway around the Encore Boston Harbor casino across the street.Although it\u2019s on the Everett side of the river, the 15,000-square-foot pumphouse actually sits within a tiny sliver of Boston that extends along Alford Street (Route 99). Consultants are about to finish studying the feasibility of redoing the 19th-century building, as soon as this month, on behalf of the cities of Everett and Boston, and funded by state gaming commission funds.Ideas have ranged from turning it into a community center, to a kayak and canoe launch, to a beer hall. The leading concept, though, seems to be a ferry terminal, in part because the Kraft Group is eyeing the site next door to build a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution.\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about it,\u201d said Patrick Herron, executive director of the Mystic River Watershed Association. \u201cWhat a way to breathe life into a historic building on the edge of the water.\u201dAdvertisementKathy Abbott, chief executive of the nonprofit Boston Harbor Now, said the site is an ideal location for a ferry terminal because it\u2019s on the Boston Harbor side of the Alford Street bridge, whose low height prevents many commercial boats from passing under it. (Casino owner Wynn Resorts commissioned ferries purpose-built to fit under the bridge to serve casino customers.)While a boat landing could help with game-day transit for pro soccer games, Abbott said any terminal\u2019s full potential would depend on whether other public transportation projects proposed for the area come to fruition, such as a Silver Line bus-rapid-transit extension or a new commuter rail stop next to the casino.The conversations around the pumphouse, currently owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, started a few years ago, long before state lawmakers approved legislation in November that rezones the adjacent site for a soccer stadium. That legislation removes the site next door, home to a shuttered power plant, from what\u2019s known as a Designated Port Area, where only marine industrial uses can be developed.AdvertisementHowever, per state officials, the legislation left the pumphouse property in the DPA. That could pose a challenge to any redevelopment of the site, although a ferry terminal would be an allowed use within the zone. Other challenges include the limited space for parking and a dilapidated seawall that needs to be shored up.Herron said he expects state regulators would be willing to remove the site from the DPA because it\u2019s not currently home to industrial use. (The MWRA stopped pumping at the facility in 1993, replacing it with a more modern facility across the street, though an active sewer pipe passes under one portion of the 1890s building.)Everett and Boston officials are also engaged in discussions about a harborwalk extension that would bring the path along the Mystic River from the casino across the street, under the Alford Street bridge, and around the pumphouse to the stadium site.Tom Philbin, an environmental planner with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria\u2019s administration, said Massachusetts Gaming Commission grants have so far provided nearly $250,000 to design the 1,500-foot harborwalk extension and around $200,000 to study the feasibility of restoring the pumphouse. (The money comes out of community mitigation funds overseen by the gaming commission for casino host cities and nearby communities.)In a preliminary community agreement signed with DeMaria in late 2023, the Kraft Group agreed to pay for completing the harborwalk extension from the casino to the soccer stadium site. However, the Revs and Patriots ownership is not currently involved in the talks around the pumphouse\u2019s future.AdvertisementStacy Thompson, interim executive director at Historic Boston, the primary consultant studying the pumphouse\u2019s viability, said the restoration hinges on the eventual price tag. But she remains hopeful that the pumphouse could become an important piece in the broader mosaic of this new urban neighborhood gradually taking shape. At this time, any final decision on the building\u2019s fate would ultimately be up to the MWRA.\u201cThere\u2019s so much potential,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cCould it be a ferry station or a landing point? Yes. Could it be something else that serves the community? Yes. We\u2019re not there yet [but] we\u2019re getting closer to understanding what\u2019s possible.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

        "content": "This California listing sure \u201cangled\u201d its way into an all-out bidding war.\nA midcentury-modern home in the Berkeley Hills outside of San Francisco \u2014 and one designed by the locally prominent architect John Hans Ostwald \u2014 has sold for $1.6 million, marking a breathtaking increase that was more than double the listing\u2019s asking price.\nWhat\u2019s more, the striking hexagonal residence, which asked $795,000 for sale, only spent two weeks on the market, The Post has learned.\nListed on Feb. 6, the property went into contract 14 days later, fetching 101% over the list price in a frenzy of buyer interest that saw more than 30 offers, 70 private showings, 300 inquiries and more than 1,000 visitors swarm its open houses.\nNeedless to say, the home\u2019s explosive demand caught listing agent, Jodi Nishimura of Kai Real Estate, off guard.\n\u201cWe knew that the [midcentury-modern] vibe and hexagon shape of the home would be interesting, but did not expect as many people to be drawn to the home,\u201d she told The Post.\nThe listing kicked off with a brokers\u2019 tour on Feb. 5, followed by a late-day open house where \u201cpeople were in awe at the incredible sunset during the twilight hours.\u201d\nBy the weekend, the Saturday open house burned through 100 brochures in just two and a half hours, while Sunday saw an unrelenting stream of visitors.\n\u201cOne of our open houses counted over 300 people,\u201d Nishimura said.\nPriced as a \u201cteaser\u201d in a competitive East Bay market, the home\u2019s allure among many prospective buyers stemmed from a perfect storm of factors, with Nishimura citing the ask, its design, its location and market conditions.\nThis architectural treasure, named the Foley House, was commissioned in 1963 by a dental hygienist who remained its sole owner until her recent passing.\nSpanning 1,300 square feet, the two-bedroom, two-bathroom residence boasts panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County, all framed by its distinctive geometric design and pristine original features.\nExposed redwood rafters, refinished oak floors, a copper fireplace, and period details like grass cloth wallpaper and bubble lampshades have been meticulously preserved since its construction more than six decades ago.\nOstwald, a Berlin-born architect who transitioned from law to design, left his mark on the Bay Area with his Swiss-inspired functional aesthetic. Known for blending homes seamlessly with their natural surroundings, he collaborated with California luminaries like Richard Neutra, while also designing local landmarks such as the Bancroft Center and St. John\u2019s Presbyterian Church.\n\u201cWhat dental hygienist can commission a home in Berkeley in this era?\u201d Nishimura quipped, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare property. There are a bunch of [midcentury] homes in the area but this is one of the most unique.\u201d\nAnd it was a lure for many.\nThe buyer pool ranged widely, from \u201cyoung professionals who are enamored with [midcentury] architecture\u201d to architects and designers of all ages.\nThe winning bidder, who offered $1.6 million, had a personal connection to Ostwald\u2019s work.\n\u201cThe buyer fell in love with the architect by visiting a friend\u2019s home designed by the same architect, so when this became available they really wanted [it],\u201d Nishimura said.\nThe Berkeley Hills location didn\u2019t hurt either, with neighbors like Robert Reich, the journalist Michael Pollan, and director Michael Lewis adding a touch of star power to the community.\nAll this said, and as for the broader market, Nishimura sees a resurgence.\n\u201cThe luxury market in San Francisco is coming back strong. And top neighborhoods in the East Bay are doing very well,\u201d she said. \u201cThere continues to be such a dearth of inventory and this is such a desirable place to live that competition remains fierce for the best homes.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

But he\u2019s best known for creating the \u201cvertically integrated\u201d system, in which all powerful studios owned the talent (actors, writers, producers) \u2014 as well as the distribution network and theaters that exhibited the films.\nZukor also once owned more than 300 acres in Rockland County, New York, including this farmhouse that was built in the 1930s and expanded in 1944, said listing broker Richard Ellis of Ellis Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nKnown as Mountain View Farmhouse, the six-bedroom, 4\u00bd-bathroom home is located at 374 South Mountain Road in New City, NY, and sits on 6.7 acres.\nZukor once invited guests such as Mick Jagger to attend screenings on the larger estate.\nOther guests at screenings included sculptor John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, architect/painter Henry Varnum Poor \u2014 and composer\u00a0Kurt Weill and his wife, the Tony Award-winning actress/singer Lotte Lenya.\nThe sellers bought the home for $944,000 in 2017. It then underwent an $800,000 renovation in 2019. The current owner, who declined to be named, called it a \u201cpeaceful country escape with the most amazing beech trees, magnolia, ducks, herons and egrets visiting the pond, just 30 minutes from Manhattan.\u201d\nAt 4,740 square feet, the residence opens to a great room with glass walls. An open chef\u2019s kitchen leads to a large slate patio that runs along the back of the house.\nThe main bedroom suite is on the first floor with an adjacent den; additional bedrooms are on the second level. There\u2019s also a guest suite above the garage.\nDesign details include hand-hewn beams, interior sandstone and brick walls, leaded glass windows, panel doors, 12-foot ceilings and two fireplaces. Outside, there\u2019s a pond, a tennis court, a basketball court and grass lawns with magnolias, dogwood, weeping beech trees and more.\nThe home is also close to High Tor State Park, a 691-acre area with hiking trails and views of the New York City skyline.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Say goodbye to the days of snagging a cheap starter home in South Florida. That ship has sailed, and it\u2019s been replaced by a yacht for millionaires.\nBack in the day \u2014 particularly five years ago in the early days of COVID-19 \u2014 $1.1 million got buyers a fancy house and a spot among the top dogs. Now, they need $2.6 million just to keep up, and even that won\u2019t buy much. The little guy\u2019s dream of owning a home down there is pretty much kaput.\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 and they\u2019re brutal.\nIn Palm Beach County, 24% of houses sold last year went for $1 million or more, according a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. Miami-Dade is close behind at 23%.\nThings are speeding up, too. Long-affluent Palm Beach had a 56% jump in million-dollar sales this past December, the biggest spike since May 2021. TheMiami Association of Realtorssays high-end homes are taking over the market, and there\u2019s no stopping it.\n\u201cSouth Florida still doesn\u2019t have enough inventory to meet demand,\u201d says Eddie Blanco, the 2025 Miami Chairman, in the report. \u201cWealth migration to Miami remains high. Buyers from high-taxed, high-density states continue to move here for our jobs, weather and lifestyle.\u201d\nCash rules everything around here \u2014 West Palm Beach was No. 1 in the US last year with 49.6% of sales paid in full upfront, while Fort Lauderdale and Miami hit a respective 38.9% and 38.1%, according to ATTOM.\nThat\u2019s great if you\u2019re loaded, but if you\u2019re stuck with a mortgage and languishing high interest rates, good luck.\nCheck out January 2025: Miami-Dade\u2019s $1 million-plus house sales went up 3.1% to 164 deals, and the middle price for those homes jumped 7.1% to $675,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a jaw-dropping 184.2% more than it was in January 2015.\nCondos aren\u2019t cheap either \u2014 their middle price crept up 2.3% to $415,000, nearly 120% higher than a decade ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the spring market off to a healthy start, with sales and prices broadly up from one year ago,\u201d says Miami Realtors chief economist Gay Cororaton in a report. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving the market is the upper price tier, with strong growth in the $600,000 and over and million-dollar market.\u201d\nFor the super-rich, it\u2019s a feeding frenzy.\nIn Miami-Dade, the price for a top 5% house shot up 22% in 2024 to $3.3 million, and the top 1% \u201cultra-fancy\u201d ones hit $10 million, a 38% jump, perMiami MLS data.\nCondo prices for the big spenders climbed too \u2014 $2.3 million for the top 5% and $6.3 million for the top 1%. Golden Beach is king with a middle million-dollar price of $8.7 million, followed by spots like Bal Harbour ($3.1 million) and Pinecrest ($2.6 million).\nBut starter homes? They\u2019re history.\nSure, some cheaper condos are selling\u2014$200,000 to $250,000 ones went up 10.3% to 75 sales, and $400,000 to $600,000 ones rose 4.7% to 178 in January 2025. But with barely any homes to buy \u2014 inventory\u2019s down 9.9% from normal, and condo listings are 27.3% below pre-COVID days \u2014 it\u2019s slim pickings.\nFlorida\u2019s trying to help with a law pushing developers to build affordable homes, but it\u2019s not enough when the wealthy keep pouring in.\nBottom line: South Florida\u2019s a millionaire\u2019s paradise now. They\u2019re scooping up huge homes with cash while average Americans are having trouble getting their foot in the door. With home equity gains almost double the national average \u2014 $542,175 in Miami-Dade from 2009 to 2024 compared to $310,232 nationwide \u2014 becoming a homeowner there is growing increasingly difficult.\nAdvertisement",

I\u2019d better at least mention it.\u2019\u201d\nThe deal paid off \u2014 literally.\nThe property rents for $272 an hour through Peerspace, with a six-hour minimum, though Thoy kept mum on exactly how much Netflix shelled out.\nDuring filming, the production crew relocated her family to a bare-bones rental, but Thoy and one of her sons couldn\u2019t resist sneaking back to watch their home morph into the Webb family\u2019s base.\nA bonus perk is when the crew built a shed in the garden \u2014 where Paapa Essiedu\u2019s character Elmore Fitch meets his grisly end \u2014 and left it behind. Her son now uses it for music and gym gear, freeing up her garden room.\nThe house\u2019s history adds another layer of charm.\nHistorian Melanie Backe-Hansen uncovered that it was built for William Morris, a retired surgeon who lived there with two servants until his death at 66. His sisters took over next, followed by a string of residents, including naval captain Halton Stirling Lecky in 1939.\nOnce surrounded by countryside, the mansion\u2019s views have since been gobbled up by London\u2019s sprawl.\nListed withMark Breffitof Hamptons Estate Agents, the nearly 6,000-square-foot gem features a gravel terrace with outdoor dining and a grassy lawn framed by plant borders.\n\u201cWith its gated entrance, off-street parking and an expansive south-facing garden, this property offers a rare combination of privacy and space in the city,\u201d Breffit said in a statement.\n\u201cAnd for those who appreciate a touch of glamour, the house\u2019s starring role in a popular Netflix show adds an intriguing element to its already impressive pedigree.\u201d Breffit said in statement.\nBut despite its star turn and her family\u2019s affection, Thoy is ready to downsize now that her kids have flown the nest, adding that her family loved living in the neighborhood \u2014 but that the house got too big for just her and her husband.\nAdvertisement",

Its cabanas once hosted the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Madonna, but a decade of neglect succeeded by Hurricane Irma in 2017 put an end to the hotel\u2019s heyday.\nNow, an ambitious remodel is giving the luxurious seaside getaway a second wind as Rosewood The Raleigh,theDaily Mail reported.\nThe Raleigh Hotel was built in 1940 on the cusp of Miami\u2019s post-war boom. It was heavily featured in the boundary-breaking 1996 box office hit \u201cThe Birdcage,\u201d starring Williams and Lane, as well as the recently deceasedGene Hackmanand Hank Azaria.\nThe film, based on the 1979 farcical French film \u201cLa Cage Aux Folles,\u201d follows a gay couple \u2014 portrayed by Williams and Lane \u2014 whose son is marrying into the family of a conservative senator, played by Hackman.\nThe hotel was also favored by the late Karl Lagerfeld, who premiered Chanel\u2019s resort line along the Raleigh\u2019s iconic coast-of-arms pool in 2008.\nThe hotel will once again open its doors to Miami\u2019s rich and famous thanks to the $1 billion overhaul by developer Micahel Shvo, whose SHVO company purchased the down-on-its-luck property with a group of developers in 2019.\nRenownedarchitect Peter Marinogave the 60-key hotel a refresh, and constructed a 17-story residential tower next door. The Raleigh will be managed by Rosewood Hotels, a luxury hotel and resort company.\nThe newly constructed glass tower will host 40 coveted waterfront residences. These units range in size from two to five bedrooms and will run you anywhere from $10 to $150 million, the Daily Mail reported.\nThe luxurious homes boast large terraces, stone flooring and bathrooms with refrigerators just for beauty products. The revamped hotel next door will continue to offer high-end amenities including a full spa, a fitness center and a private beach club.\nThe Rosewood collaboration marks a second chance at life for the landmarked hotel. The property was previously owned by Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s Hilfiger Hospitality, but the destruction of Hurricane Irma in 2017 closed the hotel in the midst of much-needed repairs.\nMove-in day for the residences is expected to arrive in late 2027. Shvo told the Daily Mail that \u201cmost\u201d of the residences have already sold to cash offers, with a total of $250 million in pre-sales so far.Such a high uptake would be an impressive feat amidFlorida\u2019s softening housing market, which saw a record number of unsold listings in January.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A distinctively lithe home in Central London is on the market for $1.62 million.\nAt just 7 feet wide, the pale green residence is considered the second skinniest home in London, Jam Press reported.\nIt still manages to squeeze in two bedrooms and two bathrooms across three floors, despite its diminutive size.\nWhat the home lacks in width, it makes up for with Arts and Crafts-style charm. From a dragon headed-drain pipe to a rare outdoor terrace, this compact home contains a big personality.\nThe London listing, which is held by Unique Property Company, jokes that the Kensington flat was \u201cvery much an early adopter\u201d of the tiny home trend. The brick facade was built in 1930 and underwent renovations in the 1950s.\nVisitors are immediately greeted with the kitchen and dining area, which the listing claims has a \u201cTardis-like feel\u201d thanks to high ceilings. The dining area connects to a bathroom and the first of the two bedrooms. Glazed double doors at the rear greet a \u201csliver of a garden.\u201d\nUp the narrow stairs is a cozy drawing room with exposed floorboards, a decorative fireplace and just enough space for a love seat. This floor boasts access to a roof terrace \u2014 a rarity in London that adds much-needed breathing room to the home. The listing photos show room enough for an outdoor bench, table and chairs.\nWhile $1.62 million is by no means cheap, home prices for the skinny home\u2019s Peel Street, Holland Park neighbors averaged almost $3 million in 2024, according to the UK property portal Rightmove.\nThe final floor just barely fits another petite double-bedroom and an ensuite bathroom.\nTwo other London flats are tied for the city\u2019s skinniest home, both measuring 6 feet in width. One of them, an apartment building, sold a two-bedroom flat in 2023 forjust under $1 million.\nAdvertisement",

Tuff Shed prebuilt most of the interior and the two balconies and patio. Cook\u2019s floor plan was all in her head.\n\u201cI\u2019d tell them, put the window 2 feet from the door,\u201d she says.\nThe couple, who have no formal construction training, hired professionals for the crawl space foundation, electric, plumbing, and spray foam insulation. The lot already had a well and septic tank. A builder made sure everything was up to county house code.\nThe \u201cshome\u201d (combination of \u201cshed\u201d and \u201chome\u201d) ended up with two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, two balconies, a full kitchen with a gas range and a large sunken island, laundry closet, and large patio.\nThe stylish but homey interior is Cook\u2019s vision, a look she calls \u201ca blend of farmhouse and beach house\u2014even though it\u2019s on a lake.\u201d\nWhere Cook could have gone with drywall for the ceilings and walls, she insisted on tongue and groove and shiplap.\n\u201cI did that shiplap all by myself,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt came out beautiful, but it took a long time.\u201d\nThe unfinished kitchen cabinets were stock from Lowe\u2019s that Cook painted sage green to complement the green-infused Brazilian granite countertops that she fell for despite their hefty $6,000 price tag.\n\u201cI just like what I like,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything came out the way I saw it in my head.\u201d\nCook also found vintage and Hobby Lobby pieces to jazz up the farmhouse-inspired decor (mostly bought from Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot).\nThere are also the whimsical touches such as the fish sink in one bathroom and a video arcade game in the kitchen. The floors are vinyl plank with custom carpet on the stairs and upper floors, to make them more kid-friendly.\nWhen a plumber left a drain line for the upstairs bathroom bulging from the kitchen wall, Richard improvised, building a matching sage-green birdhouse over the stove to stylishly conceal it.\nNot wanting to waste any space in the 1,296-square-foot shed, Cook added a half-bath under the stairs, along with a \u201cclubhouse\u201d for her grandkids.\nThe cost to turn a shed into a home was approximately $170,000 (minus the shell).\nThe couple lived in it for six months while carrying out the renovation. They decided to list it so they could move on to their next project: a barndominium.\nThe shed-house received many offers and was sold over the asking price at $460,000.\nEven so, Cook feels if she\u2019d waited six months, \u201cI could have gotten an extra $100,000.\u201d\nShe also believes the home was priced too low because it can be listed only as a one-bedroom, despite having two, due to the home being on a \u201cone-bedroom septic.\u201d\n\u201cThat hurt us on the appraisal,\u201d she says. However, the lake-view location definitely helped the home\u2019s popularity.\nCook admits, \u201cWe made a lot of money off it.\u201d\nSo did the buyer, whosoldit in March 2025, closing at $505,000.\nAs to whether Cook will make a career of turning sheds into swoon-worthy homes, she laughs.\n\u201cIf somebody hired me, I\u2019d probably want to. I know my husband and kids want me to.\u201d\nDaughter\u00a0Amanda McCormick, who made the TikTok reels showing off her mom\u2019s work, has bigger ideas.\n\u201cI want her to get a TV show,\u201d she says.\nAdvertisement",

That rarified access, combined with the unit\u2019s ornate 19th-century details, make this listing an extra hot commodity.\nMoreover, that price buys a prime piece of city history. The building at 34 Gramercy Park East claims the title of the oldest surviving co-op in the city, according to architectural historian Andrew Alpern. The 10-story, 45 unit residence was built in 1883 \u2014 the same year the Brooklyn Bridge opened.\n(Co-ops, as opposed to condominiums, are where buyers own shares in the building, rather than the real property of the homes themselves.)\nResidents in the Queen Anne-style building covet not only its prime location and ornate decor.\nThe apartment is in the same landmarked building where British model and actress Cara Delevingnebought Jimmy Fallon\u2019s four-unit triplexin 2022 for $10.8 million. Actor Richard Gerealso purchasedan eight-floor condo there in 2016 for $2.25 million.\nThe for-sale unit is located on the entry floor of the building, and spans around 1,900 square feet. It includes three flexible bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus a salon and kitchen. The listing, held by Lynne C. Lerner of Compass, describes the unit\u2019s \u201chistoric charm,\u201d with Gilded Age architectural details that transport residents to \u201can era of elegance and refinement.\u201d\nThe apartment\u2019s entrance speaks to the grandeur within, featuring non-original parquet flooring with an intricate, inlaid marquetry border, as well as a hand-painted Chinese wall covering. A park-facing salon includes original hardwood floors, an opulent chandelier and a marble fireplace at its focal point. Thirteen-foot ceilings span the apartment.\n\u201cYou see 13 foot ceilings in a lot of modern buildings and some loft conversions, but it\u2019s beautiful to see it in the building of this era,\u201d Lerner told The Post.\nThe lacquer-red primary suite includes a striking floor-to-ceiling chifforobe and an en-suite bath covered in green marble tiles. A second bedroom, currently used as a den, is floor-to-ceiling mahogany, featuring an original fireplace and shuttered windows with stained glass detailing.\nThe final bedroom includes yet another fireplace and even more Gilded Age details in its molding and trim.\nThe home last changed hands in 2004,whenreporter Stone Phillips, the former co-anchor of Dateline NBC, sold the unit to a man named Michael Stotsky, according to city records.\nThe lobby itself is a sight to beyond, with a Tiffany glass ceiling and mosaic tiling. Despite its opulence, 34 Gramercy Park East comes from humble origins. The red brick and terra cotta facade was constructed as a middle class alternative to tenement housing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique property, and very well preserved,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cIt kind of transports you back to 1883.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

That deal now marks the most expensive apartment ever sold downtown, narrowly beating the 2018 record set by billionaire Robert F. Smith\u2019s$59 million penthouse purchasein Chelsea.\nThis recent off-market transaction not only met the sellers\u2019 exact asking price, but also earned them double what they paid for the unit in 2016.\nThe deal was closed on Thursdaythrough a co-listing between Jim St. Andr\u00e9 of Compass and Peter Zaitzeff of Serhant. The Wall Street Journalfirst reported on the sale.\nThe 5,840-square-foot waterfront apartment boasts views of the Hudson River and a large outdoor terrace. While it\u2019s a notable deal for the downtown area, it\u2019s far from the city\u2019s \u2014 and the nation\u2019s \u2014 priciest home sale. Ken Griffin\u2019s roughly $238 million purchase of a multi-story residence inside 220 Central Park South in 2019 continues to hold both of those records.\nThis just-sold home at 150 Charles includes five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms. While little about the interiors of the unit has been advertised, the listing photos show a spacious, modern home with ample natural light and a neutral color palette.\nAn eat-in kitchen features marbled countertops and a backsplash, and a spiraling staircase adds artistic flair to the home\u2019s minimalist design.\nA Serhant promotional video for the listing from November also flaunted$500,000 parking spacesbelow the building.\nThe sellers are financier Harsh Padia, of Hap Capital Advisors, and his wife,interior designer Purvi Padia. The pair bought the apartment in 2016 from the building\u2019s developer, Alex Witkoff, for $29 million. The Padias sold the unit to an unidentified buyer.\nThis isn\u2019t Padia\u2019s first downtown sale. Harsh Padia previously owneda 5-story penthouse at 471 Washington St. that he sold in 2021 for $17.6 million, according to the city register.\nThe 15-story, full-service building at 150 Charles St. is highly coveted real estate in its historic West Village neighborhood. Witkoff opened the 91-unit building in 2013 \u2014 and A-listers includingBon Jovi, Ben Stiller,Ryan Seacrestand Irina Shayk have since called it home.\nThe full-service building includes concierge services, a gym and a private courtyard.\nAdvertisement",

Packed with cutting-edge tech, the penthouse even includes a Savant smart home system for effortless control.\nSarah Williams, the founder of Societe Real Estate, held the listing and declined to comment on the sale. Representing Hafner were Michael Duchon and Eloy Carmenate of Corcoran, who also declined to comment.\nHafner co-founded Kayak in 2004 alongside tech whiz Paul English, turning it into a go-to metasearch engine for flights, hotels, car rentals and vacation deals.\nThe platform, which first hit the web in 2005, evolved from its original name, Travel Search Company, Inc., to Kayak Software Corporation later that year.\nBefore that, Hafner cut his teeth in the travel industry by helping launch Orbitz in 1999, where he spearheaded business growth, ad sales and marketing.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Winter in New York City often enjoys a cooler real estate market, but not this year.\nRenters in Manhattan were met with record-high rents in February, with a median rent of $4,500 \u2014 a 6.4% uptick from the same time last year. Prices also rose in Brooklyn and Queens as vacancy rates tightened,a new reportfrom Douglas Elliman revealed.\nEveryone, from renters to agents, is feeling the heat.\n\u201cThe fact is, there\u2019s not a lot of room to negotiate,\u201d Douglas Wagner, BOND New York\u2019s director of brokerage services, told The Post.\nThe early bird no longer gets the worm when it comes to applications, either.\nIt\u2019s all about who can offer more, according to Laurel Ferrera, an agent at Keller Williams NYC. Units are advertising at low prices to whip up interest, Ferrera said in an email, and then taking as many applications as possible.\n\u201cA place on the Upper West Side that was initially marketed at $3,700 for a one bed, one bath ended up being rented for $800 above asking,\u201d Ferrera wrote. \u201cThe agent told me, \u2018The people who got their apartment [are] willing to go higher if needed.\u2019\u201d\nA quarter of Manhattan deals in February sparked bidding wars, the Elliman report found, also marking a record high. Experts blame the increased competition, in part, on an uncertain economy, skittish homebuyers and back-to-office mandates.\nFerrera\u2019s recent client, Alex K. \u2014 who didn\u2019t reveal her full name for privacy \u2014 thought starting her apartment search in February would give her the upper hand. She was quickly disabused of that theory.\n\u201cI\u2019d always heard that winter is a lot easier to find places,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cBut everybody just seems to want to come back to the city now.\u201d\nAlex, who is moving from California to New York for work, said she and Ferrara looked at more than a dozen apartments across Brooklyn and Manhattan. In the process, she ended up in four separate bidding wars.\nOne of the bid-upon units was a Cobble Hill one-bedroom that, Alex said, someone else paid $800 above the asking price for.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some people have dual incomes, but it\u2019s just me, and I can\u2019t compete with that,\u201d Alex said.\nThe Elliman report found February\u2019s Brooklyn listings had even fiercer competition than Manhattan, with35% of deals resulting in bidding wars.\nCompared to Manhattan and Brooklyn, housing inventory in Northwest Queens saw a generous increase. The103% uptickin available listings in February may have contributed to a higher rate of the borough\u2019s landlords willing to make concessions, eager to attract choosier tenants. Still, bidding wars were documented in a fifth of all deals in Queens.\nThe Elliman analysis also documented a faster rise in the median rent of non-doorman buildings than doorman buildings. Wagner said he has noticed renters aspiring to more outfitted, upgraded apartments, and he said they\u2019re willing to give up an amenity, like a doorman, to get those features.\n\u201cIf the non-doorman apartment is well-equipped, and there\u2019s a washer-dryer in the apartment, and the rooms are not tiny, it makes a huge difference,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cPeople will maybe give up the idea of a doorman and a health club to save a little bit of money, if they can get something better than an Easy Bake kitchen.\u201d\nIf an apartment today is equipped well and priced well, Wagner said, there will be a line out the door.\nWagner predicts an even hotter summer for the market, with prices remaining high and units staying competitive.

        "content": "Five Years Later\n\n\n\n Lessons for the next pandemic\nFive years ago this week, Boston was unrecognizable. Its normally bustling streets were deserted. Its office towers and arenas empty. Its restaurants dark. The days stretched to weeks, then months, of wondering when the people would come back.Eventually, they did.Five years after COVID shut down Boston, things feel, by and large, normal again. There are lines at lunch spots, crowds at the Garden, college kids at the bars. But the city isn\u2019t the same.Measures of foot traffic and office vacancy haven\u2019t fully rebounded. Hybrid work remains pretty common. Car traffic is worse. Empty storefronts persist.But more than anything, we just don\u2019t mix like we did before.A Northeastern University study of cellphone data found that when COVID hit, inhabitants of Greater Boston became far less likely to interact with people of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Those numbers have been recovering, but for many parts of the region, particularly in the suburbs, levels of what researchers call \u201csocial exploration\u201d have fallen sharply.\nAdvertisementAnd that\u2019s bad news for a city whose culture and economy have, for centuries, been built on people mixing, connecting, and sharing ideas, said Northeastern University physicist Esteban Moro, who\u2019s leading the study. Bad enough that it raises questions about what cities like Boston are for, now, and how we make them places that people connect once again.\u201cCities are these social engines that put together people,\u201d Moro said. \u201cThis is the purpose of the city, right?\u201dRelated: Five Years Later: Lessons for the next pandemicThese days, that engine isn\u2019t working like it used to. Moro and his colleagues at Northeastern\u2019s Social Urban Networks Group track the movement of people across cities, and when they look at Greater Boston they see, basically, less movement. Generally, people in the most affluent suburbs are staying in their affluent suburbs. People in the region\u2019s lower income corners stay there, too.It\u2019s an indicator of the diminished role that downtown plays in the daily lives of Bostonians. According to recent figures from the Downtown Boston Alliance, about 20,000 fewer people work downtown than did five years ago, and they come in, on average, about three fewer days per month. Add it up, and the work trips into the core of the city district have fallen by almost half.AdvertisementIt\u2019s the sort of challenge Boston has faced before, said Karilyn Crockett, a former city director of economic policy and research who now teaches urban planning at MIT. In the 1950s and \u201860s, as residents decamped to the suburbs and jobs followed, Boston responded by constructing skyscrapers that signaled to the world that the city was a place for doing business. It\u2019s time, Crockett said, to find a new signal.A view of the Boston skyline at morning. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\u201cThe fundamental thing that we\u2019re asking is where are people?\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is the center of gravity in the city, whether for shopping or for hanging out or for work? Where do people come together?\u201dIncreasingly, that\u2019s neighborhoods where people do more than work. While foot traffic downtown remains below pre-pandemic levels, according to city data, it\u2019s nearly back citywide, and up in places such as Fenway and Longwood. What\u2019s the difference? These \u201cmultipurpose\u201d neighborhoods, as Moro describes them, provide chances to live, work, and play in more equal measure.That\u2019s something the Wu administration is trying to do downtown, offering a generous tax break to help convert underused older office buildings into housing. Mayor Michelle Wu said the city has received applications to convert 20 buildings into 760 units of housing, 153 of which will be income restricted.Related: \u2018The lockdowns were never really effective\u2019: New research shows COVID stay-at-home orders did more harm than good\u201cEvery building that comes back to life makes a difference,\u201d Wu said.Even office buildings that aren\u2019t being converted are seeing new life.Take 63 Franklin St., an old bank headquarters in Downtown Crossing. In December, job-training nonprofit Breaktime paid $6.3 million to buy it to house their 40-plus employees, a health clinic, and retail space where the teens Breaktime works with can hold jobs \u2014 showing how a downturn in office values can open new doors for new ideas.AdvertisementThe city\u2019s trying other things too, like doling out $10 million in federal COVID relief funds to help 90 small businesses find a toehold in empty storefronts, and pushing Beacon Hill to provide 225 new liquor licenses, which it will distribute across the city to spur new restaurants in all corners of Boston.But these efforts are fighting an uphill battle.The empty floors of a downtown office building and streets below as the city of Boston emptied out on March 13, 2020.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffTakeout orders were prepared at Soleil in Roxbury in 2021. The restaurant had to turn to takeout during the pandemic. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe pandemic accelerated a shift toward online shopping that was taking hold well before COVID, and the rise of takeout \u2014 in place of restaurant meals \u2014 has persisted, too, Moro\u2019s data shows. Remote work and even hybrid arrangements mean people congregate less often downtown, for both work and play.People like Brenda Bond-Fortier, a professor in the Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University, who studies organizational change and has witnessed it herself in the wake of the pandemic.Bond-Fortier used to spend her days downtown, at Suffolk. Today, she\u2019s teaching her graduate classes online, from her home in southern New Hampshire, and ventures in just two days a week. She misses the bustle of Boston and seeing her colleagues, but she doesn\u2019t miss spending 10 hours a week in the car.\u201cI\u2019m very blessed where I have job with a bit more flexibility in terms of when I do and don\u2019t go to the city,\u201d she said.Related: Six things we got wrong about COVID-19, from washing groceries to herd immunityTo Crockett, even the word \u201cdowntown\u201d feels a bit archaic, as it implies we\u2019re all going to the same place. In this more splintered age, we aren\u2019t.Advertisement\u201cIf people are going to venture out of their home for any reason,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s to have a particular experience.\u201dAnd experience is a big part of how developers aim to draw people out now. Food halls, for instance, are springing up across the city, not just catering to office workers seeking lunch but also tourists, families, and after-hours crowds into the night.Visitors can ride a tube slide in between floor levels at the Museum of Ice Cream in the Seaport.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffA slew of for-profit \u201cInstagram museums\u201d and immersive art experiences have recently taken up residence in hollowed-out storefronts. A Harry Potter exhibit has lately drawn throngs to an empty old Best Buy at the CambridgeSide mall. \u201cCompetitive socializing\u201d is all the rage in the Seaport, where different venues offer mini-golf, ping pong, bowling, pickleball, or darts. And the recent arrival of new spaces where people can both shop and linger \u2014 be it at Beacon Hill Books & Cafe, or the batting-cage-boasting Dick\u2019s House of Sport in Back Bay \u2014 are models for how businesses can transform an errand into an event.Even small businesses are attempting to be a little bit of everything.Related: \u2018We really never came back to each other\u2019: Five years after COVID, we\u2019re more divided than everIn the wake of the pandemic, Justin Sorbo and two colleagues left their longstanding jobs at gym chain Equinox to open Pearl Street Fitness training studio in the Financial District. The gym\u2019s owner, David Cheal, purchased a former convenience store and renovated it into a boutique gym where customers can linger after workouts on tufted leather couches, sipping whiskey or getting a trim from one of the visiting barbers that pass through. His goal was to create a \u201dthird space\u201d for clients to hang out in, and to work from before or after sessions.AdvertisementAt Pearl Street Fitness, owner David Cheal works with a client. He said he wants to create a \u201dthird space\u201d for clients to hang out in, and to work from before or after sessions.\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\u201cThe entire thing is to facilitate relationship-building of different kinds and having strong bonds and connections with people,\u201d Sorbo said. \u201cNormal face-to-face interactions are something that\u2019s becoming sparse in the area of remote work. We\u2019re definitely shooting for a tighter community here, and we do have that.\u201dBut there\u2019s a catch. All of these new places are private spaces, and many of them quite pricey.That\u2019s a challenge in a city that aspires to be for all of its people, said Ted Landsmark, director of Northeastern\u2019s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. Cities, after all, aren\u2019t just blocks and buildings, but places where \u201cjoyful interactions\u201d can bring people together.Related: More than 1 million Americans have died of COVID-19. Why is there no national day to remember them?\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on public leadership to encourage those kinds of informal interactions,\u201d Landsmark said, \u201cparticularly around entertainment, shopping, play, and culture.\u201dThat can take various forms, he said, from public art to public gatherings \u2014 both of which the Wu administration has experimented with \u2014 to lowering T fares on weekends to draw more young people downtown. It can mean ensuring that major developments include space for civic life \u2014 such as the popular new plaza atop the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Lyrik building. And it can mean making more of the public spaces Boston is fortunate to have, especially along Boston Harbor, where longstanding efforts to increase access still have a ways to go.A pedestrian walked through the Lyrik Plaza area built for people to gather that is part of a new development built over the Mass. Turnpike.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe Fenno/Gomez family, of Boston, visited the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, on the launch day of Boston Family Days. Family Days is an expansion of the BPS Sundays pilot program that allows free access to museums, zoos, the ICA, and other attractions.  Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\u201cOther cities have activated their waterfronts,\u201d more than we have, Landsmark said. \u201cWe still tend to underutilize our location on the ocean.\u201dBoston\u2019s waterfront is just one untapped resource. The city is also looking to increase access to its world-class cultural institutions, and attempting to find ways to make them feel more welcoming to people from across the city.That\u2019s the idea behind Boston Family Days, a program Wu launched in 2024 and expanded this year. It allows any family in Boston with children to visit any of nine museums on the first two Sundays of each month for free. Over 44,000 people participated in 2024, and 11,000 more have signed on this year.\u201cEvery young person in the city deserves to feel at home in every part of our city,\u201d Wu said.Related: During COVID, vaccines were the path to \u2018herd immunity.\u2019 Now, a growing number don\u2019t want to be part of the herd.Indeed, Wu said, we all know what cities need to thrive. Even kids. Every year, Wu meets with a kindergarten class at the Boston Society of Architects, and organizers ask the kids to design a model city. You might think they\u2019d draw skyscrapers, Wu said, but the kids had other plans.During a recent showcase, the mayor recalled, one child drew gigantic beds \u2014 so everyone would have a place to sleep \u2014 another designed a free ice cream store, and a third a massive owls\u2019 nest. Why? So the owls can come out at night and catch all the rats.\u201cEven at a young age our kindergartners understand our cities have to be safe, beautiful, welcoming and fun,\u201d Wu said. \u201cEspecially now, when everything does feel so disjointed and isolated, people are looking for experiences to have together.\u201dThat\u2019s what cities have always been for. Before that week they shut down five years ago. And still today.\n\n\nHow we reported this story\nThe \"social exploration\" data in this story come from an analysis by a team of researchers from the Social Urban Networks Lab at Northeastern University\u2019s Network Science Institute. They are: Esteban Moro, Hamish Gibbs, and Bijin Joseph.\n\r\nTheir analysis examines movement patterns across the core Boston metro Area, leveraging millions of anonymized and aggregated visits derived from mobile phone data. The researchers measured the proportion of movements occurring between areas (census block groups) with different income levels, defined using income quantiles based on median household income estimates from the US Census Bureau.\r\n\nThe changes depict the shift in social exploration, aggregated by ZIP code, between 2019 and 2024.\r\n\n\nYoohyun Jung and Catherine Carlock of the Globe staff contributed to this report.Janelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com.

        "content": "\u201cSouthern Charm\u201d personality Madison LeCroy has snagged a buyer for her Charleston, South Carolina digs just 10 days after slapping a $1.75 million price tag on it, The Post has learned.\nThe final sale price, however, has not yet been disclosed as the sale has not yet been finalized.\nLeCroy bought the spacious 2,800-square-foot abode, boasting four beds and four baths, in April 2022 for $1.48 million, according to property records.\nThe home first hit the market on March 7. It entered contract on March 17.\nTim Schneider with The Cassina Group held the listing, but could not comment on the final sale price while the home sale remains pending.\n\u201cRenovation and interior design can be a daunting task \u2014 homes like this one that strike that balance between being ultra-specific versus needing everything sell very quickly,\u201d Schneider told The Post. \u201cA few potential buyers even asked if they would sell the home with the furniture and the gym equipment.\u201d\nLocated on Daniel Island, the home sports double front porches, brick steps and a crisp new exterior on a quiet street.\nInside, there are white oak floors, an airy open layout, a living room with a gas fireplace \u2014 and a chef\u2019s kitchen decked out with green cabinets, quartz counters and stainless steel appliances. The pad also features a den, a full bathroom, a screened porch with modern touches and a deck.\nUpstairs, the primary suite comes with its own porch, dual walk-in closets, a luxe tub and a big shower, plus two more bedrooms, another bathroom, laundry and attic space.\nA bonus room above the garage \u2014 complete with a kitchen, a bedroom, a living area, a bathroom and laundry hookups \u2014 serves as LeCroy\u2019s dressing room. The two-car garage, now with a slick epoxy floor, doubles as a personal gym.\nThe quick sale coincides with LeCroy\u2019s big news: she\u2019s expecting her second child, her first with husband Brett Randle, 38. The baby girl is due this summer.\n\u201cHonestly, we\u2019ve loved this house, but it\u2019s time for something that fits where we\u2019re headed next,\u201d she toldthe Daily Dish. \u201cLife\u2019s changing, our family\u2019s growing, and I\u2019ve got big dreams, so why not level up?\u201d\nLeCroy\u2019s already eyeing her next Charleston-area home with Randle.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say \u2026 it\u2019s exactly what we need,\u201d she wrote in an email to the outlet. \u201cMore space, more charm and plenty of room for our family to grow.\u201d\nThe mom of 12-year-old Hudson says she\u2019s pumped to renovate again and plans to bring fans along for the ride.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got everything we\u2019ve wanted and then some, so get ready because y\u2019all know I\u2019ll be making it perfect!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course, I\u2019ll be sharing every step of the way, so stay tuned!\u201d\nThough Randle splits time between California and the East Coast for work, LeCroy\u2019s sticking close to home.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going far!\u201d she added. \u201cCharleston is home, and it\u2019s where we want to raise our children. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Renters across the U.S. can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for the time being, asrent pricesnationwide have fallen for the 19th straight month\u2014but a looming construction shortage could spell trouble in the near future.\nThe median asking rent price across the 50 largest metros slid to $1,691 in February, shedding $15 compared with the same time a year ago, writesRealtor.com\u00aesenior economistJoel Bernerin theFebruary 2025 Rental Report.\nEven though the rents have been gradually decreasing over the past year and a half, the bad news is that Americans are still paying much more for housing than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic, when the national rent was over 14% lower.\nThe declining rental rates have been a double-edged sword because they have made building multifamily housing less appealing to investors over the past few years.\nAccording to Berner, that could result in lower rental unit inventory going forward and, in turn, cause rent prices to go up.\nIn 2024, fewer than 294,000 units in multifamily rentals were permitted for construction across the 50 largest metros from coast to coast, the lowest number since 2017.\nEven at the height of the pandemic in 2020, there were more units permitted, at 318,000.\n\u201cThis represents a major retreat in multifamily construction permitting, no doubt due to the fact that rents were falling year over year throughout 2024,\u201d says Berner.\nAccording to economists\u2019 projections, if the supply of new rental units continues dwindling, as the latest permitting figures suggest, the downward trajectory of rent prices may not be sustained.\n\u201cWe expect rents to start to grow again in the coming years as the pace of new units hitting the market slows,\u201d warns Berner.\nNew York Cityin February earned the dubious honor of having the highest annual rent growth of any metro in the U.S.\nThe median rent for an apartment in New York City climbed to an eye-popping $2,977, up nearly 7% from the same time last year, and more than $1,000 than the current national median.\nThe dramatic price surge followed a slight dip in multifamily permitting in New York City, which saw 42,230 construction permits issued in 2024, a downtick of 9.5% from 2019.\n\u201cWe expect rent to continue to rise in the Big Apple for this reason,\u201d notes Berner.\nNine other major metros experienced rising rent prices amid a dearth of permitted multifamily units, includingBaltimore,Boston,Detroit, andSan Jose, CA.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom when it comes to rental supply. The latest data analyzed by Realtor.com researchers showed a lot of regional variation in inventory and rent price levels.\nNine of the top 50 metros experienced a boost in multifamily permitting in 2024 than the previous five years at the same time that rents decreased year over year.\n\u201cWhere demand is already weakening and supply is expanding, we anticipate more significant downward pressure on rents,\u201d according to Berner.\nA typical rental unit inSan Diegosaw its monthly rate plunge by 6%, to $2,667, after the number of permitted multifamily units in the city jumped by nearly 19% in 2024.\nBirmingham, AL, saw a similar trend, with the median rental price dropping by 5.4%, to $1,165, following a 22% upswing in construction permitting.\nAlthough Denver saw a sizable 41% decrease in multifamily construction last year, the city\u2019s median rent experienced the steepest annual drop of all the metros in February, shedding 6.4%, to arrive at $1,773.\nStudio rent prices generally tend to be volatile, but in February they matched one- and two-bedroom unit rent growth compared with the same period a year ago, at a level of just above -1%.\nA typical studio unit in February had a median rent of $1,413, down 0.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the median rent for a one-bedroom unit was $1,583, while a two-bedroom apartment could be rented for $1,887, with both of those figures representing a 0.7% annual decrease.\n\u201cThis is due to the market stabilizing in a pattern of consistent price retreat,\u201d explains Berner.\nA zoomed-out view reveals that studio units have had the smallest rent growth from five years ago, at 9.7%, as two-bedroom apartments have had the steepest uptick in rents, at 18.3%.\n\u201cStronger long-term rent growth for larger units could be attributed to the fact that fewer young renters are becoming first-time homebuyers amid high home prices and high mortgage rates, andfewer young people are forming independent householdslikely living with roommates instead, keeping demand for larger rentals elevated,\u201d says Berner.\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -6.4%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,773\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -6%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,667\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -5.4%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,165\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -4.8%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,462\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.6%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,071\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.5%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,458\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.3%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,293\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.3%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,678\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.1%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,492\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.0%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,170\nAdvertisement",

Really, I didn\u2019t even think something like this could happen.\u201d\nBut it did. After Turner\u2019s ex-husband,\u00a0Keith \u2014 a long-haul trucker \u2014 left the house unattended for a period of time, two strangers,\u00a0Aaron Polmanteer\u00a0and\u00a0Lledera Hollen, forced their way in.\nOnce inside, they found personal documents belonging to the Turners, forged new ones, and assumed their identities.\n\u201cSquatters stole my house,\u201d Turner said, still in disbelief. \u201cThey actually moved in, posed as me, and sold my house.\u201d\nWith fraudulent paperwork in hand, Polmanteer and Hollen successfully listed and sold the home to real estate investors for $200,000 \u2014 all without the Turners knowing.\nThey might have gotten away with it too, but they ran into trouble when they tried to cash checks written out in the Turners\u2019 names.\nPolmanteer and Hollen now await trial, and Turner\u2019s home is back in the right hands. But the story highlights a growing trend of criminals selling property without the homeowners knowing about it. Here\u2019s how to guard yourself against this disturbing crime.\nYour keys give you physical access to your home, but yourtitlesecures your legal right to it. That right is recorded on adeed, the legal document that proves who holds ownership.\nIn a legitimate real estate transaction, the title transfer is carefully overseen by areal estate agent, title company, and notary to ensure everything is properly documented.\nBut fraudsters know how to manipulate the system, sometimes slipping through these safeguards undetected.\nJust ask Turner. By forging documents and impersonating her and her ex-husband, Polmanteer and Hollen were able to fool a title company and notary.\nBy the time Turner realized what had happened, the property had already changed hands on paper.\nWhen Turner saw the forged documents, she was stunned. \u201cThat is not my name, and that\u2019s not my signature,\u201d she said in an interview with ABC 15 Arizona. \u201cHow does this happen? At what point did someone not do their job?\u201d\nTitle fraudis on the rise and can happen to anyone, but properties that are vacant or mortgage-free are at the greatest risk.\nWithout proactive safeguards, homeowners may not discover their title has been stolen until long after its changed hands.\nMonitoring your property is essential to combat title theft. Many counties, including Maricopa County where Turner\u2019s home is located, offer free notifications whenever a document is recorded in your name.\nThis means if someonefraudulently files a deed transferon your property, you\u2019ll be notified immediately, giving you a chance to notify authorities.\nAnother way to catch fraud before it happens is to set up a simple Google alert for your address.\nBad actors sometimes list stolen properties for sale before homeowners even realize something is wrong. A Google alert will notify you any time your address is mentioned on the web.\nA title company\u2019s job is to ensure a property changes hands from seller to buyer without hidden issues like fraud.\nAs part of this process, they conduct thorough research into the property\u2019s history, checking for outstanding mortgages,liens, judgments, or unpaid taxes that could affect ownership.\nOnce they confirm a title is clear, the company compiles a title report and issues title insurance, which protects buyers from financial or legal trouble if hidden claims or fraud surface down the road\u2014like in the Turners\u2019 case.\nWhile fraud isn\u2019t always preventable,title insurancecan serve as a financial safety net, ensuring that homeowners and buyers aren\u2019t left paying for someone else\u2019s deception.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nThe fraudsters who stole the Turners\u2019 home were able to do so after accessing personal documents that helped them forge ownership records.\nWhether your home is occupied or vacant, taking simple precautions can help prevent this type of theft:\nIf you think someone has tampered with your home\u2019s title, act fast. The sooner you catch fraudulent activity, the better your chances are of reclaiming ownership.\nBy acting quickly and leveraging the right legal and investigative resources, you can work toward reclaiming your property.\nAdvertisement",

Over the next two decades, fourteen mill houses were lost to decay, the boarding house was demolished, and the abandoned site took on the appearance of a ghost town.\u201d\nThe official website notes that the main mill was believed to have burnt to the ground because of a lightening strike.\n\u201cHenry River is an example of history that seems so distant, yet it can still be seen, touched and heard with our own eyes and ears,\u201d the site reads.\nThe current owners, who are known only as Henry River Mill Village LLC, purchased the property in October 2017.\nAt the time of filming, there was a different owner.\nFans of the film franchise may be able to see the village on the big screen again soon asSuzanne Collins, author of \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d novels, revealed that the fifth installment,\u00a0\u201cSunrise on the Reaping,\u201d will hit shelves March 18.\nThe movie adaptation will debut in theaters in November 2026.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "San Jose, CA,\u00a0is cracking down on \u201cvanlords,\u201d whom city officials say are \u201cbad actors\u201d charging the homeless to live in dilapidated, nonworking vans.\n\u201cThis is a problem that flies under the radar, but my office has heard directly from residents about exploitative vanlords taking advantage of desperate renters searching for affordable housing,\u201d Councilmember\u00a0David Cohen\u00a0tells Realtor.com. \u201cThese rentals use city property to take advantage of vulnerable tenants without having to follow tenant protections for rental properties that protect the safety and financial well-being of lower income people.\u201d\nCohen\u2019s office sent Realtor.com photos of Facebook Marketplace listings showingRVs illegally for rent.\nOne had a monthly rent of $1,300 and another for $800.\nThe listings were active, and only a couple of many such listings. Some vanlords may charge even more.\n\u201cBy creating an ordinance to outlaw these rentals, we set an expectation of appropriate behavior,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cOur goal is to prevent this crisis from worsening, by shining some light on the situation before it becomes unmanageable.\u201d\nSaid Councilmember\u00a0Bien Doan\u00a0at a March 12 meeting addressing the issue: \u201cWe know there are bad actors out there that put dilapidated, nonworking van trailers or RVs out there, and then manipulate our unsheltered residents to rent these places inunsafe conditions, without any preparation for biohazard or hazardous waste or even a fire hazard.\u201d\nAccording to the\u00a0San Jose Spotlight, there are \u201ctwo known individuals\u201d who are renting out at least 20 motor homes to homeless people.\nIn 2023, police officers discovered one of these vanlords had purchased four to six RVs from a tow yard, set them up on Educational Park Drive and Las Plumas Avenue, and was charging people rent to live in them. According to the city, this activity is illegal.\nA September 2024\u00a0memofrom Chief of Police\u00a0Anthony Mata\u00a0sent to the City Council said that most of the RVs parked on the streets of San Jose did not belong to any of the houses nearby but were \u201cunregistered and unofficially owned by unhoused individuals who are using them as shelter.\u201d\nPolice said they had received hundreds of complaints about the vehicles, but that in general, it was not city policy to tow the vehicles if they were being used as shelter by individuals.\nPolice cited \u201cconcerns about individuals illegally placing RVs on public streets and renting those RVs to unhoused individuals.\u201d\nIt noted that the city of Los Angeles was taking action to curb \u201cvanlording activity\u201d by drafting an ordinance that would prohibit leasing and renting out RVs if they were parked on public streets.\nThe memo stressed that the police department was concerned about the vanlords, not the renters.\n\u201cThe focus of the issue is not the unhoused individuals living in the RVs, but rather the persons renting them and illegally placing them in public space to generate personal income,\u201d said the memo.\n\u201cThe City has an interest in enterprising individuals preying on the unhoused population of the city and capitalizing on their misfortunes by renting them RVs that have not passed safety inspections andlack basic plumbing and sewage removal.\u201d\nHowever, police say the vanlord issue doesn\u2019t seem to be widespread, and most people living in the RVs were not paying rent.\n\u201cThere does not appear to be a significant number of private individuals leasing or subleasing RVs to multiple people,\u201d said the memo.\nSan Francisco, Long Beach, San Diego, and Fresno have noted similar issues with RVs parked illegally on the streets. However, according to the same police memo, they are not taking action to prevent it at this time.\n\u201cStaff\u2019s research indicates that \u2018vanlording\u2019 is not currently a pervasive problem in San Jose,\u201d it said.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Doan and Councilmembers\u00a0Michael Mulcahy\u00a0and\u00a0David Cohen\u00a0from wanting to prevent the issue entirely.\nThe Rules Committee\u00a0recommended studying the problem and reporting back to the City Council in two weeks.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nAt least one RV resident,\u00a0Rudy Ortega, said he believes the crackdown is all about\u00a0Mayor Matt Mahan\u00a0wanting to sweep the streets of homeless people before an important event.\n\u201cHe wants to clear the streets of the homeless [before] the Super Bowl,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI think it\u2019s done purposely. It\u2019s another one of his tactics.\u201d\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled to be held Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, which is a 15-minute drive from downtown San Jose.\nOrtega, who lives in an RV parked near Columbus Park and is apparently not renting, filed a restraining order against the city in 2022. However, a judged ruled he had to leave the area anyway.\nThe city has held a series of \u201csweeps\u201d meant to clear the streets of homeless encampments and illegally parked RVs, butmost homeless\u00a0simply return\u00a0to swept areasafter a certain amount of time.\nOrtega had a camper parked on the streets that reportedly was full of dead rodents.\nIt\u2019s unclear where exactly Ortega is living now, but he told the San Jose Spotlight that he knows of only one individual who is renting an RV. He points out that the real issue isn\u2019t the RVs but the unaffordability of housing.\nMeanwhile,Juanita Macias\u00a0told\u00a0ABC7that she once rented an RV for \u201c$500 every month\u201d and it didn\u2019t include electricity or water.\nMany of her \u201cneighbors are still renting RVs,\u201d she said, with landlords charging about \u201ca thousand, $800 sometimes.\u201d\nThe median home list price in San Jose is an eye-popping $1.4 million, well above the national median of\u00a0$400,500\u00a0as of February, according to\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae. Renting is no better. The median rent is $3,180.\n\u201cBy restricting the sale, rental, or even transfer of RVs, you\u2019re targeting one of the last remaining options for shelter that unhoused individuals can afford,\u201d Ortega said at the recent City Council meeting.\n\u201cInstead of punishing those who seek shelter in RVs, the city should focus on providing real humane housing solutions.\u00a0If safety is the\u00a0concern, then provide sanitation services in designated areas with proper oversight, not further displacement.\u201d\nBut Cohen insisted that the issue isn\u2019t the homeless but the vanlords.\n\u201cOur concerns are for people who are putting out old, inoperable vehicles and then renting them to people to live in, as opposed to people who own their own RVs\u2014which is not at all the target of this potential ordinance,\u201d he said.\nRealtor.com reached out to Doan, Mahan, and local homeless nonprofit organizationHomeFirstfor comment.\nAdvertisement",

Recent data fromRealtor.com revealedfive red-hot US metros where single-family homes are selling the fastest, and they\u2019re all coastal hubs.\u00a0Despite rapid-fire sales, however, median listing prices declined across the board.\nHomes in San Jose, California topped the list with a median shelf life of just 22 days on the market. That\u2019s well below the nationwide median of 66 days. The San Jose market is highly competitive and consistently ranks among the nation\u2019s most expensive. Single-family homes in the Silicon Valley city clocked in at a median price of $1.3 million in February.\nJust an hour\u2019s drive away is the country\u2019s second hottest market \u2014 San Francisco. Home prices in the notoriously pricey city by the bay hit a median cost of nearly $900,000 in February. The typical San Fran home only stayed on the market for 30 days last month.\nAcross the country, the third fastest-moving market was Boston, where homes lingered for as little as 33 days. Beantown sold big in February, with a median asking price of $839,450.\nBesides Boston, Washington, DC is the only other metro outside of California that made the list. Properties in the nation\u2019s capital tied with San Diego for a median of 34 days on the market.\nHomes in sunny San Diego listed for a median of nearly $950,000. Properties in DC listed for around $580,000 last month, but tides may be turning for that market. All eyes remain onthe ongoing real estate impactsof mass federal worker layoffs.\nThis recent data comes from Realtor.com\u2019smonthly report on housing market trends. Despite the high demand seen in metros like San Jose and Boston, monthly data over the past year has broadly revealed a shift towards a buyer\u2019s market.\nPrices have slowed even in the top five fastest-selling metros. According to Realtor.com data, every single one of these cities saw year-over-year median listing price declines, ranging from a 9% drop in San Francisco to 1.8% dip in Boston.\nThe total number of for-sale nationwide homes is nearly 30% higher than last year, according to the February\u2019s report, and the total number of unsold homes increased in the same period by almost 20%.\nAdvertisement",

Walser Jr. House, a rare Prairie-style relic nestled in the Austin neighborhood, is one of just five surviving Wright designs of its kind in Chicago \u2014 and it\u2019s teetering on the edge of collapse after years of neglect.\nEvery spring, the folks at Preservation Chicago drop theirChicago 7 list, spotlighting the city\u2019s most endangered architectural treasures, which includes this very property.\n\u201cThe Walser House had been on our watchlist of buildings for several years,\u201d Ward Miller, the group\u2019s executive director, toldArtnet News.\n\u201cThe vacancy of the building, along with the visual inspection of the building\u2019s interior and noting both the water damage and vandalism, lead us to make this a priority and emergency advocacy effort.\u201d\nThis architectural stunner was whipped up in 1903 for printing bigwig Joseph Jacob Walser, with Wright keeping costs low at $4,000 \u2014 about $150,000 in today\u2019s figures.\nIts design includes wide eaves, a breezy layout, custom furniture and dazzling art glass windows. But now, the place is deteriorating. The last owners, Anne and Hurley Teague, scooped it up in 1970.\nHurley, a contractor, worked diligently to keep it standing until he passed away 1997. Anne followed in 2019, and since then, the house has been left to rot, battered by Chicago\u2019s notoriously brutal weather.\n\u201cThe house has been unoccupied and unmaintained for the past six years,\u201d thePreservation Chicago\u2019s websitesays.\nEven with some patchwork fixes and brush-clearing by do-gooders, the whole property is screaming for a top-to-bottom overhaul.\n\u201cEvery part of this house needs attention,\u201d\u00a0TheFrank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancyadded on its website, asking for someone to swoop in, shore it up and bring it back to life.\nDesignated a Chicago Landmark in 1981 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, the house can\u2019t be torn down \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe from falling apart.\nA reverse mortgage from 2003 and ongoing foreclosure fights are gumming up the works, according to theAustin Weekly News.\n\u201cThis needs to occur quickly,\u201d Miller told Artnet. \u201cThe home is very susceptible to environmental conditions and also to people breaking and entering onto the property.\u201d\nWith advocacy crews like Preservation Chicago and the Conservancy keeping tabs, they\u2019re pushing hard to speed up the legal mess.\nA new owner could tap into federal and state tax breaks to fund the fix-up, but the clock\u2019s ticking.\n\u201cIts longtime owners tried their very best to maintain the home, despite the costs associated with some of the various needs and requirements, as they continued to age,\u201d Miller toldArchitectural Digest.\n\u201cWe need the community to voice their support for this amazing house and be a partner in its restoration, repair and revival.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also pleading with City Hall to help fund the resurrection of Wright\u2019s vision before it\u2019s too late.\nAdvertisement",

More than 3.2 million people call the state home, according to an estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau.\nOhio is the second-most affordable state when it comes to getting a home, with Canton, Youngstown and\u00a0many other Ohio locales\u00a0seeing affordable prices, per Redfin. The real estate company pegged the state\u2019s median sale price at $231,400 and its median monthly housing payment at $1,472.\nRedfin said Oklahoma ranked No. 3, with homes there selling for a median $236,700.\nThe Mountain State boasts a median sale price of $243,100, according to the analysis. It derives its nickname from the well-known Appalachian Mountains that run through it.\nHouseholds in Michigan earn a median of $71,149, Redfin reported, citing the U.S. Census Bureau. Its No. 5 spot for buying a home is thanks to its $248,000 median sale price.\nMississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Indiana and Arkansas were the five other states that Redfin ranked among the 10 cheapest when it came to homes.\nMeanwhile, with homes going for a median of $785,200, California earned 50th place on the ranking, meaning it was the priciest state, the analysis found.\nSome Americans have had difficulty purchasing homes in recent years amid the housing affordability crisis that the U.S. has been contending with.\nLast month, a survey released by Bankrate found 81% of Americans \u201cwho have owned a home in the past or never owned a home but want to some day\u201d called down payments and closing costs a \u201csignificant obstacle\u201d to getting a place.\nAbout 76% ofaspiring homeownersestimated the amount of time it will take them to sock away sufficient funds for a house down payment at one year or more, according to Bankrate.\nMany U.S. adults \u2014 75% \u2014 still consider homeownership to be a component of the American Dream, Realtor.com found in a separate January survey.\nAdvertisement",

But for someone who\u2019s looking to score a home in Brookline\u2019s coveted Fisher Hill neighborhood, the petite pad might be just what they\u2019re looking for.\nOriginally part of a single property with a two-family home next door, the property was condo-ized in 1984. The space was\u00a0likely a caretaker cottage for the larger property\u2019s staff. Now, it functions as three independent homes in the same HOA.\n\u201cFunctionally, it works more like a single-family home, even though it\u2019s part of the association,\u201d saysMatt Montgomeryof the Matt Montgomery Group at Compass, who has thelisting.\nA stone walkway with a mature tree on the side leads up to the home, which greets visitors with its main living space. Bright, white walls and wall-to-wall carpeting run throughout the 181-square-foot living room, which features three windows. To the left is a wood-burning fireplace, which was previously closed off for renters but could be updated to fully function once again. A closet, the sole one in the home, features a water heater and storage space.\nA ladder leads up to the sleeping loft, which is home to four-foot ceilings.\n\u201cThe sleeping loft incorporates probably two-thirds of the roof line,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cIt\u2019s quite large up there.\u201d\nContinue into the 56-square-foot kitchen, which features engineered hardwood flooring and stainless steel appliances. A larger window over the sink, which has double cabinets below, looks outside. There are several other wooden cabinets and room for a butcher block.\nTo the left is the 30-square-foot bathroom that features a shower, as well as a window looking outside.\nThe land is all common, but unit 3 has a small outdoor space to enjoy on their own.\nThe home\u2019s proximity to Brookline High School, the Brookline Reservoir, and the MBTA makes it an ideal spot for a commuter. There is a designated parking space for the unit at the end of the driveway.\nThe\u00a0$75 monthly HOA fee pays the\u00a0unit\u2019s share toward master insurance, water, sewer, and snow removal, and has 10% ownership in the entire property.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Hold off on that big expansion for now.That\u2019s the bottom line for the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center in an extensive report prepared by a team of consultants led by hotel specialist Pinnacle Advisory Group, and shared with the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority board on Thursday. The consultants say that it would not be wise to pursue a long-planned $1.9 billion expansion to the convention center until more hotels get built nearby. Specifically, the Pinnacle team suggests an additional 800 to 1,000 new rooms need to be built in the Seaport that are \u201ccommittable\u201d to the MCCA \u2014 that is, the authority has access to room block agreements in the hotels, or full control of them \u2014 before the ambitious expansion should proceed.The team did point to a scaled back option as a doable alternative: a nearly $500 million addition that primarily consists of a second ballroom. This addition, Pinnacle said, could accommodate groups and local events, generate incremental extra revenue for the MCCA, and help Boston compete for conventions against other cities. The ballroom addition could include some space to showcase local companies and groups, the Pinnacle report suggested, hopefully driving more business to Boston-area vendors.Separately, a developer submitted a letter to the city of Boston\u2019s planning department this month describing plans for a 15-story hotel with 438 rooms to be built behind the Aloft and Element hotels across D Street from the BCEC \u2014 a project that potentially could go a long way toward meeting the need Pinnacle identified. (The developer also proposed renovating the Element, as part of the filing, increasing the total room count at the two smaller hotels to 530 from 510.)AdvertisementGovernor Maura Healey\u2019s administration commissioned the Pinnacle report last year after replacing a majority of the MCCA\u2019s board members and halting plans to sell or lease six-plus acres near the BCEC to a developer. Pinnacle was charged with analyzing the potential for all of the MCCA\u2019s properties, though there\u2019s not much room for expansion at either the Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay or the MassMutual Center in Springfield. (The report does provide supporting evidence for holding on to the Hynes, which could benefit from $300 million-plus in capital renovations over an 11-year period, instead of redeveloping it as proposed by Healey\u2019s predecessor, Charlie Baker.) The MCCA has considered different expansion concepts for the BCEC under previous governors, but now it\u2019s up to the Healey administration and new MCCA executive director Marcel Vernon to guide the facility\u2019s future.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

Some candidates: Zeus. Athena. Hercules.\n\nThe reason? This 43-unit condo complex was created out of a Classical Revival-style,Greek temple-likechurch built in 1926 that still has a front entry of three wide steps of granite, four massive limestone columns, a pediment, and a raking cornice of limestone. It was a Catholic church until about 2004, and was converted into residential housing in 2008.\n\nBoston magazine \u2014 which is now owned by The Boston Globe \u2014 recentlynamed Cambridge the top place to livein Greater Boston, and this Cambridgeport condo checks all the boxes.\n\n\nThis unit is built into the pediment, and from the living room, a wooden door with glass windows opens to a Juliet balcony with views of those columns andthe egg-and-dart moulding.\n\nTake the elevator to the walk-through for this fourth-floor duplex,starting with the entry door that leads to an open floor plan for the first of two levels in the home. The stairwell to the upper level is on the immediate left, but ahead is the kitchen, dining area, and living room that together create a wonderful setting embellished by the cherry flooring.\n\n\nThe 185-square-foot kitchen is galley style, which makes it an efficient space for the cook in the family. On the left is a bilevel counter with multiple outlets and the sink. On the other side of the counter is seating for three. On the left side is the refrigerator, gas range with an above-range microwave, and more counter space. The cabinets are cherry and the backsplash is multi-colored mini subway tile.\n\nThe kitchen flows into a dining area that is defined by a circular light fixture hanging from the ceiling. A large black-framed double-hung window on the exterior wall throws its light onto the dining table, with currently has seating for six.\n\n\nHere is a reason to stop and gawk. A wooden doorway holding large slabs of clear glass opens to the private deck. It provides an excellent perch to mull divine thoughts \u2014 or sip coffee in the morning.\n\n\nThe living room completes the open floor plan area. It\u2019s 400 square feet and along the right side, there\u2019s a trio of windows, all of which can be opened. Adjacent is a stand-alone window perfect for a potted plant. There is recessed lighting.\n\n\nFormed from the bell tower, there is now a 47-square-foot windowless office.\n\nThe living room moves past the door to the Juliet balcony and ends in a 35-square-foot half bath with tile flooring and a single vanity.\n\nOn the upper level is the primary suite, the second full bath with a laundry closet, the second bedroom, and a hallway closet.\n\n\nThe 204-square-foot primary bedroom is on the left side of this level. It\u2019s carpeted, has recessed lighting, and a support beam crossing the ceiling. Natural light comes from a set of three windows inset into the thick walls.\n\n\nTwo steps leads up to the closet that was formed from the original pediment, making it seem more like a small stage than a placid place for storage. It\u2019s 26 feet longand shelving is located at either end.\n\nThe primary bath is just on the left of the entry. It\u2019s 52 square feet and it has a single white vanity with a counter. Directly ahead and behind the clear glass door is the shower with a rectangular shower head. The backsplash and floor is mosaic tile and the walls are slabs of tile.\n\nThe second bedroom is 166 square feet, has carpeted flooring, and its own set of black-framed windows on the exterior wall. The closet is a standard design with a single door.\n\nThe second full bath is 103 square feet and has a pair of white porcelain pedestal sinks, tile flooring, and a shower/bath combination with a white subway tile backsplash. Shower splash is reduced by the use of a half-glass shower door.\n\nThis home comes with a concierge, an assigned and deeded underground parking space, private storage space, and access to a courtyard, gym, and shared rooftop.\n\nJoe Maiorana of the Steven Cohen Team of Keller Williams Realtyin Boston has the listing.

        "subhead": "Cindy Stumpo's status hasn\u2019t come without obstacles.",
        "content": "ByMadeline Bilis\n\n\nC. Stumpo Developmentsits on a small stretch of Route 9 in Chestnut Hill. From the outside, it\u2019s a nondescript brick building with a green awning, but on the inside, the office of the company\u2019s founder is anything but. There, Cindy Stumpo sits at a large white desk under a sparkling chandelier. Large black-and-white photos of her projects line the walls, showing a series of opulent interiors.\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d she told me, waving me over to watch a video on her phone. \u201cI took this yesterday.\u201d\n\nShe pressed play on a short clip at a construction site where she\u2019s teasing some of the contractors. \u201cThe homeowner is leaving,\u201d she announces in the video, laughing.\n\nStumpo put the phone down, explaining that one of the men on the site asked her if she was the property\u2019s homeowner. But she\u2019s able to find the humor in it \u2014 once she can set him straight, that is. It\u2019s a typical interaction for Stumpo, who\u2019s been labeled as \u201craw\u201d and \u201cuncensored.\u201d She doesn\u2019t hesitate to speak her mind, and never has.\n\nStumpo is usually quick to tell you she started her company in 1989 when she was 23 years old. After growing up in West Peabody, then in Newton, she earned a degree in general construction fromWentworth Institute of Technology. She traces her love for homes and homebuilding to a childhood infatuation with Christmastime, looking at light displays on impressive homes in neighboring Lynnfield.\n\n\u201cAt 14, I would say to my grandmother, \u2018Oh my God, look at those Christmas lights. Why are those Christmas lights so much prettier than other Christmas lights?\u2019\u201d said Stumpo, who\u2019s now 60. \u201cMy grandmother goes, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re seeing.\u2019 Then, as I got older, I figured out I was looking at roof lines.\u201d\n\n\nWhile she couldn\u2019t identify a hipped roof or an A-line at the time, she now sees that admiring those shining rooflines \u2014 and the stately houses \u2014 sparked her interest in homebuilding. Later, when she decided to start her own business, she realized she didn\u2019t want to be just a custom homebuilder. Stumpo rejected the idea of letting the market dictate who would hire her and who wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI knew it was going to be a hard road. Who\u2019s going to hire a 23-, 24-, or 25-year-old girl, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSo I had to go out and learn how to be a developer and a builder: Buy the land, develop the land, then go build. Then the end user would come and buy.\u201d\n\n\nAlmost immediately after she founded C. Stumpo Development, sexist comments started flowing. One early client asked to speak with her husband, who he assumed owned the company. A broker advised her to pretend that her husbanddidown the company in order to close the deal, but she refused.\n\n\u201cIf you can think of it, I\u2019ve been through it,\u201d she said.\n\nStumpo said she spent the first few months in the field keeping her head down and being careful with her delivery to both clients and contractors. Soon, she learned authenticity would take her further. Stumpo attributes part of her success to her directness and no-nonsense attitude.\n\n\u201cI realized within six months, \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank-yous\u2019 did not work out here,\u201d she said. As for what got her point across more easily on jobsites? More expletive-laden requests.\n\n\n\u201cI realized that this is Boston. This is the way we talk,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go \u2018Bless your heart.\u2019 We just don\u2019t do that, right? So that\u2019s just what it was.\u201d\n\nThese days, Stumpo acknowledged, the homebuilding environment is not as outwardly hostile to women. Still, there\u2019s work to be done for championing women in such a male-dominated industry.\n\nShe points to her daughter Samantha, who now works with her. Together, they\u2019re among one of the only second-generation female-led construction companies in the country.\n\nFor 20 years, Stumpo also has overseen a summer internship program for students interested in building. \u201cThe girls are always like, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\u201d she said. Stumpo encourages younger generations to get into the trades \u2014 especially young women. \u201cIf I knew that I was going to go down this avenue, I would have absolutely 1,000 percent went to vocational school,\u201d she said.\n\nStumpo carves out a few hours most Thursday nights to chat on the phone with two or three girls she mentors. And when she isn\u2019t working with early-career women, she\u2019s usually speaking to them, either on social media or through her WBZ NewsRadio podcast, \u201cTough as Nails.\u201d On air, she tackles subjects ranging from panic attacks to menopause, embracing openness and honesty for her listeners.\n\nHer main advice to women entering the field is simple: Don\u2019t ever let a man tell you you can\u2019t do something. \u201cYeah, I can mentor you. You can watch for me from a distance. But you have to have the confidence \u2014 I can\u2019t give that to you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to find that inner strength.\u201d Inner strength, it seems, is something Stumpo has channeled long before she ever started her company.\n\nLooking back on her career, I asked her if she had any wisdom for her younger self, or if she\u2019d do anything differently. Her answer was swift:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a goddamn thing.\u201d\n\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

The new owner\u2019s identity, as well as the price to be paid, are not yet available.\nMoore, the trailblazing star of her eponymous \u201970s sitcom \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d passed away in 2017 at Greenwich Hospital at age 80, leaving behind a legacy \u2014 and this palatial estate.\nStanding on 7.37 acres, the property boasts five bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a glass conservatory, a Jacuzzi, an elevator and a gym with spa amenities.\nOutside is a 65-foot pool and fireplace, while a separate one-bedroom apartment sits above the three-car garage.\nLevine, who poured his heart into the home alongside Moore, opened up about its allure in an email to Hearst Connecticut last year.\n\u201cThe house is special to me because it is a house that Mary and I designed, with specific intention to make it welcoming, filled with natural light, open to the outside (so you feel a part of the natural surroundings), with intimate, purposeful spaces that offer comfort and a platform for display of her favorite things, including her many and diverse collections of objet d\u2019art.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt is, unquestionably \u2018Mary\u2019s house\u2019 well reflecting her classical design aesthetic and passion for detail and use of the finest materials and artisanal methods of construction.\u201d\nThe sale comes in a market where Redfin clocks the area\u2019s median home price at $2 million as of June, with the hottest properties fetching 6% above asking and flying off the market in just 15 days.\nJoseph F. Barbieri of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty held the listing. The Post has reached out for comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Soaring home coasts are driving Florida legislators to propose radical solutions.\nMedian home prices in metros across the Sunshine State have surged in recent years alongside home-insurance premiums. In light of the crushing financial pressures on Floridians, lawmakers are now debating the reduction or total elimination of property taxes,the Wall Street Journal reported.\nThere is no US state that has successfully eliminated property taxes, althoughNorth Dakota tried and failedto become the first with a ballot measure in November. Florida is among eight states without individual income taxes, however, making it especially attractive to retirees on fixed incomes. The incentive has also brought companies \u2014 and their billionaire owners \u2014 to the growing state.\nBut the state\u2019s housing market hasn\u2019t been so sunny lately, as skyrocketing property values, condo fees and insurance premiums are pinching some Floridians\u2019 wallets. Despite success in the state\u2019s high-end luxury market, the number of unsold homes in Floridarose almost 23% year-over-year in January.\nIncreasingly property valueshits fixed-income households, like retirees, particularly hard. Redfin data cited by the Journal tracked median home prices in metros like Miami, Orlando and Tampa increasing several times over since 2012.\nNow, some Florida lawmakers are angling to address the issue by taking aim at the state\u2019s property tax, from a full repeal to smaller adjustments. The actual likelihood of such radical measures coming to fruition is unclear, but the issue has been front and center this legislative session, the Journal reported.\nThese measures include Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s plan to put a constitutional amendment abolishing or reducing property taxes on 2026 ballots, as well as State Sen. Jonathan Martin\u2019s bill requiring a study on eliminating property taxes by October. Two bills aimed at a reduction in property taxes were introduced by State Rep. Ryan Chamberlin.\nCritics of the proposals say that eliminating property taxes would force cuts to essential services and significantly hike sales taxes. Property taxes are a dominant source used by local governments for public services like schools, fire departments and libraries. In Florida, property taxes make up a significant slice of county, municipal and school district revenues, the Journal reported.\nPoliticians like DeSantis and Chamberlin have suggested various remedies to avoid the loss of revenue, including reducing waste in local government and increasing sales taxes.\nAlthough the elimination of property tax could help keep Floridians on fixed incomes in their home, it might also hurt their day-to-day spending. The Journal cited a study by the Florida Policy Institute that estimated the state\u2019s sales tax would need to be doubled to 12% in order to replace property tax revenues.\nOther states are also considering reducing or eliminating property taxes, the Journal reported, including Wyoming, Kansas and Montana.\nAdvertisement",

Recent aerial photos,first reported by Realtor.com, show their main home gutted and the nearby day cottage \u2014 in which the couple once hosted a gratis one-night Airbnb stay \u2014 razed to the ground.\nThe changes come at a quiet time for the couple, who have largely remained out of the spotlight following personal controversies over their words of support for actor and convicted rapist Danny Masterson \u2014 and Kutcher\u2019s past ties to disgraced music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs.\nThe couple purchased the two-home getaway in Santa Barbara County for $10.1 million in 2017, according to Realtor.com. The Arroyo Burro Beach home counts stars like Kevin Costner and George Lucas among its neighbors.\nThe property was originally built in 1991, according to Zillow. The 6-acre plot includes a four-bed, four-bath main house and a small cottage close to the sand.\nHeavy rainfall across the state in late 2022 and early 2023 triggered flooding and mudslides in Carpinteria, causing a waterway alongside Kutcher and Kunis\u2019 home to rise up and swamp their property with sludge and debris, Realtor.com reported. The flooding hit other notable properties in the celebrity enclave, including thebeach home of Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian.\nRecent aerial photos show the main house covered in plastic tarps, with its two-story porch, outdoor stairs and chimney gone. The day home is completely torn down.\nTheir beachside home isn\u2019t the couple\u2019s main abode. Kutcher, 47, and Kunis, 41, live in a custom-built Beverly Hills mansion with their two children.

Kutcher and Kunis offered up their day cottage up for a $0 one-night stay on Airbnb in August 2023. In turn, Airbnb made a one-time donation to Kutcher\u2019s anti-child sex abuse charity, Thorn, from which Kutcherresigned one month later.\nThe listing for the two-bedroom Santa Barbara County beach house, titled \u201cAshton & Mila\u2019s Oceanfront Oasis\u201d advertised \u201cviews of the Santa Ynez mountains,\u201d and \u201cno shortage of sights and plenty of activities to make for an unforgettable summer stay.\u201d\nListing photos showed quaint, beachy interiors, a large main bed and another room with bunkbeds. The home also included a small kitchen, a cozy sitting area and a hot tub on a picturesque deck.\nThe listing was quickly snapped up and the Hollywood pair posted videoson their socialsmeeting up with their renters.\nKunis and Kutcher have been otherwise inactive in the public sphere for the past two years. The pair faced significant controversy in 2023 when they wrote character reference letters for their former \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d co-star Danny Masterson during his rape trial, for whichthey later publicly apologized.

        "content": "It took just 82 seconds to make Boston real estate history on Friday.Shortly after 11 a.m. Friday, One Lincoln St. \u2014 a 36-story office tower in the heart of the Financial District \u2014 was auctioned, on the sidewalk, for any and all to see. The highest bidder? The very same entity that gave One Lincoln\u2019s prior owner a mortgage worth $763 million just three years ago. And the price today? Just $400 million.Though the sale hasn\u2019t yet closed \u2014 that can\u2019t happen until an April legal hearing \u2014 it\u2019s the sort of deal that could set a new, far lower, floor for the post-pandemic value of office towers in downtown Boston. And how the deal went down, well, several real estate and legal experts said they\u2019ve never seen something quite like it here before.Related: One of Boston's most recognizable buildings is about to hit the auction block.AdvertisementAbout 40 people gathered to witness the auction on blustery Friday morning at the corner of Bedford and Kingston streets, the same spot where developers broke ground on One Lincoln St. nearly 25 years ago. Third-generation auctioneer Samantha Saperstein of Holbrook-based auction house Paul E. Saperstein Co. played for the crowd a pre-recorded legal notice that lasted more than 10 minutes, even with Saperstein playing it at 1.5 speed, and was chock full of highly specific logistical details like \u201cten seconds east, 163.41 feet along the southerly side of Bedford Street.\u201dSamantha Saperstein with Paul E. Saperstein Co. Auctioneers & Appraisers, conducts an auction of One Lincoln Street on Friday morning.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe crowd mostly stayed put donned in jackets and windbreakers \u2014 though thankfully the cold rain that had poured through downtown in the early morning hours on Friday had passed. A few murmured to each other through the lengthy legal notice. When the recording stopped, Saperstein asked if qualified bidders waived reading a memorandum they had already received, and just one voice spoke up to agree: Adrienne Walker, a partner with law firm Troutman Pepper Locke in Boston who represents one of the tower\u2019s lenders, a bank subsidiary known as MSD RCOF Partners XXXIX LLC.Then the show began.\u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure? Do I hear $500 million? What\u2019s your pleasure? We gotta start somewhere,\u201d Saperstein called out to the gathered group. Heads swiveled, but no one spoke. Saperstein asked for a half-billion-dollar bid twice more before dropping down to $200 million.Advertisement\u201cGotta start somewhere, folks. You\u2019re not gonna get it for that much of a steal,\u201d she said. No one spoke either when Saperstein dropped the price to $100 million. Then she called out a number that was already in hand: $400 million.\u201cSo $400 million I have,\u201d she called, her voice rising above the gusting wind. The next bid she asked for: $450 million. No one volunteered.\u201c$400 million dollars I have once. $400 million dollars I have twice,\u201d Saperstein said, pausing each time. \u201cIs there any advance over $400 million dollars? Third and last call. Fair bidding, fair selling,\u201d \u2014 a line often spoken by her grandfather Paul Saperstein, she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no advance over $400 million dollars? You are satisfied?\u201d she asked the crowd. \u201cSold! $400 million dollars. Thank you all for attending. Everyone go get warm.\u201dRelated: Boston's office market is beginning to wobble.The entire engagement lasted just 1 minute and 22 seconds, though it\u2019s fair to expect the legal discussions behind the sale took much, much longer. The auction itself had even been delayed by 24 hours \u2014 it was originally scheduled for Thursday morning. There was no reason given for the delay, and Saperstein declined to comment.Though the public auction happened on the street corner, there was also action this week in a courtroom in Brooklyn, New York, where Fortis Property Group, which has owned the tower since 2006, asked a judge to block the sale, at least for now. The judge agreed, and set a hearing on April 4, at which point, perhaps, that $400 million figure, and what it represents about the value of one of downtown\u2019s most visible towers, may change.AdvertisementOnlookers at Friday's auction of One Lincoln Street, on Kingston Street in downtown Boston.David L.

Penthouse 406 boasts top-of-the-line amenities \u2014 and, given its height, panoramic views in many directions.\nAs far as luxury sky-high penthouses go, this one at 3 Court Square didn\u2019t spend terribly long on the market. The condo was initially listed for $12,500 a monthin November. The unit was delisted in early January andpopped back upas an$11,500-a-month listing less than two weeks later following a brokerage swap, still cementing its place as the highest-priced rental in Queens. The final price for the deal is not known; unlike sales, final lease deals are not made public.\nSkyline Tower immediately claimed two major superlatives when it opened its doors in 2019. Not only is the 67-story tower the tallest residential building in Queens, it\u2019s also the second tallest building in all of Long Island.\nIf the contract is signed, it marks a new record for Skyline Tower, beating out an $11,000-per-month penthouse rented there in October.\nThe 1,547-square-foot space includes four bedrooms and three bathrooms \u2014 two of which are ensuite.\u00a0 Wraparound, floor-to-ceiling windows offer sweeping skyline views of New York City across the East River.\nIt soars 778 feet above the borough.\nMichael Chadwick of Corcoran, the listing representative, previously called the unit \u201cthe crown jewel of the Skyline Tower Condominium.\u201d\nThe tower offers residents 24/7 doorman and concierge services, a community play area, a roof deck, a game room, a pet spa and a 75-foot-pool and much more. The best part? It\u2019s one subway stop from Manhattan \u2014 useful for the office types who now have to go to their desks at least several days per week.\nUnfortunately for Skyline Tower, the 802-unit building will not carry the crown of Queen\u2019s tallest residential edifice for much longer.

A full wall of glass opens completely for more views, the listing notes. Two additional ensuite bedrooms complete the second level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really special home.

        "content": "Homeownership is a symbol of financial stability for most Americans\u2014but for those living in states where the cost of living is higher, it might seem like they\u2019re working solely to keep a roof over their heads.\nThe median home price nationally is $412,000, according to the Realtor.com\u00a0February 2025 Monthly Housing Trends Report.Homeowners who purchase a homeat that price point will need to work approximately 10 days each month to afford the mortgage payment\u2014and that\u2019s without factoring in any other expenses.\n\u201cHome prices have significantly outpaced wage growth in recent years, widening the gap between income andhousing affordability,\u201d says\u00a0Hannah Jones,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00aesenior economic research analyst.\n\u201cThis disparity intensified during the [COVID-19] pandemic, when a surge in housing demand strained inventory, driving home prices sharply upward and increasing economic pressure on households.\u201d\nHawaii\u00a0has the highest median home list price in the nation at $796,947. Homeowners purchasing a home at this price point will need to work 17 days each month just to cover the payment of $5,222, including tax and insurance. The average hourly wage in January 2025 was $38.\nIn\u00a0California, they face a similar trend, with homeowners needing to work 15 days of the month to cover a payment of $4,773, including tax and insurance. Similarly, homeowners in\u00a0Montana\u2014where the median home list price is $613,275\u2014 would also have to work 15 days of the month.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0West Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Ohio\u00a0have the lowest median home list price, at $247,000 and $259,450, where residents will need to work about 7 and 6 days a month, respectively.\nIn other states, including\u00a0Kansas,\u00a0Missouri,\u00a0Indiana,\u00a0Illinois,\u00a0West Virginia, and\u00a0Michigan, it requires about 7 days of work each month to cover mortgage payments.\nA standard full-time jobmeans working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or about 20 to 22 days per month.\nNearly 75% of U.S. households, approximately 100.6 million, cannot afford a median-priced new home in 2025, priced at around $459,826, according to theNational Association of Home Builders.Even modest increases in home prices or mortgage rates exacerbate this affordability crisis significantly. For example, a mere $1,000 increase in median home prices would make homeownership unaffordable for an additional 115,593 households nationally.\nThe affordability crisis is not just about rising prices; it\u2019s also about a shortage of homes.\nHousing construction has not kept pace with demand, according to arecent U.S. Census Bureau report.\nAnd, the\u00a0housing shortage\u00a0will take 7.5 years to fix at the current rate of construction, according to a new\u00a0report on the housing supply gap\u00a0from the Realtor.com economic research team.\nAlthough the supply gap improved moderately in 2024, the country still fell 3.8 million units short of meeting demand relative to new household formations and pent-up demand, the analysis found.\nIn January 2025, 1.48 million new building permits were issued, but actual housing starts\u2014when construction officially begins\u2014fell to 1.37 million, a 9.8% decline from the previous month.Meanwhile, 1.65 million homes were completed, but the overall supply remains limited, pushing prices higher and making housing less affordable for many Americans.\nThis supply shortage disproportionately affects lower-income and marginalized communities. A recent McKinseyreport\u00a0highlightedthat Black Americans are among the most burdened, with nearly 60% of renters facing moderate or severe housing cost challenges.\n\u201cMore home supply at more price points can help bring earnings and home prices more in sync. Not all households are interested in buying a home, so ample rental and for-sale inventory are both important to providing affordable housing options,\u201d adds Jones.\nData methodology:To assess housing affordability, this analysis calculates the number of workdays needed to cover a median monthly mortgage payment in each state. The estimates are based on median home list prices as of February 2025 and assume a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 6.65% interest rate. Property taxes and insurance costs are factored in using a 1.7% annual rate, and calculations assume a 20% down payment. Wage data is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 January 2025 release, which tracks average hourly earnings across states.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By Beth Teitell, The Boston Globe\n\nIt was frigid out, and so icy that all over townpedestrians were tumbling. But on the 35th floor of the Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center, life felt as easy as a summer afternoon, and Richard Baumert was marveling at the lap pool: 75 feet long, surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, its water a bewitching shade of . . . let\u2019s call itconcierge blue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing laps in the sky!\u201d exclaimed Baumert, the managing partner of Millennium Partners. He sounded as awed as a child \u2014 and as strategic as a developer positioning his building against rival luxury buildings. \u201cThis is a huge draw for people.\u201d\n\nDown on earth, whererents have grown punishingand someBostonians are being pushed from their homes,affordable housing has become a central issuein the mayoral campaign.\n\nBut in the sky \u2014 the city\u2019s new status neighborhood \u2014 the fight is not over meeting the basic needs of life, but over lifestyle. It\u2019s a war of amenities. On beast mode.\n\n\nIn a world where two-bedroom condos routinely go for $2 million plus, monthly homeowners associations costs can run you $2,000 or more, and penthouses sell for tens of millions of dollars, buildings are no longer just buildings. In the words ofRicardo Rodriguez, a Coldwell Banker luxury real estate agent, they\u2019re \u201cvertical country clubs.\u201d\n\nThere are resident-only restaurants run by fancy chefs. Golf simulators that come with a wet bar. Children\u2019s playrooms that are so perfectly staged no children should be allowed. Decks landscaped to evoke the Mediterranean, screening rooms for private movie nights, IV drips, \u201cSuccession\u201d-worthy work spaces, fitness centers with locker rooms more lavish than many homes. Places just for stretching. Service so gracious it spoils you for interactions with members of your own family.\n\n\nAt The Four Seasons One Dalton, not only is the driveway covered, the sidewalks are heated. EchelonSeaport has three pools, one with a waterfall and cabanas; and a basketball court that converts into a pickleball court. At Raffles Boston Residences, there are butlers and perhaps something even better \u2014 a framing for your life that sounds like it was written byDon Draperhimself.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201dthe website reads. \u201cIt is here that we return time and again, after all our voyages of discovery. It is the beginning and end of every journey, a feeling we carry in our hearts, a memory that calls us back.\u201d\n\n\nBut perhaps most important \u2014 and competitive of all \u2014 are amenities for the dogs.\n\nAtTheMillenniumResidences at Winthrop Centerin the Financial District, canine services include aromatherapy facials, ($50), agility training ($300 for six sessions), and luxury boarding at a New Hampshire farm ($105 a night).\n\nDuring a recent tour of the dog spa, Baumert said the building also offers canine acupuncture ($65) and Reiki. As he spoke, Lila, a long-haired Dachshund, looked on, perhaps eager to have her chakras read (for $50), or maybe saddened that she doesn\u2019t live atThe Sudbury in Bulfinch Crossing.\n\n\nThere, in addition to glorious outdoor spaces for humans \u2014 including a pool and an open-air ninth-floor \u201cfront porch\u201d with rocking chairs \u2014 there\u2019s outside space for dogs, too. To run, and also to relieve themselves.\n\n\u201cSome buildings make them go indoors,\u201d said Simona LaPosta, a real estate agent with Advisors Living, who was showing a reporter around. She allowed herself a quick wince, perhaps at the thought of the odor or maybe to drive home a selling point.\n\nMany of the city\u2019s luxury towers have been built in areas that lack the charm of Back Bay or Beacon Hill, but who cares! There\u2019s no need to ever leave (except to fly to your other homes).\n\n\nAs David Bates, a real estate agent with William Raveis, wrote in hislively newsletter: \u201cBostonians once flaunted their social position by living in historic buildings with premier addresses. Today, however, the city\u2019s wealthiest residents can flex their status by owning high-floor residences in Boston\u2019s new residential skyscrapers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the city\u2019s newest luxury tower, theRitz-Carlton Residences, Boston, South Station Tower, is over a train station.\n\nBut no matter. \u201cLife Above the Clouds\u201d is how the location is positioned on the website. \u201cBeginning at an elevation of more than 450 feet\u201d the residences \u201ccomprise a collection of extraordinary private homes and amenities in the sky.\u201d\n\n\nIf we were in New York City, nicknaming convention would practically demand we call this new neighborhood \u201cBoSky.\u201d\n\nJust a generation ago, Boston was a town where even doormen weren\u2019t that common. But in the summer of 2000, the game changed, according to a 2023Globe Spotlight reporton Boston\u2019s housing crisis and the luxury tower building boom. That\u2019s when the Trinity Place condo building opened in Copley Square, with athen-astonishing claim: that life there would bring a \u201cTotal Fulfillment of Needs.\u201d Since then, more than 50 sizable developments featuring multimillion-dollar condos \u2014 both new construction and renovations \u2014 have opened in Boston.\n\nAnd by now, woe to the building that doesn\u2019t offer at least a dog-washing station, indoors though it may be.\n\n\nIn late February, Bates, the real estate agent, did a keyword search for amenities in the 763 condos on the Boston market. The goal was to see what\u2019s become a must-have \u2014 even in nonluxury buildings.\n\n\u201cConcierge,\u201d he said, reading out a keyword. \u201cThere are 224, even some in East Boston. One hundred and forty-one [listings] have apool.Decks, that\u2019s 268.Valet, there are 95. Forty-nine have some kind ofsports simulator.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, with amenity madness blooming, the term \u201cfully amenitized\u201d entered the lexicon (with coinage claimed by power broker Maggie Gold Seelig) and now it\u2019s even arrived in Beacon Hill.\n\n\n\u201cThe Archer Residencesjoined two historically significant buildings to create the first fully amenitized, full-service luxury condominium in Beacon Hill,\u201d reads the website for the seven-story project on Temple Street.\n\nAlas, even in BoSky, sometimes there must be a nod to reality. As the website for Ritz-Carlton Residences over South Station tries to boast, the location provides \u201c. . . immediate vehicular access to I-90, I-93 and the Ted Williams Tunnel.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one nightmare no amount of amenitization can buy you out of: Boston drivers.\n\nChoose a lane, buddy!\n\n\nBe civil.  Be kind.\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston. Receive the latest news and breaking updates, straight from our newsroom to your inbox.\n",

        "content": "The techies and billionaires luxuriating in Palm Beach mansions and upscale nabes like Wellington in the western part of Palm Beach County can\u2019t get enough of that easy, breezy, state income tax-free Florida lifestyle. Now, they\u2019re moving their firms with them, gobbling up Class A office space in West Palm Beach.\nAt a mere 3.95 million square feet, West Palm Beach\u2019s Central Business District is 100 times smaller than Midtown Manhattan but, thanks to the demand, it\u2019s seeing big city rents over three-digits \u2014 and now another 1 million square feet is on its way.\n\u201cPeople are moving here and moving their companies here and absorbing space,\u201d said Brian Gale of Cushman & Wakefield who is leasing the new boutique office project at 300 Banyan Blvd. \u201cIt\u2019s not musical chairs. It\u2019s positive, new-to-the-market absorption.\u201d\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, without renewals, 267,535 square feet was leased in 2024, with Class A average asking rents at $105.31.\nThere was a vacancy of 19.1% as new towers were added to the market but is quickly being absorbed with deal activity increasing 90% year over year.\nAccording to Green Street data, all of Palm Beach County has an occupancy of 90%, which has pushed up office asking rents 63% over the last five years.\nSo who are these billionaire Palm Beach boosters behind the boom? You can blame most of it on Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. His local company, Related Ross, developed and just opened a complex on a former church parking lot at the end of the Royal Park Bridge to Palm Beach known as One Flagler, where two other billionaires, John Paulson and Ron Baron, have now leased offices.\nThis 285,000-square-foot project aka 180 Lakeview Ave. is 95% leased with other tenants including Diameter Capital Partners, the Chicago-based GTCR and Vipertec at rents exceeding $120 per foot.\nDesigned by David Childs of Skidmore Owings Merrill, the crown of this 25-story tower is lit with white LEDs. Its low-rise garage is covered in lush greenery and its top serves as a 19,000-square-foot amenity terrace. Already, the buzzy Greek restaurant, Milos West Palm Beach, is a hit in its base, while a new eight-piece reflective sculpture, Portals, by Fred Eversley, has become an icon in the adjacent park.\nAcross Lakeview Avenue to the north, the red and glass towers of 777 S. Flagler Dr. have been home to Morgan Stanley since they opened in 1985. Known as Phillips Point, these two towers have 449,000 square feet, parking for 1,174 cars and a Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse \u2014 nevertheless, Related Ross is also planning upgrades.\nRoss also updated the Esperante Corporate Center at 222 Lakeview and developed the new 360 Rosemary, which is just north of Ross\u2019 signature project at CityPlace.\n\u201cThis environment, the community and the types of amenities have resonated here more than in Miami,\u201d \u00a0said Jordan Rathlev, SVP of Ross\u2019s local company, Related Ross. \u201cWe own 95% of the Class A market and are not sellers.\u201d\nBut Ross and company didn\u2019t just transform Palm Beach overnight \u2014 this explosion was decades in the making.\nAbout 30 years ago, Related, Himmel & Co. and the O\u2019Connor Group won a city request for proposals (RFP) and began developing CityPlace into a 600,000-square-foot lifestyle center with offices, condos and rental apartments surrounding about 60 retailers and restaurants. Opening in 2000, it transformed and energized downtown West Palm Beach into a walkable, mixed-use and dynamic community with green spaces and programmed activities.\n\nTo its west is the Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts which opened in 1992, while to the south, across Okeechobee Boulevard., is the Palm Beach County Convention Center which opened in 2004 (it\u2019s where Pres. Trump gave his election night victory speech last fall). The adjacent Hilton Hotel was also developed by Related.\nRathlev says the key to Ross\u2019s success boils down to health care, education, attainable housing and mobility.\n\u201cIf you need to move a company you need to have a workforce,\u201d Rathlev said. \u201cWe need to have homegrown talent.\u201d\nThat why after being inspired by his experience on New York\u2019s Cornell Tech Council, Ross is bringing Nashville\u2019s Vanderbilt University to 7 acres in the western part of the city where it will build a $300 million graduate campus designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects focused on computing, engineering and innovation tech for 1,000 students.\nIt will be situated on the east side of the Amtrak station, while the west side will soon have a $500 million, 150-bed Cleveland Clinic hospital at 400-450 Australian Ave., also orchestrated by Ross.\nLast week, Related Ross broke ground at CityPlace on two towers with 1 million square feet of offices and retail on the site of the former FAO Schwarz toy store. A Macy\u2019s closed in 2016 and is now a luxury rental.\n\u201cSmaller format stores and more tenants with an experiential presence are more appealing than department stores,\u201d said Rathlev.\nThe upcoming 25-story 15 CityPlace was designed by Arquitectonica and will be topped with an\u00a0expansive sky garden designed by Gensler. This tower will be\u00a0anchored by 150,000 square feet of medical offices and outpatient facilities for the Cleveland Clinic, which already has a smaller spot in CityPlace.\nThe adjacent,\u00a022-story 10 CityPlace was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and will feature private outdoor terraces. Both buildings are set to open in 2027.\nJust to the north is Related Ross\u2019 first luxury apartment rental, the Laurel at 575 Rosemary, where\u00a0Equinox West Palm Beach will open in 35,000 square feet at the end of 2025.\n\u201cYou have major companies, money managers and all kinds of private offices. I get calls from all over the country looking for real estate here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no wonder that local real estate insiders call the town, \u201cRelatedville.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible and unprecedented in the country,\u201d said William Reichel of Reichel Realty & Investment about Ross\u2019 reshaping of Palm Beach. \u201cHe has invested $8 to $10 billion in West Palm and has his hands in getting us a nice university and the Cleveland Clinic. There are incredible dynamics going on.\u201d\nReichel recently marketed a $10 million development site at 605 S. Olive Ave. that had five offers and is now contracted to a local developer. A 10-story building of 51,150 square feet plus parking and mechanical space can be built with zoning for anything from a boutique office to a hotel and residential.\u201cYou have major companies, money managers and all kinds of private offices,\u201d Reichel said. \u201cI get calls from all over the country looking for real estate here.\u201d\nJLL is marketing a 72,000-square-foot boutique office at 205 Datura St. with expected pricing of $48 million \u2014 around $680 per foot. It has a 257-car garage and is 80% leased to tenants including\u00a0AltaRock Partners, Sound Point Capital Management and Stone Point Capital.\nThe seller, Morning Calm, paid $14 million after PNC left in 2019 and added $10.8 million in upgrades.\n\u201cThey love the building but it\u2019s time to move some capital and look for other opportunities,\u201d said Hermen Rodriguez of JLL who leads the marketing with\u00a0Ike Ojala and Matthew McCormack.\nA few blocks north, Gale of Cushman & Wakefield is leasing the new, dramatic office building at 300 Banyan, developed by Brand Atlantic and Wheelock Street Capital and designed by B+H Architects, that is hospitality-focused with many terraces and amenities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most gorgeous boutique office building both inside and out,\u201d said Gale. Asking rents are between $110 and $120 per foot. Alvarez & Marsal and the specialty telecom contractors, Dycom Industries, are among the tenants.\nIt\u2019s adjacent to the developer\u2019s update of the low rise 111 Olive St. which hosts small offices and, soon, the Mediterranean restaurant Kyma which has a location in Related\u2019s Hudson Yards in New York.\nThe Banyan & Olive project wraps onto historic Clematis Street which reverberates with dining and even dancing when it becomes a festive, pedestrian-only party that is particularly loved by those that can walk to their very affordable condos.\nFor those that party too heartily, NYU Langone has doctors\u2019 offices on Clematis and is building a new $75 million medical tower at the nearby 324 Datura St., better to serve both its Big Apple snowbirds and those that have nested here permanently.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable evolution of West Palm Beach,\u201d said Rodriquez.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Boca Raton, long a stronghold of gated communities, golf courses and retiree-friendly condos, is suddenly in the midst of a rental boom.\nHeavyweight developers known for luxury condo towers and high-end office buildings in places like Miami are homing in on the Palm Beach County city with big bets on higher-density living.\nAbout 7,600 apartment units are being planned or developed in Boca \u2014 which is more than\u00a0four times what\u2019s been delivered to the market between 2022 and now, according to data from Yardi Matrix.\nProposals for communities of hundreds of apartments \u2014 and, in one case, over 1,000 \u2014 are finding their way onto Boca business parks, next to the Tri-Rail Station,\u00a0on Office Depot\u2019s former corporate campus and even part of a master plan for Boca\u2019s new City Hall.\nInvestors are betting that the migration of people and business to Palm Beach County is still ongoing and that employees \u2014 some priced out of a housing market where values climbed 78% in the past five years, according to Miller Samuel and Douglass Elliman \u2014 will find appeal in rental communities with pools and yoga studios, an easy walk to retail and, perhaps, the office.\n\u201cWe want all these amazing companies to come here, but we also want to provide the necessary housing for those companies to be able to thrive,\u201d said David Martin, CEO of Terra, a Miami-based luxury condo developer that\u2019s now on tap to build Boca rentals in the future City Hall neighborhood.\u00a0\u201cWorkforce housing, or attainable housing, I think is a critical piece of the puzzle.\u201d\nMartin\u2019s firm, in partnership with Frisbie Group, won a four-way competition this year for the rights to redevelop Boca\u2019s government complex, with a 2.5 million-square-foot proposal that includes a 150-room hotel, 250,000 square feet of office space \u2014 and 1,129 rental units.\u00a0The plan, at 201 West Palmetto Park Road, bested three other pitches, including one from Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross\u2019s firm, Related Ross, which came in second with a plan that leaned more heavily on building office space.\nElsewhere in Boca, Miami developer 13th Floor Investments plans to build a 340-unit apartment complex next to the Tri-Rail Station, at Yamato Road. The eight-story development will include affordable and \u201cworkforce\u201d housing, available to tenants of varying incomes, according to published reports.\nAnd further north, a partnership that acquired Office Depot\u2019s corporate campus in 2023 has big residential visions there too. Miami\u2019s Related Group, BH Group, and PEBB Enterprises just got approval for 500 apartments on the 29-acre site, in addition to\u00a043,000 square feet of retail and a 37,000-square-foot\u00a0Equinox fitness center. To make way for those plans, the partnership will demolish 246,000 square feet of office space (more than half of what\u2019s there), while keeping two other corporate buildings. Office Depot remains as a tenant.\n\u201cWorkforce housing, or attainable housing, I think is a critical piece of the puzzle.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a real shortage and a real demand,\u201d said Isaac Toledano, co-head of BH Group. \u201cNot a lot of new rentals were built in Boca at the last nine years.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you see what\u2019s going on around you in West Palm Beach and in Palm Beach County,\u201d Toledano added, citing out-of-state firms setting up Florida outposts and young employees following, \u201cit makes sense that a place like Boca will grow.\u201d\nThe great COVID migration southward has sent demand for rentals upward. The number of renter-occupied units in Boca Raton has been rising since 2019, while owner-occupied units have been decreasing since then, according to US Census data compiled by PropertyShark. In 2023, the most recent data available, there were 14,107 renter-occupied units in Boca, or 18% more than in 2019.\nRents are holding steady though \u2014 a sign that development has thus far has met, but not exceeded, demand, said Ken Johnson,\u00a0a housing economist and the Christie Kirkland Walker chair of real estate at the University of Mississippi (who retired from Boca\u2019s Florida Atlantic University last year). In February, Palm Beach County rents climbed a modest 2.31% from a year earlier, Johnson said.\n\u201cWe need to keep building \u2014 that\u2019s\u2019 the caveat,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat we need right now to really settle the housing crisis in Palm beach County\u00a0is the right number of roofs to live under. And I don\u2019t think we have enough roofs yet.\u201d",

And now, they\u2019re looking to move on to the next chapter.\nIn the episode, they mention they own an electrical company. The years since have seen their business grow in Georgia and Tennessee, we hear \u2014 and they now wish to live in a location that\u2019s central to them all.\nMade up of 5,000-plus square feet, the residence they\u2019re now leaving behind is largely quite private, sharing only a few neighbors.\nDesigned by local architect J. Michael Hunnicutt, the three-story home reflects a modern aesthetic, bolstered by insulated concrete form construction, smooth stucco finishes and barreled rooflines.\nCarly Sostheim of Corcoran Reverie holds the listing.\nThe estate caters to a discerning buyer seeking both leisure and functionality, Sostheim told The Post.\nA 350-foot deep-water dock provides immediate Gulf access, complemented by an included 2021 Berretta pontoon, with proximity to fishing grounds and Shell Island.\nThe outdoor amenities extend to a saltwater pool and spa, framed by travertine tile and glass, alongside a fully appointed summer kitchen.\nInside, the home features high ceilings, expansive windows, and a meticulously crafted kitchen with custom walnut cabinets and Caesarstone quartz surfaces.\nSostheim emphasizes the listing\u2019s unique positioning,\u00a0stating its architecture is \u201clike no other.\u201d\n\u201cSituated with a highly desirable east-west orientation, this home provides 180-degree bay views from the rear elevation and 180-degree island views from the front elevation.\u201d\nThe layout ensures that every bedroom captures serene water views, while covered patios on each level \u2014 secured with tempered glass railings \u2014 offer unobstructed vistas, including a terrace off a barrel-ceilinged office.\nApart from its on-screen history, it\u2019s the home\u2019s many features that also let it stand out.\n\u201cThis home captures all that is alluring of the Florida lifestyle,\u201d Sostheim notes.\nAdvertisement",

And though they often trade with condos (like parking spaces or storage), they\u2019re actually separate pieces of real estate with their own pint-sized deeds.\nThat also means owners must pay maintenance fees and taxes on their poolside escapes. And if their finances are sinking, they might decided to jettison their splash pads for a little floating capital. There are other senecios, too.\n\u201cIf you sell your property and the buyer doesn\u2019t want your cabana, you must sell that cabana right away,\u201d said Fern\u00a0Fodiman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nLooking to (Marco) make a splash yourself (Polo)? Go ahead, cannonball: These are the priciest cabanas in PB.\nThere are just six privately owned cabanas at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Palm Beach Gardens, a small city on South Florida\u2019s mainland, each worth a cool $1 million.\nEvery cabana has a living area, a kitchenette and a bathroom, offering a gentle reprieve from the sun, said John Greene of Douglas Elliman. He represents unit 301-302 in the development at 2200 PGA Blvd., which is slated for completion next year. Priced at $15.5 million, the condo listing includes not only the cabana, but a boat slip.\n\u201cIt gives you a sense of what you get for a million dollars in this market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a private cabana.\u201d\nThe east-facing poolside cubbies, which span up to 383 square feet, sit in the lap of luxury, looking across to the project\u2019s private marina in the North Palm Beach Waterway.\nResidents heading right to the gym or a restaurant can pop in for a quick change without going to their apartments, Greene added.\nThe 93 cabanas at Sloans Curve, at 2000 and 2001 South Ocean Blvd. on Palm Beach, are each worth about $500,000, partially due to the condo\u2019s proximity to the homes of Tommy Hilfiger and other celebrities, said Frisbie.\nFrisbie represents unit 504N in 2000 South Ocean, which is priced at $7.99 million and includes a cabana. Along with a kitchenette and a full bath, it has pretty vegetation outside and privacy from the rest of the row.\nAnd while a half-million-dollar valuation may seem absurd to some, thanks to the arch of the building, \u201cThe cabanas are nestled down in the dune and protected from the prevailing breeze,\u201d she said. Plus, \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a tiny market, as soon as one person pays it, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nOver on Palm Beach island, the Breakers at 2 N Breakers Row has 40 cabanas, each tucked discretely behind a sliding glass door.\nMeasuring 175 square feet, they offer seclusion in the pool area, which is shared by residents and their guests (leading to nasty looks in the competition for chairs on busy days).\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s 75 degrees, you just open the door and you have this amazing cross breeze,\u201d said Jack Elkins of William Raveis South Florida.\nHis listing, the 3,560-square-foot No. PH4, is priced at $17.5 million and has a cabana.\nProviding the ultimate convenience, snacks can be ordered right to it, Elkins said, but the proximity to the ocean makes it worth at least $500,000.\nFodiman sold unit 308N at 2100 South Ocean Blvd. for $8.95 million in April 2023. Nicely updated and in a desirable location along the pool, the cabana attached that sale was also worth about $500,000, she said.\nBut even at that price point, demand is driving up prices up, up and away, said Fodiman, noting that most condos have lengthy waiting lists of hopeful buyers vying for cabanas. And while those in sunny spots were once more desirable: \u201cNow people want them on the ocean side where they\u2019re not in the sun,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the ocean side, you\u2019re literally watching the waves come in. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

They can experience all of the perks of Manhattan, but then you\u2019re able to come back to a quieter, less hectic, cool, community-oriented neighborhood. It\u2019s what buyers are looking for now more than ever,\u201d she said.\nOverall, property inventory across the five boroughs fell 3.5% year-over-year, to 14,840 units for sale citywide as of January, according to StreetEasy, which noted heightened buyer competition particularly in Brooklyn.\n\u201cRight now, when a two-bedroom in Park Slope goes on the market, if it\u2019s priced correctly \u2013 automatic bidding war,\u201d Kelly said with a snap of her fingers.\n\u201cWhen you have a lack of inventory and a demand for inventory, it drives prices up. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with those increases in the outer boroughs,\u201d she said.\nAnd people are fed up with dishing out absurd amounts in monthly rent, Kelly noted.\nIn February, the average Manhattan rental price was $5,368 per month \u2013 nearly four times the national average,according to RentalRealEstate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really tough for people to rent in the city right now, and if they have the means to buy, they\u2019re coming to the conclusion that it is probably in their best interest to do so,\u201d Kelly said.\nAdvertisement",

The median age of repeat homebuyers is now 61, jumping 25 years since 1981, according to analysis from the\u00a0National Association of Realtors\u00ae.\nBut as the demographic of buyers has changed, so too have their tastes.\n\u201cAs we begin to age, we start looking at things from a different perspective\u2014a wiser set of eyes,\u201d says\u00a0Paul Dashevsky, co-founder ofGreatBuildz.\nThat added wisdom means prioritizing practicality overkeeping up with the Joneses. Retirees want more than a white picket fence: They want to maximize their\u00a0equity\u00a0by investing in a low-maintenance property in a great community that will allow them to age in place.\nWe spoke with builders, real estate agents, and senior care specialists to learn what retirees are looking for in their next home. Here\u2019s what we found:\nBaby boomers own\u00a0$84 trillion worth of real estate wealth, and they want to make the most of it in retirement. One of the chief ways they can do so is todownsize\u00a0their home, says\u00a0Karen Holt, global real estate advisor at Premier Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\u201cMany retirees are downsizing from larger family homes to single-story or low-maintenance properties,\u201d she adds.\nNot only are these properties better suited to the changing accessibility needs of older adults, but they\u2019re often cheaper to buy and maintain.\nThose savings allow retirees to make the most of their home sale proceeds and create a financial cushion to fund retirement expenses, travel, healthcare, or hobbies.\n\u201cAging-in-place improvements are crucial for many retirees,\u201d adds Holt. These home modifications use\u00a0universal design\u00a0elements to enhance the safety, accessibility, and comfort of a space.\nBut\u00a0adaptive living\u00a0is more than just a matter of practicality\u2014it\u2019s also a top design trend for 2025, according toForbes.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nHomeowners of all ages are increasingly incorporating discrete adaptations such as curbless showers, smart lighting systems, and sleek grab bars that complement the home\u2019s aesthetics.\nAs more homeowners\u00a0move less\u00a0and stay in their homes longer, design experts predict these modifications will soon become standard practice, blending safety with contemporary style.\nBy retirement, most homeowners have had enough of maintaining a property: They want to relax and enjoy the fruits of their labor. Likewise, they may not have the same disposable income they once did and opt to not spend on housekeeping services, perAARP\u2019s recommendation.\nAs such, they\u2019re drawn to durable materials that require little upkeep, and energy-efficient appliances that keep overhead costs down, says Holt.\nBut don\u2019t mistake low-maintenance with flashy tech, advises\u00a0Brandon Blakeley, co-founder and chief technology officer ofMirador Living, a platform that connects seniors with senior care.\n\u201cWhereas younger buyers might be impressed by flashy superficials like new granite countertops, TOTO toilets, or exotic hardwood floors, retirees who are looking for a new home tend to be much more focused on the \u2018peace of mind\u2019 fundamentals of a home,\u201d he says.\nThese include\u00a0Energy Star-rated appliances\u00a0that reduce utility bills and environmental impact, stain-resistant carpeting that requires little maintenance and reduces fall risk, and non-porous countertops that are easy to clean.\nRetirees want ways to enrich their freetime, not waste it. As such, they prioritize communities with proximity to recreational activities, family, and services.\n\u201cNeighborhoods with community centers offering recreational options like pickleball courts, swimming pools, and art classes are highly attractive,\u201d says Holt. \u201cSidewalks for walking and nearby places of worship further enhance the sense of community and accessibility, providing retirees with a well-rounded, engaging lifestyle.\u201d\nThese amenities offer more than just leisure activities. They foster social connections and an active lifestyle, both essential for retirees\u2019 physical and mental well-being. Communities designed with convenience in mind can significantly improve retirees\u2019 quality of life by promoting independence and social engagement, critical factors forhappiness in retirement.\nThe path to your\u00a0ideal retirement home\u00a0begins with careful consideration of your personal needs, finances, and lifestyle goals.\nStart by assessing your budget and clearly defining your priorities\u2014such as location, accessibility, or community features. While it\u2019s ideal to have all of these elements, you may have to sacrifice one for another, so creating a hierarchy of your wants can also be helpful.\nPartner with an\u00a0experienced real estate agent\u00a0who understands your situation and can streamline your search by finding homes that fit your criteria. Talk with your agent about a financing plan to make sure that you\u2019re able to maximize your equity without sacrificing your desires.\nOnce you\u2019ve aligned your vision with practical considerations, you\u2019ll be ready to move into your new chapter.\nWith an older demographic of homebuyers driving the market, it\u2019s worth marketing to this demographic if you\u2019re\u00a0selling your home\u00a0in the years ahead. But doing so will require careful consideration: \u201cThe key lies in emphasizing real benefits,\u201d says\u00a0Orlando Penner, owner and operator ofSouth County Sheds.\nThis approach resonates with retirees who value comfort and convenience more than extravagant features or superficial upgrades.\nHolt agrees with his assessment and suggests taking this practicality one step further by emphasizing location-based conveniences.\n\u201cSellers should also emphasize the proximity of their property to healthcare services, grocery stores, recreational facilities, and community centers. Highlighting local amenities like walking trails, places of worship, and social clubs can make the property even more enticing,\u201d she says.\nAfter all, retirement isn\u2019t just about the home itself; it\u2019s about the lifestyle it supports. By marketing properties as gateways to a vibrant, connected community, sellers can tap into retirees\u2019 desire for an active, fulfilling life in their golden years.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "When\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u00a0moved\u00a0back into the White House\u00a0on Jan. 20, it triggered a somewhat surprising migration trend among some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, who promptly packed their bags and relocated abroad, withmany citing their upset over his electionwin as the reason for their sudden desire to live elsewhere.\nSince Trump claimed victory over\u00a0Democratic candidate\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0in the\u00a02024 presidential election,\u00a0multiple A-listers have quit the U.S.\u00a0and moved elsewhere.\nSome, like\u00a0Eva Longoria\u00a0and\u00a0Rosie O\u2019Donnell, have publicly decried Trump\u2019s administration and made clear that it was his policies that pushed them to find a new home outside of the U.S.\nOthers, including\u00a0Ellen DeGeneres\u00a0and\u00a0Richard Gere, have been slower to link their relocations with his administration, despite being outspoken critics of Trump in the past.\nHowever, all of these stars have been quick to gush about their new home countries, with many opting to base themselves in Europe, where they have found new, luxurious dwellings that afford them the same lavish comforts as their mansions in Los Angeles or New York.\nOf course, there may well be more A-list emigrations to come, given the huge number of stars who have threatened to leave the country should Trump return to the White House\u2014including\u00a0Sharon Stone\u00a0and\u00a0Cher; however, it\u2019s understood that they are still residing primarily in the U.S.\nLess than two weeks after the presidential election took place, Texas-born actress Longoria revealed that\u00a0she had turned her back on the U.S., explaining in an interview withMarie Clairethat she was \u201cdone\u201d withlife in \u201cdystopian\u201d America.\nThe former \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star told the outlet that she and her husband,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n, had \u201cescaped\u201d the country with their son,\u00a0Santiago, 6, and were living full time between their homes in Central America and Europe.\nAlthough\u00a0the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star\u00a0says she made the decision before Trump\u2019s election win, she said she believes the country will become a \u201cscary place\u201d if the President \u201ckeeps his promises.\u201d\nLongoria conceded that she is very \u201cprivileged\u201d in her ability to move away from the country where she was born and raised\u2014and where she launched her successful acting career.\n\u201cI\u2019m privileged. I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren\u2019t so lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and my sadness is for them.\u201d\nThe actress noted that the conditions in her former home state of California were largely to blame for her decision to leave the U.S. before the election, insisting that while she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cs\u2013t\u201d on the region, she found certain aspects of it very difficult to bear.\n\u201cI had my whole adult life here. But even before [the COVID-19 pandemic], it was changing, the vibe was different. And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge,\u201d she went on. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s\u2013t on California\u2014it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.\u201d\nLongoria\u2019s official exodus from the U.S. appears to have begun in earnest in 2023, when she put her sprawling Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $22.88 million\u2014later slashing the price to $18.98 million in May 2024.\nThe listing for the home was removed in August of that same year; however, that didn\u2019t stop Longoria and her family from leaving the dwelling behind in favor of residing between her homes in Mexico and Madrid.\nAmong the first to have fled the U.S. were\u00a0DeGeneres and her wife,\u00a0Portia de Rossi, whoswapped their mansion in Montecito, CA,for an $18 million farmhouse in the British countryside, where they are understood to have been living since the end of 2024.\nWhen news of their move was made public just weeks after the election in November 2024, TMZ reported that, while the couple had purchased their U.K. home in June, months before Trump\u2019s win, their decision to \u201cget the hell out\u201d of America was cemented by his victory.\nDeGeneres was an outspoken supporter ofHarrisduring the 2024 presidential election, publicly endorsing her in a post shared on Instagram back in August.\nSoon after, it was revealed that the couple had purchased a historic farmhouse in the Cotswolds, a celebrity-loved locale that is about two hours outside of London.\nAnd if there had been any doubt about their desire to make the U.K. their permanent residence, DeGeneres and de Rossi\u2014who have made a lucrative career out of real estate investment\u2014quickly began selling off their last remaining homes in the U.S., one of which was recently sold for $5.2 million, while another remains on the market for $29.99 million.\nStill, their move has not been without its difficulties.\nAccording to one report from London-based newspaper theDaily Mail, DeGeneres quickly found herself \u201cin peril of getting on the wrong side\u201d of a high-profile member of her new neighborhood after she \u201ccommitted a \u2018technical breach'\u201d during the build of a single-story extension at her new abode in what the outlet described as a \u201cplanning clash.\u201d\nDeGeneres and de Rossi are reported to have received several objections from their neighbors, who have spoken out against their extension plan.\nDespite the protests, a spokesperson for West Oxfordshire Direct Council insisted that the Roman remains sit over 200 yards from DeGeneres and de Rossi\u2019s property and that the work was \u201ccompleted to a high standard.\u201d\nHollywood legend and outspoken Trump critic Gere made his plans tomove away from the U.S.months before the election, telling Vanity Fair Spain in April 2024 that he and his wife,\u00a0Alejandra, were relocating to her home country of Spain so that she could be closer to her family.\n\u201cIt is a beautiful place, the food is extraordinary and the people exude sensitivity and generosity, as well as a strong will to laugh and enjoy,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to going there.\n\u201cFor Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends and her culture. She was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers.\n\u201cI love Spain and the ability of the Spanish people to live transmitting joy and happiness.\u201d\nSoon after, the \u201cPretty Woman\u201d star sold his Connecticut mansion for $10.75 million in an off-market deal, just two years after purchasing the expansive pad from crooner\u00a0Paul Simon\u00a0and his wife,\u00a0Edie Brickell.\nGere and his spouse eventually relocated to their new home in Madrid with their children,\u00a0Albert, 11,\u00a0Alexander, 5, and\u00a0James, 4, shortly before Christmas, later tellingElle Espa\u00f1athat they were \u201chappier than ever\u201d with their new lives in the European country.\n\u201cThe truth is that you are seeing us in our momentum. We are happier than ever,\u201d he said during an interview with the outlet. \u201c[Alejandra is happy] because she is at home and I [am happy] because, if she is happy, I am happy.\u201d\nWhile the actor did not point to politics as the reason for his move, hedidbrand the U.S. a \u201cdark place\u201d while accepting an award from fellow Hollywood star\u00a0Antonio Banderas\u00a0in February, before going on to slam\u00a0President Trump as a \u201cbully and a thug.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all part of a universe of overlapping pain and sadness and joy. \u2026 I see this world that we\u2019re in now forgetting that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis very foolish tribalism is starting to take us over, where we think that we\u2019re all separate from each other.\n\u201cAnd we have unfortunately elected officials that don\u2019t inspire us in the way that we want to be inspired. I\u2019m coming from a place now \u2026 we\u2019re in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who is the president of the United States.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just in the U.S., it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\nKurt Cobain\u2019s widow\u00a0announced her decision to permanently ditch her home country\u00a0in favor ofrelocating to the U.K.during an appearance in London this month, telling spectators at a talk at the Royal Geographical Society that she is planning to apply for British citizenship, while branding President Trump\u2019s plans for the U.S. \u201cfrightening.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to live here,\u201d she said of her move to the U.K., according to theDaily Mail. \u201cI\u2019m finally getting my British citizenship in six months. I get to be a citizen. I\u2019m applying, man! Can\u2019t get rid of me!\u201d\nThe singer, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, 78, for years, initially moved to the U.K. from her home in Los Angeles back in 2019\u2014but says she now plans to make London her permanent home.\nThe singer-songwriter previously gushed about her love of the British city, telling theEvening Standardin 2017, \u201cI know I\u2019m going to end up there. I know what neighborhood I\u2019m going to end up in, and I know that I want to be on the Thames.\n\u201cI subscribe to this magazine called\u00a0Country Life, which is just real-estate porn and fox hunting. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nLove rose to stardom as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Hole, which she formed in 1989.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "It\u2019s finally time to say goodbye to the old Northern Avenue bridge.The 640-foot span over the Fort Point Channel opened more than a century ago, a compressed air-powered swing bridge that swiveled out of the way for ships that trawled the waterway in what was then a hotbed of industry.The people who worked Fort Point\u2019s wharves and warehouses at the start of the 20th century would not recognize the Seaport of today: a glitzy expanse of multimillion-dollar condos, swanky glass offices, and pricey restaurants. The blue-collar work has been shunted to one side of the peninsula, corralled in an army base-turned-industrial park. Through all the transformation, the Northern Avenue bridge endured \u2014 though not for much longer. The bridge has been rotting away, as things do without proper care and attention. First, the bridge was closed for cars in 1997. Then, it was fenced off for bikes and pedestrians, in 2014.Through various administrations \u2014 mayors Menino, Walsh, now Wu \u2014 city officials wrestled with the best way to reinvigorate or replace it. Now, this important vestige of the waterfront\u2019s industrial past is heading for the scrap heap.AdvertisementA view of the Northern Avenue Bridge in Boston on Dec. 3, 1985.Joe DennehyLast year, Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration received an updated assessment of the bridge\u2019s structural integrity, and the picture wasn\u2019t pretty. City officials decided to remove the superstructure, as it\u2019s called, to protect the safety of the Fort Point Channel waterway, and they have no immediate plans to replace it.So the city\u2019s Public Works Department is advancing plans to break it apart, and load the pieces onto barges to a waterfront staging area behind the Leader Bank Pavilion, for disassembly and paint removal. The concrete masonry piers that hold up the bridge would stay. The holes in the iron girders that support the bridge are getting so big, the Massachusetts Historical Commission has signaled it\u2019s fine with the demolition plans; better to take it apart now before pieces fall into the channel.In December, the commission\u2019s lead historic preservation officer asked city officials to update the paperwork, to reflect the fact that a fancy replacement that was envisioned in 2020 under then-mayor Marty Walsh is on hold. The city has budgeted $31 million so far for dealing with the bridge, including $9 million that\u2019s already been spent on design and engineering work. The Wu administration hopes to start demolition later this year, pending the necessary permit approvals from the US Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies, and says it could cost at least $20 million.AdvertisementAbout that fancy replacement: The public debate that led to its design reflected the broader tug of war in Boston between prioritizing cyclists and pedestrians, and ensuring car traffic flows unimpeded. The end result was an attempt to balance the two: the new bridge would be reinforced enough to support cars and trucks, but limited to emergency vehicles and buses that serve the Seaport. (Many of the Seaport shuttles to North Station have since been replaced by ferry service.) The price tag kept climbing, to $100 million or more. Now, those plans are getting shelved.However, the idea of building a new span across the mouth of the Fort Point Channel lives on.First, the Northern Avenue Bridge was closed for cars in 1997. Then, it was fenced off for bikes and pedestrians, in 2014.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffEnter John Sullivan, the chief engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. He\u2019s been floating an idea for more than three years to build a barrier with movable gates at the channel\u2019s entrance, to keep storm surges out, and to hold rainwater in. It\u2019s by far the most expensive element of a much broader effort by Boston Water and Sewer to address pain points throughout the city\u2019s stormwater system.At first glance, this Fort Point concept might seem a little crazy. But Sullivan, a practical guy, makes a persuasive case. Fort Point Channel is a nexus for a wide range of storm pipes that snake out to downtown, South Boston, the South End. If a heavy rain hits with a storm surge at high tide, that whole network might be overrun. Sullivan\u2019s concept would only close the floodgates at low tide if severe weather is in the forecast; the gates would then create a giant bathtub that could hold up to 160 million gallons of water as the tide rises. The water can then be released or pumped out, as the tide recedes, to avoid flooding of the properties near the channel and to protect hundreds of acres from watery devastation.AdvertisementSullivan said his team had a three-hour conversation last month with the Army Corps, which is in the midst of a thorough review of the Boston coastline\u2019s resiliency, and the federal agency seems to be warming up to this concept. If it moves forward, he said, the agency might end up paying for as much as two-thirds of the cost. That\u2019s important, especially when you size up the potential price tag: up to $767 million for submerged gates that would stay on the ocean floor and only be raised to shut the channel during bad storms. The project is not as far-fetched as it might seem: A similar barrier was installed in the 1960s at the mouth of the Providence River, protecting Rhode Island\u2019s capital city.This new Fort Point Channel barrier also would provide a logical foundation for a new footbridge, either to the north of what\u2019s left of the Northern Avenue bridge, or roughly in its existing footprint. The schematics on file at Boston Water and Sewer assume a harbor walk would be part of any dam design. (Fortifying the structure to accommodate cars can be done, but it would drive up the costs.)AdvertisementThe Northern Avenue Bridge, an important vestige of the waterfront\u2019s industrial past, is heading for the scrap heap.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffSullivan knows federal money is tight right now. Not to worry. Permitting a project of this scope could take up to five years. He doesn\u2019t expect construction to begin until the 2030s. The original conclusion in City Hall a few years ago was that the floodgates couldn\u2019t be worked into the official Northern Avenue bridge replacement project. Now that city officials are receptive to other scenarios, Sullivan said, he is hopeful about gaining traction with this combo project: a bridge above, and floodgates below.Restoring pedestrian and bike access across the channel would be welcomed by employers in the area, said Patrick Sullivan, head of the Seaport Transportation Management Association. While his group supported the compromise concept from five years ago that\u2019s now in limbo, he says some members are relieved that city officials are moving ahead with the demolition for safety reasons.The old bridge turned out to be just the right infrastructure for the Fort Point Channel at the dawn of the 20th century, to keep industry there humming along. With climate change posing an ever-increasing threat to low-lying coastal cities like Boston, these floodgates might end up as just the right project to protect the channel and its commerce for the rest of the 21st century, and beyond.City officials decided to remove the Northern Avenue Bridge to protect the safety of the Fort Point Channel waterway, and they have no immediate plans to replace it.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

        "content": "In the first major deal at MIT\u2019s ambitious overhaul of the old Volpe Center in Kendall Square, Cambridge drugmaker Biogen said Monday it will move its headquarters into a 580,000-square-foot lab and office building that will launch construction soon and open in 2028.Biogen\u2019s move comes amid a period of broad turbulence in the biotechnology industry, one that has slowed the once-voracious appetite for life-science real estate in Cambridge. It will also coincide with the 50th anniversary of the company\u2019s founding and is a sign that one of Massachusetts\u2019 biggest homegrown biotechs remains committed to the region, state officials said.\u201cBiogen has been a foundational presence in the Massachusetts life science ecosystem for close to half a century,\u201d said Governor Maura Healey, in a statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to see them begin a new era in our state.\u201dAdvertisementProbably best known for its multiple sclerosis drugs, Biogen has 1,654 employees in Massachusetts and about 7,500 employees worldwide, according to spokesperson Dan Haro. But the company has slimmed down considerably in recent years. A MassBio report in 2020 gave Biogen a Massachusetts headcount of 2,400.The 1960's-era Volpe building in Kendall Square is being demolished and its large site being redeveloped by MIT. Biogen said Monday it will move its headquarters into a new building there, to open in 2028.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffIts office space here will slim down too, at least in terms of square footage. Biogen currently owns or leases 992,000 square feet in three buildings in Kendall, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning the company is trimming about 412,000 square feet from its local footprint.But the short move from Binney Street to Broadway is significant in other ways. Biogen will consolidate teams into a single building, the first private development to go up at the Volpe site, which was long a federal transportation research facility and will be rebranded Kendall Common. Work on Biogen\u2019s building, which will be jointly developed by MIT Investment Management Co. and BioMed Realty, will begin on Monday, MIT said. MIT declined to specify a development cost.\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that Biogen \u2014 a company with such close ties to people at MIT \u2014 will make Kendall Common\u2019s first building its new home,\u201d said MIT President Sally Kornbluth in a statement. \u201cThe motto of Kendall Square might as well be \u2018talent in proximity\u2019 and Biogen\u2019s decision to intensify its presence here promises great things for the whole ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisementMIT in 2017 beat out several other major developers and paid $750 million to acquire the 14-acre site of the Volpe Transportation Systems Center, in the heart of Kendall Square between Broadway and Binney Street. The university now has city-approved plans for an eight-building, 3 million-square-foot commercial and residential project there, but could not start work until it built a new Volpe Building for the US Department of Transportation. That $530 million Volpe facility opened less than two years ago. (Earlier this month it appeared on the General Services Administration\u2019s list of properties deemed not essential to government operations and thus possibly up for sale, though that list was later taken down.)Biogen will move out of its headquarters on Binney Street in Cambridge, as well as two other buildings nearby, and consolidate into a single newly-constructed building on Broadway in Kendall Square.Vanessa Leroy/BloombergThe Biogen building at 75 Broadway would be the first of those eight projects, and the drugmaker would be its sole corporate tenant.The headquarters move marks another significant initiative by Christopher Viehbacher, who became chief executive in November 2022.\u201cNearly 50 years after first putting down roots in Kendall Square, Biogen is embarking on a new chapter in the very heart of the community that has shaped our success,\u201d Viehbacher said in a statement. \u201cOur new space will support the advancement of our pipeline of breakthrough medicines by bringing our employees together and fostering collaboration with leading scientific minds, key partners, and top talent.\u201dSince his arrival, Biogen has bought rare disease drugmaker Reata for about $7 billion, scrapped its controversial Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm, and cut roughly 11 percent of its global workforce as part of a program called \u201cFit for Growth.\u201dAdvertisementBiogen has also won full approval with its Japanese business partner Eisai of another closely watched Alzheimer\u2019s drug called Leqembi. That drug requires intravenous infusions every other week and is only one of two medications proven to at least modestly slow the advance of Alzheimer\u2019s in patients with early symptoms.Although multiple sclerosis drugs such as Tecfidera, Vumerity, Avonex, and Tysabri account for most of Biogen\u2019s income, revenue has fallen as cheaper generics became available.Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird, said consolidating Biogen\u2019s employees at one site made sense given that the company has shed hundreds of workers in Massachusetts in recent years.\u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of efforts to cut costs, and downsizing property-wise is consistent with that,\u201d he said.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

The five-floor red-brick home sits one block east of Fifth Avenue, spans 25 feet and includes six bedrooms, according to the listing. In addition to a celebrity past, the residence boasts rare luxuries, like a bi-level private garden, a wine cellar and marble clad fireplaces.\nNoble Black, who holds the listing alongside fellow Douglas Elliman agent Jennifer Kaufman Stillman, told The Post that the current owners managed to conserve the home\u2019s West Village charm despite a gut renovation.\n\u201cThe architecture of the space is so beautifully maintained,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think is very special.

Its spa-like en-suite bathroom includes a fireplace, a free-standing tub, custom marble and oak vanities, and access to one of two private garden-view terraces.\nParker and her actor husband Matthew Broderick bought the property for $18.99 million in 2011 and sold it in2015, although they spent three of those years trying to sell. The famous power couple first listed the townhouse for $25 million in 2012, and dropped the price several times until parting with it at a loss in 2015 for $18.25 million.\nDespite undertaking a full renovation at the East 10th Street residence, Parker and Broderick reportedly never lived there. Instead \u2014 in true Carrie fashion \u2014 they used the home as a giant closet,6sqft reported.\nThe current sellers, identified as Scott Sullivan and Anna Marrs,purchased the home in 2020for $15.85 million. They werepreviously featured in the Guardianfor filling their North London backyard with giant ferns, but it appears they didn\u2019t bring the same enthusiasm to their West Village environs.\nListing photos show a partially paved backyard with well-manicured shrubs and a light tree canopy.\nWhile SJP\u2019s former pad is certainly nice to look at, it\u2019s not getting nearly as much attention as the West Village home of her \u201cSex and the City\u201d character, Carrie Bradshaw.\nThe real-life owner of the brownstonemade headlines last weekwhen he was caught on camera confronting selfie-taking tourists, shouting \u201cIt\u2019s not Carrie\u2019s, it\u2019s mine!\u201d\nThe owner is currently petitioning the city\u2019s Landmark Preservation Committee for a steel and cast-iron gate to deter unwanted visitors, who have flocked there for photos for years.\nAdvertisement",

The first phase includes 502 underground parking spaces and 28,500 square feet of retail and community space, along with 1.9 acres of public open space.While the Longwood Medical Area is an academic and research powerhouse, employing nearly 73,000 people and drawing in more than 24,000 students, the neighborhood\u2019s amenities don\u2019t match its institutional prestige, Skanska and Simmons said in their city filing.\u201cThe sidewalks are narrow, food and beverage options are limited, and while the LMA is bordered in part by the Emerald Necklace, the majority of open space found within the LMA is located inside the fenced in campuses of private institutions,\u201d the filing states. \u201cThere is a notable absence of publicly accessible open space within the LMA, and the project endeavors to create a new community commons and neighborhood public gathering space that will provide a range of publicly accessible amenities that will seek to activate the corridor from morning until night.\u201dSome of those planned open spaces include a 31,000-square-foot open space along Brookline Avenue called the \u201cMain Heart\u201d and a central connector between the two commercial buildings including water features, public art, and range of seating.AdvertisementThe site currently holds 13 Simmons buildings that are \u201cgenerally in fair to poor condition,\u201d the Planning Department filing states, including dormitories, dining and athletic facilities, and two surface parking lots.

        "content": "By Talia Lissauer, The Boston Globe\n\n\nThe sole surviving residence fully designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany is up for sale in Back Bay for $11.5 million, alisting for the propertysaid.\n\nThe nearly 15,000 square foot mansion at 395 Commonwealth Ave. was designated a national historic landmark in 2005 and was originally commissioned by textile magnate Frederick Ayer and his wife. They lived there until Ayer died in 1918 and the property was used for a variety of purposes throughout the 1900s.\n\nAyer, alongside his brother, owned the Tremont and Suffolk Mills and the American Woolen Company, which owned 60 mills in New England,according to the Lowell Cemetery, where he is buried. He made the majority of his fortune while living in Lowell before moving to Boston. His home in Lowell became an orphanage and then the Franco-American School which operated until 2016.\n\n\nCompleted in 1902, the Ayer Mansion is the last standing home featuring handiwork both inside and out by famed designer Tiffany, the listing said. Tiffany, the son of Charles Lewis Tiffany, the founder of Tiffany & Co., made a name for himself as an artist and designer with his work with stained glass.\n\nTiffany grew up in New York City,but his art took him to North America, Europe and North Africa,according to Tiffany & Co. He started out as a painter but quickly discovered his love for stained glass and glass mosaics, and his work would end up in building lobbies, banks, hospitals, department stores and hotels.\n\nHis work was often inspired by the nature around him \u2014 dragonflies, grapevine and flowers \u2014 and he mixed metals, enamels and colored gemstones to create his pieces. In 1902, he was appointed Tiffany & Co.\u2019s art director, where he established the Tiffany Art Jewelry department for the Fifth Avenue store, and, two years later, his jewelry debuted at the St. Louis Exposition.\n\nNow known as the Ayer Mansion, the now single-family home has 23 bedrooms and 12 baths throughout its five stories, and also features rooftop panoramic views of Back Bay and the Boston skyline. There are five fireplaces throughout the townhouse and it has four parking spaces.\n\n\nThe unique design is seen in its granite facade with mosaic panels, arched ceilings, and its hand-laid Tiffany tiles and stained glass throughout the entire home.\n\n\u201cTiffany combined exotic architectural style with masterful design elements to create a museum-quality masterpiece that is just as unique now as it was at its unveiling at the turn of the 20th century,\u201d the listing said.\n\nWhile its landmark designation can make renovations difficult, it has undergone restoration renovations and is already \u201cwidely regarded as one of the most stunning and distinctive addresses on Commonwealth Avenue in Back Bay,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nLocated in the heart of Back Bay, it\u2019s a short walk to Newbury Street, Harvard Bridge and Fenway.\n\n\nAfter Ayer died and the estate was sold, the home transitioned to office space, a medical clinic, and the headquarters of an insurance company. In 1964, the Trimount Foundation, Inc., formally known as the Association of Cultural Interchange, Inc., turned it into a female students\u2019 dormitory until December 2021, when it was purchased by 395-399 Commonwealth Avenue LLC in an off-the-market sale.\n\nIt was listedback in May of 2022 for $17 millionand was reduced to $14,995,000 after a price drop in November of that year as they continued to seek a private buyer for the home. The listing was removed in April 2024 and returned as the current listing Feb. 24.\n\nThe Ayer Mansion is listed by Tracy Campion ofCampion & Company Fine Homes Real Estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBe civil.

Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland also had some of the biggest year-over-year declines in active listings, pointing to a growing rift between buyer demand and seller supply.\nThese cities\u2019 turbo-charged housing markets are in stark contrast with the country at large, which saw a scant 3.2% growth in median home prices over the same time period.\nThe country\u2019s broader housing market appears to be cooling somewhat. Homes are selling at the slowest pace in five years, Redfin reported. Pending sales saw their biggest decline since 2023 and active listings rose to their highest level since the early days of the pandemic.\n\u201cSome homes are attracting bidding wars like it\u2019s 2020 again, while others are sitting on the market for weeks with no action,\u201d Desiree Bourgeois, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Detroit, says in the report.\nIn stark contract to the Midwest cohort, home prices in Austin, Tampa and San Antonio fell the most \u2014 particularly in Austin, where a home-building boom is beginning to pay off. In Tampa, the picture is less rosy. Sky-high housing costs and untenable insurance rates have led to a pile-up of housing stock.\nUnfortunately for Milwaukeeans, there\u2019s little relief in renting.\nEarly 2025 data revealed that these same Midwestern cities are alsoamong the country\u2019s most competitive rental marketsright now. And while the Midwest remains relatively affordable \u2014 Detroit claims the lowest median sale price of any major metro \u2014 housing inventory is just not keeping up.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Living in the Hamptons is far from cheap \u2014 and now, in Montauk, a glam 1,200-square-foot trailer has listed for $1.19 million.\nOffering a front-row seat to the Atlantic Ocean and a glimpse into the evolving landscape of one of the Hamptons\u2019 most surprisingly exclusive enclaves, this residence \u2014 whose exterior marketing images show a tidy-looking mobile home \u2014 is the only four-bedroom unit in the Montauk Shores community.\nIt may seem to be a no-frills trailer park, but make no mistake \u2014 Montauk Shores has become home to a roster of ultra-wealthy homeowners, if not billionaires.\nBuilt in 1986, this residence, which has 1.5 bathrooms, has marble countertops, a spacious deck and an outdoor shower.\n\u201cIt sits there all by itself \u2026 This\u00a0home is very, very private,\u201d Susan Ceslow of Douglas Elliman who holds the listing, told The Post.\nCeslow sold this very unit to the current owners, a family, back in 2016 for $460,000.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just kind of now looking for something bigger,\u201d she said.\nWhile it\u2019s a steal compared to the Hamptons\u2019 multimillion-dollar estates, the listing underscores a seismic shift in this trailer park, where prices have soared over the past decade \u2014 turning a once-humble retreat into a warm-weather playground for the wealthy.\n\u201cEverybody just loves being there in the park,\u201d Ceslow said. \u201cOne of the things I love about it is for all the people that are in there and their kids, they all meet and ride bikes around together and get to the playground together. And they just become lifelong friends from all over the place. It\u2019s just a fabulous park to be in.\u201d\nMontauk Shores, a 65-year-old community perched near Ditch Plains \u2014 a surfer\u2019s paradise along Long Island\u2019s East End \u2014 has quietly shed its working-class roots.\nToday, it\u2019s a patchwork of 199 homes, ranging from weathered trailers to polished modular units, spread across 152 owned lots and 47 leased sites.\nThis $1.19 million trailer, an end unit with no immediate neighbors, sits on a leased site, meaning no property taxes, but a cash-only purchase \u2014 and no mortgages allowed.\nResidents enjoy a heated pool, a children\u2019s playground, a basketball court and a clubhouse, perks that amplify its allure. Yet this listing is just the latest marker in a decade-long ascent that has redefined the neighborhood\u2019s identity.\nTen years ago, such a price tag would have been unthinkable. Ken Hilderbrandt, a jet-ski rental business owner, recalled buying a dilapidated trailer in Montauk Shores in 1998 for $96,500 after scoffing at the initial $150,000 ask.\n\u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019 It was old. It needed to be gutted,\u201dhe previously told The Post. A decade later, he replaced it with a two-bedroom, two-bathroom modular home, investing $100,000 in upgrades like a wraparound porch and laminate floors.\nNow, he estimates it could fetch $60,000 as a three-month summer rental \u2014 or $5 million if he ever sold.\n\u201cBack then, you could rent them for $50 a month,\u201d he said, reflecting on a time when the community catered to surfers and locals, not a moneyed elite.\nThe turning point came in the 2010s, as deep-pocketed buyers began eyeing Montauk Shores\u2019 unbeatable location.\nIn 2022, a trailer sold for $1.85 million, then a community record. That benchmark was shattered in 2023 when an 800-square-foot oceanfront unitfetched $3.75 millionoff-market, as The Post reported at that time.\u00a0That record still stands.\nIn June 2024,another trailer listedfor $3.2 million, still unsold, while a 2,150-square-foot property brieflytested the watersat $4.4 million before retreating from the market.\nThese sales reflect a frenzy fueled by boldfaced names \u2014 Vitaminwater co-founder J. Darius Bikoff, hedge-fund titan Dan Loeb and film producer Karen Lauder have all staked claims here.\nJimmy Buffett once vied for a $430,000 trailer in 2005, losing out to caterer Janet O\u2019Brien, who outbid him.\n\u201cIt overlooks the break right there!\u201d O\u2019Brien told New York Magazine, touting its investment potential. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s waterfront!

But I\u2019d say, for the most part, it\u2019s probably more of a summer second getaway.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The crowdfunding entrepreneur who snapped up Kanye West\u2019s abandoned beachfront bunker has put it back on the market.\nWest\u2019s former Malibu retreat, designed by renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando, made headlines after the controversial rapper left it gutted and vacant.\nThe architectural gem was a literal shell of its former self whenBelwood Investmentssnapped it up last August for under $22 million \u2014 amounting to a loss of more than $36 million for West. Now, mid-renovation, Belwood\u2019s CEO Bo Belmont wants to sell,the Wall Street Journal reported.\nWest, who had his legal name changed to \u201cYe,\u201dbought the property in 2021for $57.25 million from the financier and art collector Richard Sachs, for whom the home was built in 2013. Kanye told a laborer that he planned to make the home his \u201cbomb shelter,\u201d or \u201cbat cave,\u201dthe New Yorker reported.\nWest\u2019s teardown job occurred around the same time that his erratic behavior and antisemitic outburstsmade increasingly frequent headlines, and got him cut off from lucrative deals with Gap and Adidas.\nThe home, built in 2013, spans 4,000 square feet, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms. The concrete, box-like structure stands on 12 caissons submerged 60 feet into the bedrock of the coast. Its former ocean views turned into ocean exposures after Yestripped the homeof its windows, marble bathrooms and electricity.\nWest listed the hollowed-out home for $53 million in December 2023. The price plummeted to $39 million beforeBelmont scooped it.\nRestoration of the rare Ando home is in full swing, the Journal reported. Framing, plumbing, roofing and electrical work have all been undertaken by Belmont, with the guidance of architecture firm Marmol Radziner. New windows are still in route, however. Belmont told the Journal that renovation costs will likely add up to $8.5 million.\nBut windows or no, Belmont is looking for an exit. The Journal reported this week on the CEO\u2019s plans to relist the home for $39 million, as is.\nBelmont told the Journal that selling now is a way to recoup his investors \u2014 whose crowdfunded contributions range from $1,000 to $1 million \u2014 as soon as possible. Belmont said carrying the property currently costs him about $1 million a month.\nThe home miraculouslysurvived the massive wildfiresthat scorched entire neighborhoods across Los Angeles in January. Belmont told the Journal that the fires may even increase the home\u2019s value, due tothe destruction of so much inventoryalong the Pacific Coast Highway.\nIf no one bites, Belmont plans to try again once the restoration is closer to completion in early 2026 \u2014 with a much higher price, of course, in the range of $55 to $65 million.\nThe Pritzker Prize-winning Ando\u2019s residential designs are rare and iconic, and they always go from millions, froma Lenox Hill penthouseto Beyonce and Jay-Z\u2019srecord-setting Malibu mansion. His work has been panned for being parking garage-esque, but others praise his modernist creations as sculptural works of art, including Belmont.\nThe Oppenheim Group, which represented West in his 2024 sale, holds the new listing.\nAdvertisement",

The Post has reached out to Goodman\u2019s reps for comment.\nIn a 2014\u00a0Garden & Gun\u00a0interview, he explained his initial move: \u201cI kind of had it with show business.\u201d\nHe and his wife had considered a certain Midwest hub \u2014 near his Missouri roots \u2014 before opting for Louisiana.\n\u201cThe options were St. Louis or New Orleans.

        "hed": "Amid development slowdown, one City Councilor wonders how much affordable housing is too much?",
        "subhead": "Chief Planner Kairos Shen emphasized Boston is not considering a wholesale change to its inclusionary development requirement",
        "content": "Housing affordability once again was a topic of debate at City Hall on Tuesday, with City Councilor Ed Flynn suggesting the Planning Department loosen requirements for developers to set aside affordable units in new housing projects.Boston Planning Chief Kairos Shen testified to a City Council hearing on the ongoing transition from the Boston Planning and Development Agency into the Boston Planning Department. The hearing ran for nearly three and a half hours and saw Shen and his top deputies answering questions from eight Boston councilors.District 2 Councilor Ed Flynn asked Shen about the city\u2019s affordability requirements in housing developments, which Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration has increased. For housing projects with more than 7 units, the city now requires developers set aside 17 percent of the project\u2019s square footage for affordable units, with another 3 percent set aside for tenants using Section 8 and other rental vouchers.\u201cI think it\u2019s time to revisit that percent, especially during challenging economic times, maybe for a period of five years,\u201d Flynn said Tuesday.AdvertisementIt\u2019s a somewhat wonky topic that has taken center stage in this fall\u2019s mayoral race. Wu campaigned four years ago on increasing the city\u2019s affordability requirement from 13 percent to 20 percent, and exploring the change was among the first steps she took upon assuming office in late 2021. It formally took effect in October. Challenger Josh Kraft calls for reverting back to a 13 percent requirement, to help reverse a slowdown in new construction amid higher interest rates and materials costs.Related: As Wu, Kraft, gear up for campaign, it's clear that housing will be a big issue in this year's mayor's race.Since its introduction, developers in the commercial real estate industry have vociferously protested the increase, contending that steeper affordability requirements would make projects economically infeasible. Shen\u2019s predecessor, Arthur Jemison, had suggested the agency could reevaluate boosting IDP requirements should the difficult economic environment continue.Shen on Tuesday said that, when he returned to City Hall last year to take the job of Chief Planner, Wu asked him to explore how the Planning Department can get more approved projects into construction. A number of developers with approved projects have suggested that the city easing affordability requirements \u201cwould potentially make their projects more viable,\u201d Shen said.Advertisement\u201cWe have not had any specific requests, and if there was or if there will be, it is my job to make sure that this administration considers it,\u201d Shen said Tuesday. \u201cThe one thing we have learned is that there is no blanket programmatic change to the inclusionary development requirement that we are considering at this stage.\u201dSome on the City Council worry that loosening affordable housing requirements could usher in a wave of displacement in quickly-changing neighborhoods like East Boston.Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffHowever, given the current economic climate and high cost of construction, Shen said lowering affordability requirements would likely not spur a flood of groundbreakings. And he emphasized that, with the Planning Department now a city department and no longer a quasi-independent agency, the Planning Department would not make any changes without consulting Wu and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing.\u201cThese are not decisions isolated from our colleagues who have expertise and knowledge,\u201d Shen said. \u201cThe administration is not considering a blanket relief or reconsideration of the inclusionary development requirement that is in place right now.\u201d\u201cMore case by case,\u201d Flynn added.\u201cYes, but as I said, the criteria is based on what the specific hurdles of a particular project is. Where it\u2019s located ... who are the beneficiaries, which community and physical location, all of those things would come into play,\u201d Shen said.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why does it cost so much to build in Boston?District 1 Councilor Gabriela Coletta Zapata, who chairs the council\u2019s government operations committee, said any hint of the administration moving away from the current 20 percent inclusionary development requirement should prompt a larger conversation among the council.\u201cThat would have huge ramifications for our city,\u201d she said. \u201cNeighborhoods like East Boston remember what life was like under a 13 percent IDP policy, and it\u2019s a movie we\u2019ve already seen before. Guess what? The affordability did not trickle down. My neighbors and elementary school cohorts that have now been displaced could not afford those luxury units, and they were ultimately displaced.AdvertisementCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

It\u2019s all about housing.\u201d\nBut perhaps the most important lesson is also the simplest: Let people know they\u2019re wanted.\n\u201cI overheard someone say, \u2018Who wants to come back to Pawnee City?\u2019\u201d Glenn recalls.\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to make it so we put the welcome mat out. You\u2019d be surprised how many people will come if we just say \u2018welcome.\u2019\u201d\nIf you\u2019re curious about making the move to Pawnee City, or just want to learn more about the homes and incentives available, you can visitpawneecitynewhomes.comto view floor plans, pricing, and project updates.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "\nMichael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones\u2019former home is now up for grabs.\nThe Los Angeles home, which once belonged to the Hollywood power couple, is now for sale with a price tag of $7 million in partnership with listing agents Alphonso Lascano and Bjorn Farrugia of Carolwood Estates.\nAccording to The Robb Report, the couple purchased two condos near each other in the late 1990s, and after combining the two units to create one large one, sold the home to its current owners, Judy Glickman Lauder and her husband, Leonard Lauder, the son of beauty mogul Est\u00e9e Lauder.\nThey purchased the home from Douglas and Zeta-Jones in 2003 and, after more than a decade, have decided to put it on the market.\n\u201cA living piece of Hollywood history, this home still reflects the timeless taste and style of its original celebrity owners, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, down to the last detail,\u201d Lascano told FOX Business in a statement.\nThe home is found on the 23rd floor in one of the two buildings that make up the Century Towers, which have housed many of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, including Diana Ross, Burt Lancaster and others.\nEncompassing 2,640 square feet,the home consists ofthree bedrooms and three bathrooms. The home\u2019s open floor plan allows for easy access to all the communal areas of the home, including the spacious living room.\n\u201cWalking into the residence, I was immediately drawn to the Old Hollywood glamour and the architectural details crafted by renowned architect I. M. Pei\u2014an icon of his time, who redefined luxury in Los Angeles,\u201d Farrugia said in a statement.\nA key highlight of the room is the floor-to-ceiling windows that line the room, providing picturesque views of the city. The room also consists of light carpet flooring, brown sofas and armchairs, wooden coffee tables and end tables, as well as a unique light fixture and artwork on the walls.\nJust steps away from the living room is the kitchen, which boasts tiled floors, dark wooden cabinets and dark countertops in addition to a breakfast bar for casual dining.\nIn addition, the kitchen also features many top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, including an oven, dishwasher, microwave and sink.\nConnected to the kitchen is theformal dining area, with enough space for a table fit for six diners. Behind the table is a wooden wall with a section carved out, creating space for glass shelves which can store dishes or decor. Below the shelves is a small drinks fridge.\nOne of the wooden panels connected to the shelves slides open to reveal a dedicated laundry room with a washer and dryer.\nAttached to the kitchen and dining room is the enviable family room, which is lined by floor-to-ceiling windows on one side, similar to the living room. In addition to stunning views of the city, the family room boasts a large flat-screen TV placed in a sizable wooden entertainment center, as well as a stone counter running along the entire length of the window.\nAcross from the television is a good-sized cozy sectional sofa, perfect for hosting a movie night with friends or just a casual night in with family.\nElsewhere in the home is the luxurious primary bedroom. One of the main features of the bedroom is the layered built-in shelving above the bed, which currently holds rows of picture frames.\nThe room also boasts one big floor-to-ceiling window lining the far wall, which also leads out to its own private outdoor seating area. In addition to a bed, the carpeted room is also large enough to house an additional indoor seating space.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A unit in the late Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid\u2019s only New York City building is on sale, asking $3.7 million, according to a StreetEasy listing update.\nThe eye-catching 11-story luxury condo is located at 520 W. 28th St., right along the picturesque High Line.\nThe building, built by Related Companies, was among Hadid\u2019s final creations. She died of a heart attack at age 65 in March 2016, more than a year before construction was completed.\u00a0She was the first woman to win that prestigious architectural prize.\nPulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic and author Paul Goldberger, who penneda tribute to Hadid in Vanity Fairfollowing her 2016 death, described her as an ardent feminist with a commanding personality and uncompromising vision.\n\u201cShe really had become far and away the most prominent woman architect in the world, and I think [she] took a lot of pride in that,\u201d Goldberger told The Post of Hadid, who was Iraqi-British.\nNow, a piece of this boundary-breaking architect\u2019s artful legacy can belong to someone new.\nThe 1,691-square-foot unit is the only one on its floor, according to its Compass listing. It includes five rooms, with two bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. The home boasts 50 feet of floor-to-ceiling motorized, sculptural windows overlooking 28th Street.\nThe West Chelsea apartment\u2019s current owner is a woman named Rabia Kamani, according to city records. She appears to be the sister of Mahmud Abdullah Kamani, the co-founder and executive chairman of BooHoo Group. BooHoo Group owns pretty much every fast fashion brand in the UK, including PrettyLittleThing.\nThe well-heeled residents at the 40-unit condominium enjoy a private IMAX theater, a terrace on the High Line, a 75-foot swimming pool, a gym, a spa and more.\nIn an interview with Alexagiven three days before her death, Hadid said she designed the West Chelsea building as an \u201cextension of the pavement.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought the building should have a connection to the High Line,\u201d she told Alexa. \u201cIt should project out, make some sort of gesture. When you have a neighborhood that is quite fresh and new, it can give you certain freedom to do new things.\u201d\nFreedom defined Hadid\u2019s philosophy and designs, which mixed bold lines and fluid curves into futuristic, organic structures.\n\u201cI think the story of the building is a story of trying to somehow combine Zaha Hadid\u2019s interest in unusual shapes \u2014 sharp angles and unexpected curves and swoops and things like that \u2014 with the practical needs of a New York condominium,\u201d Goldberger added. \u201cI always thought they did actually quite well with that. It\u2019s a very strong building, but it\u2019s also a very normal, livable building.\u201d\nThe condominium currently has two other units on the market. A similar two-bedroom unit listed more than 200 days ago, according to StreetEasy, for $3.85 million. A larger three-bedroom unit came on the market for $8.8 million in February.\nRelated Companies\u2019 big investment initially struggled to sell in its early years. Sales opened up in 2015 and seemed to stall out in 2019 at less than 50% of capacity,Crain\u2019s reported.\nBut the building still earned notable residents in these early days. Sting and Trudie Styler wereearly rentersthere. American businessman Wes Edens scored a 6,853-square-foot penthouse for $20 million in 2020 \u2014$30 million below the asking price, and Ariana Grandesold her five-bedroom condothere for $12 million in 2021.\nGoldberger described the construction of 520 W. 28th St. as a big investment by Related Companies, and a big risk.\n\u201cCommercial developers and builders in New York aren\u2019t always very adventurous,\u201d Goldberger said. \u201cAnd I think [Hadid] was viewed as somewhat difficult and demanding, which she was, even though she was also a brilliant architect.\u201d\nRelated Companies undertook this project and the construction of nearby Hudson Yards around the same time.\n\u201cI think it was really more of a showpiece, to show that they could do other things as well as build huge skyscrapers and Hudson Yards,\u201d Goldberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Related made a lot of money from it, but it\u2019s an admired building, and people like to live in it.\u201d\nCompass reps Michael Rubin and Todd Lewin, who hold the listing, could not be reached for comment before press time.\nIt is difficult to imagine that this condominium would have been Hadid\u2019s only contribution to the city if she had lived. Her architectural firm grew rapidly alongside her personal fame in the final years of her life.\n\u201cShe was a remarkable person, and it was a real loss for architecture,\u201d said Goldberger. \u201cIt was also a loss for New York, because who knows what else might have happened, had she lived.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s when he was among four appointees ousted amid security clearance disputes, as reported by the Washington Post.\nGarcia has contested that account, but couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nSince leaving public office, Garcia has carved a lucrative path.\nHe registered as a lobbyist with the Livingston Group in 2019 and 2020, then co-founded Health Supply US with his father during the pandemic.\nThe firm has secured $179 million in federal contracts, predominantly with the Defense Department, including $51 million earmarked for COVID-19 relief, per public records. Lobbying disclosures show the company has spent $1.25 million on advocacy since 2021.\nGarcia\u2019s property portfolio extends beyond Virginia. He and his wife own a $1.64 million home in Washington, DC, purchased in 2021, and another in North Carolina, property records show.\nThe transaction was brokered by Robert Crawford and Tyler Jeffrey of TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty for Vance, with Justin Tanner of Re/Max Allegiance representing Garcia. Tanner did not respond to inquiries seeking comment.",

        "content": "A unit in a Bronx co-op once described bythe New York Timesas \u201ca fantasy sand castle for the Amalfi coast designed by M.C. Escher\u201d is back on the market \u2014 as its community is in the midst of turning over to younger generations.\nThe $1.31 million listing within Spuyten Duyvil\u2019s storied Villa Charlotte Bronte spans 1,996 feet across three floors. Perched atop a cliff overlooking the Hudson River, the 17-unit co-op indeed looks like it belongs in a coastal Tuscan village, rather than The Bronx.\nUnits at Villa Charlotte Bronte havea reputation for rarely changing hands, but a recent uptick in sales shows a generational turnover is occurring at the exclusive enclave.\nThe property\u2019s ivy-wrapped exteriors and leafy grounds \u2014 including a cave-like spot called the grotto \u2014 attracts plenty of attention from neighbors and tourists alike.\nThe three-bed, 2.5-bath home includes sweeping views of the Hudson River and the Palisades. The listing boasts woodburning fireplaces, a large stone patio and an oversized eat-in kitchen with ample wood cabinetry.\nOwners pay $2,147 in monthly maintenance fees.\nUnits in this transportive riverside retreat rarely listed in the past, but sales have increased over the last year. One unit found a buyer for $915,000 in January and four others sold in 2024, according to records.\nDouglas Elliman agent Ari Susswein, who holds the current listing, said the recent uptick is a part of a generational turnover.\nSusswein said recent sales have been a change of hands between older residents and \u201ca lot of young, new families moving in.\u201d\nThe current listing was snapped up as recently as last summer, when the current owners purchased the home for $1.2 million. The owners made around $65,000 in improvements, Susswein said, including new carpets and window treatments, but are now choosing to move for family considerations.\nSusswein described Villa Charlotte Bronte as \u201ca real tight knit community.\u201d\nThese standout homes were originally built in 1926, when the area was still largely farmland. The developer, a lawyer named John Jay McKelvey, was inspired by European architecture, and reportedly found the rest of the city distasteful.\u00a0OneLehman College professor called the property\u201cprobably the most determinedly picturesque set of buildings\u201d in The Bronx.\nVilla Charlotte Bronte is visible from the Metro-North and Amtrak trains, the former of which has a stop in Spuyten Duyvil.\u00a0 The downside of frequent train horns and unwanted tourists is, however, balanced out by the rare opportunity of countryside living just 20 minutes from Grand Central Station.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The late, great Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s sprawling mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut traded hands this week, fetching $16.9 million in a deal that closed on Tuesday, according to a press release from its listing brokerage.\nThe new was first reported byGreenwich Time.\nThe sale marks the end of a nearly two-year effort by Moore\u2019s widower, S. Robert Levine, to part with the property, which helisted in September 2023for $21.9 million. The sale price marks the property\u2019s most recent asking price.\nThe transaction went under contract last month, as The Postfirst reported.\nThe couple purchased the Georgian Colonial-style home, constructed in 1900, in 2006 through a limited liability company for $9 million, according to property records.\nThe estate, which boasts a stone facade, stretches across more than 13,800 square feet and sits on a lush 7-acre lot.\nThe primary suite alone encompasses more than 2,000 square feet, complete with dual bathrooms, dressing areas and ample closet space.\nIn sum, the residence includes five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two powder rooms.\nLuxury abounds in the home\u2019s features, which include a glass-walled conservatory, an elevator \u2014 and a fitness center equipped with a hot tub, a steam shower and a sauna.\nOutdoors, a 65-foot swimming pool flanked by an outdoor fireplace complements a serene pond at the rear of the property.\nAbove the three-car garage, a separate one-bedroom apartment offers its own kitchen and bathroom.\nMoore, who passed away in 2017 at the age of 80, left an indelible mark on entertainment, most notably through her starring role in \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d a 1970s sitcom that earned her four of her seven Emmy Awards.\nHer cinematic turn in the 1980 drama \u201cOrdinary People\u201d also rewarded her with an Oscar nomination.\nLevine could not be reached for comment on the sale.\nThe home was brokered by Joseph Barbieri of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who acted on Levine\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cIt was an honor to represent this remarkable property, once home to a beloved TV icon,\u201d Barbieri said in a statement.\nThe buyer, shielded by an LLC in local records, was represented by Helene Barre and Fran Ehrlich, also of Sotheby\u2019s.\nNeither Barre nor Ehrlich were available to comment, and representatives for the purchaser could not immediately be contacted.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The Chelsea co-op where renowned \u201cFame\u201d choreographer Louis Falco rehearsed and threw legendary Studio 54 afterparties is on the market for $4.4 million.\nThe 4,200-square-foot home spans two floors of the seven-story co-op, with temporary walls that can be reconfigured into endless arrangements. The sprawling loft, constructed in 1901, is notable not only for its colorful history, but also its soaring 18-foot ceilings with large, south-facing windows at the core of the home.\n\u201cLight just pours in all day,\u201d said Matthew Solomon at Compass, who holds the listing.\nCurrently, there are four bedrooms and three full bathrooms, but that could easily be changed. None of the walls in the home are structural, Solomon said, so the space is fully customizable.\nWhen the current owners bought it in the early 2000s, Solomon said, it was completely open, and used as a dance studio.\nThere\u2019s elevator access to both floors, the second of which features a catwalk that connects the south-facing kitchen to a library and two bedrooms.\nThe blank-canvas residence could be repurposed as a dance studio, a creative space or a grand loft home.\nThe large loft served as both a living space and rehearsal studio for Falco, who famously choreographed that groundbreaking 1980 movie. Falco, a New York native born to southern Italian immigrants, achieved international acclaim during his career as a modern dance choreographer. His life was cut short by AIDS in 1993, at the age of 50.\n\u201cI think my works were gutsy,\u201d Flacoonce told an interviewer. \u201cIt comes from growing up on the Lower East Side.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Mayor Michelle Wu is hoping dorms might spark more office-to-residential conversions in downtown Boston to help fill up empty buildings and alleviate the city\u2019s housing shortage.During her state of the city address last week, Wu mentioned she would expand her existing conversion program to include developers that build dorms for students or workers. The general reaction in Boston\u2019s real estate sector: Every little bit helps, especially when construction has begun on only one conversion project so far.Wu first launched the program in 2023, offering significant property tax breaks over nearly 30 years to developers willing to convert downtown office buildings to apartments. The goal was to rescue older buildings and bring more foot traffic into a part of the city that still hasn\u2019t rebounded to pre-COVID levels, where around one-quarter of the office space remains empty. Last year, the Healey administration pitched in, by promising up to $15 million in state funding for Boston to help jump-start particularly significant conversions.Related: Want to live in a converted office tower? Boston has high hopes for its high rises.AdvertisementWith the new dorm concept, for college students or \u201cmiddle income\u201d workers, Wu adds yet another incentive: a way around a city requirement that 20 percent of all housing units in a particular project be set aside at a more affordable cost. This city requirement, known as Inclusionary Zoning, already doesn\u2019t apply to student dorms, and the Wu administration would waive it for developers that build employer-sponsored housing. (The affordable requirement would remain in place for other conversion projects.)In an interview the day after her speech, Wu explained that the dorm expansion could open up buildings whose footprints wouldn\u2019t quite work for splitting into traditional full-scale apartments but might work for dorms with some shared facilities, such as kitchens or bathrooms.One scenario that city officials have floated: encouraging developers to bring together multiple smaller schools willing to share a building with each other.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some conversations with smaller colleges and universities who might not have had the scale to do this across the entire building themselves,\u201d Wu said, \u201cbut would be interested in joining together with others in a consortium that would together master-lease a building from a private developer.\u201dAdvertisementAlthough only one project has begun, a conversion to build 15 apartments at 281 Franklin St., Wu and others in her administration say they consider the program to be a success so far. They point to the fact that 15 applications have been filed, with the potential to convert 20 office buildings into nearly 800 housing units. Seven of the applicants have been approved by the Boston Planning & Development Agency board, giving the green light for more than 350 units; city officials expect up to 200 units to be under construction by sometime this summer.\u201cOur goal has been to do everything possible to drive the commercial vacancy rate down, and to boost more housing throughout the city,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThis program does both. [But] it really takes a unique combination of factors to make this work between the financial status of the building, the valuation of it, the vacancy rates, and also the physical layout.\u201dBoston Mayor Michelle Wu delivers the State of the City address at MGM Music Hall on March 19.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeA city spokesperson said the state has already made $7.5 million available of the $15 million promised to the city of Boston for subsidizing conversions, though none of that has been awarded yet. City officials, she said, are also willing to consider including conversions in the program that are outside the core downtown area.Suffolk University\u2019s conversion of an 11-story office building on Tremont Street, with the Beantown Pub on the ground floor, gets widely cited as an example of how some older structures could be repurposed under the expanded conversion program. That project is underway, although the pub isn\u2019t going anywhere. Suffolk is not participating in the city\u2019s program because the university wasn\u2019t interested in a master lease arrangement and preferred to buy the building on its own. (As a nonprofit, the university doesn\u2019t pay property taxes on dorms.)Related: BPDA approves Suffolk University\u2019s proposal to convert Beantown Pub building into dormsAdvertisementBusiness groups, including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce and developer association NAIOP Massachusetts, expressed cautious optimism about the program\u2019s expansion. To Michael Nichols and the organization he leads, the Downtown Boston Alliance, the embrace of college and workforce dorms fits with his group\u2019s view that city officials should take an \u201can office-to-everything\u201d approach to repurposing these underused buildings \u2014 that is, not just turning them into luxury apartments.Several factors get cited for why Boston has lagged other major US cities in office-to-residential conversions lately. They include high construction and property costs along with the city\u2019s aggressive affordable housing and clean-energy requirements. A new downtown zoning change under consideration at City Hall could usher in more units, by allowing taller buildings in certain areas.Bryan Montgomery, a researcher with brokerage giant JLL, said some of these projects probably haven\u2019t started because their costs changed materially during the permitting process. After six to 12 months go by, the math may no longer add up.\u201cThey\u2019ve tried their best to expedite the permitting,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s a fine line between actually putting these programs in place and making them streamlined in a way that allows folks to act with conviction.\u201dDeveloper Joey Chilelli has been watching the process unfold from New York. His firm, Vanbarton Group, has already been involved in several big conversions in its home city, and he has been eyeing an expansion to Boston. The prices for downtown buildings in Boston, he said, simply haven\u2019t fallen far enough for projects to pencil out for him yet. He said it\u2019s smart for Boston officials to expand the program, potentially to create housing for university faculty or another sector that needs to accommodate its workforce.Advertisement\u201cI do believe we will start to see a lot more of these\u201d conversions in Boston, Chilelli said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s on the cusp.\u201dSynergy chief executive David Greaney, whose firm owns several downtown Boston buildings, said the affordable housing requirement makes it tougher to make the numbers work. Wu\u2019s expansion, at least, offers a workaround.\u201cThat is a step in the right direction,\u201d Greaney said, \u201cand may help deals pencil out better than they are currently penciling out.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

Nearby is Newburyport\u2019s bustling downtown filled with restaurants and shops, plus the beach is close for the warm days ahead.\n\nThis home has its own wide red brick walkway. It leads to an equally wide set of six stairs that ends at a covered porch that stretches around to the left side of the home.\n\nThe double-wide front door opens into a 25-foot-long hallway with the living spaces on the first floor of this 4,201-square-foot home. At the end of the hallway is a set of stairs to the second floor.\n\nGiven its age \u2014 it was built in 1879 \u2014 this house has separate rooms, not an open floor plan. But as an ode to its history, many rooms have pocket doors and fireplaces. The home has central air conditioning and forced hot air gas heating.\n\n\nTo the right off the main hallway is the 180-square-foot dining room with large windows on two exterior walls and a hardwood floor. The interior wall is lined with built-in shelving that is formed around a white fireplace, one of five in the home. A circular light fixture is positioned above the eight-person table.\n\nAcross the hall is the 287-square-foot living room with three large windows on its exterior walls. There is also its version of built-in shelving and fireplace. In this iteration, the mantle is wood painted white and the firebox is framed by brick.\n\n\nReturning to the hallway and heading deeper into the home, the 347-square-foot kitchen emerges on the left. The room is large enough to host a small circular table for four that is positioned near the third fireplace with a wooden mantle.\n\n\n\nThe working area of the kitchen is on the left side defined by a large island with white cabinetry and arainforest greengranite top with seating for three. It\u2019s something like an alcove, lined on all sides by cabinets (some with clear glass doors), the sink, stainless steel appliances (including gas stove), and a white subway tile backsplash.\n\nThe rear exterior wall has two large double-hung windows and a windowed door leading to the 219-square-foot rear deck.\n\n\nA short hallway leads to an 18-square-foot half bath with a porcelain pedestal sink, hardwood flooring, andNantucket Beadboard. Through another doorway is the 218-square-foot family room, which features its own fireplace, crown molding, and hardwood flooring. There are two windows on the exterior walls.\n\nThe primary suite occupies roughly half of the entire second floor. The 316-square-foot bedroom has its own fireplace, wide-planked hardwood flooring, four double-hung windows, and a coffered ceiling.\n\n\nFor a closet, there\u2019s a 158-square-foot dressing room with an island and a three-windowed bump-out and built-in shelving. There is also a walk-in closet. The 75-square-foot private bath has a single vanity with arainforest browntop, a bathtub underneath a window, and a shower stall with a clear glass door and subway tile backsplash. The flooring is porcelain tile.\n\n\nNestled under the stairwell to the third floor is an 18-foot hallway hosting the full-size laundry area. There\u2019s an added attraction: A door opens to a 49-square-foot balcony with views of the backyard.\n\nThis level has two bedrooms (204 and 244 square feet) that share a 32-square-foot full bath.\n\nThe third floor has the final two bedrooms, which are 176 and 187 square feet. There also is a 212-square-foot room without a closet that could be used as a bedroom. This floor has a shower-only bath with a single vanity topped by granite, Nantucket Beadboard on the ceiling and walls, and porcelain tile flooring.\n\n\nThe 536-square-foot apartment is in the basement and has a private entrance It includes sitting, living, and bedroom areas, and an 84-square-foot bathroom. The bath has porcelain tile flooring, a mahogany-toned vanity, and a shower with clear glass walls and porcelain tile flooring and backsplash.\n\n\nAlso in the basement is a home gym and a storage area.\n\nThe listing agent,Andrea M. O\u2019Reillyof Keller Williams Realty Evolution, said the current owners have rented the apartment through Airbnb, earning $22,000 over one year.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nIt\u2019s official: Spring has finally arrived! The spring peepers in the marsh behind my house have confirmed it by beginning their evening chorus last week.\n\nWith winter in the rearview mirror, it is tempting to forget about the cold and snow and move toward sunny skies, warm sunshine, and fresh new green growth. Crocus are blooming, the first shoots of daffodils are up, and my snowdrops are almost past peak bloom. One of my favorite early risers in the spring is dwarf or reticulate irises (Iris reticulata). They can be found in bulb catalogs in the fall and are best planted at that time of year. Fully perennial in our climate, these dwarf irises are so charming! The species features deep blue blossoms, which appear as the foliage emerges, reaching a diminutive height of 3 to 5 inches.\n\nAnother selection from this group that adorns the sides of my back patio isIris \u2018Katharine Hodgkin\u2019, with lovely pale blue, striped, spoon-shaped petals with a yellow background and flecked with matching blue splotches. Be sure to look for these beauties in the bulb catalogs this fall.\n\n\nOut atGarden in the Woodsin Framingham, the otherworldly flowers of skunk cabbage have emerged, their appearance ranging from dark maroon to pale green with streaks, spots, and swirls of red and purple. These are easy to miss at this time of year, but worth seeking. The flower, known as a spathe and spadix, can be up to 15 degrees warmer inside than the ambient temperature, an adaptation to lure early pollinators into spending the night, thereby better guaranteeing pollination.\n\nOne of the reasons I look forward to spring is the idea that everything in the plant world is getting a fresh start at growth, the resumption of an age-old cycle of dormancy and rebirth. Sadly, some plants still bear visible signs of last year\u2019s drought and the stresses of the winter season. None show the signs of the past season more thanevergreen rhododendrons. This reader\u2019s question resonates with me, especially as I have seen the same signs on the rhododendrons at my home and in the garden.\n\nQ.I have two large rhododendron bushes in front of my house that seem to have not gotten through the winter very well. The leaves and branches on the front half of both, that face out into the front garden, appear withered and possibly dead. These plants were here and mature when I moved to this house about 25 years ago and have never done this before. My question is what could have caused this and what should I do about it? Should I prune off all the dead branches and if so, will the bush regenerate and fill back in, or do I need to give up on them? They will look rather sad once half of the plants are removed.\n\nMSM, Dedham\n\nYears ago, I attended a lecture from renowned rhododendron grower and breeder Hank Schannen at hisRareFind Nurseryin New Jersey. He explained the top 10 things to do to grow great rhododendrons, and the top eight words were drainage. With few exceptions, rhododendrons do not like consistently wet or damp soils. But, almost paradoxically, they do like water and consistent amounts of it.\n\nNatural rainfall was in rather short supply last summer and into autumn. Prolonged droughts are particularly tough on older established rhododendrons, setting them up to enter the challenges of the winter season in an already stressed state. Once the soil freezes, those large evergreen leaves become a liability, as the plant cannot replace moisture lost to winter winds if the water in the soil is still ice.\n\nRhododendrons attempt to reduce that moisture loss by causing their foliage to droop and curl inward, thereby reducing the surface area exposed. I think of them as nature\u2019s thermometer: A quick glance at their foliage can tell me if it is above or below freezing for the day. The loss of water further exacerbates their stress, resulting in entire branches, foliage, and dieback. The stress also can weaken the plants, making them susceptible to soil-borne fungal pathogens that can cause foliage wilting and branch die-offs.\n\nBut there are several steps you can take to help your rhododendrons. The first step is to prune out as much of the dead branches and foliage as possible. It is important to inspect the stems to look for signs of discoloration in the wood, a good indication that a fungal pathogen in the plant\u2019s internal plumbing is at work. Be sure to clean up all the fallen foliage as well. Rhododendrons respond well to severe pruning, although it will take years for a large shrub to reattain its former glory.\n\nIf further pruning for shape and form is needed, wait until the growing season is here, especially if the shrub still has viable flower buds. Moving forward, be sure to cover the root zone with a good layer of mulch. This helps the shrub retain water during the hotter and colder months of the year.\n\nLastly, cast ahead in the weather outlook. If we are forecast for heat waves or extended droughts, water your shrubs deeply just ahead of the hot times. We often set up a sprinkler on a timer and let it run for a few hours a night during the summer. Our veteran rhododendrons appreciate the extra care and enter into autumn and winter ready for the stresses of the season.\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

        "content": "By Jim Morrison, The Boston Globe\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough homes in Boston for everyone who wants to live here. So where are home buyers going? We asked agents in which communities buyers are most clamoring to purchase a single-family home.\n\nJoselin Malkhasian ofLamacchia Realtyworks with a lot of out-of-state buyers and has noticed a clear trend among them. When she asks what towns they think they\u2019d be interested in, the answer is very often Lexington, Newton, and Weston.\n\n\u201cThose are the three that always get mentioned,\u201d she said. \u201cTakeLexingtonfor example. There are 26 single-family homes for sale in Lexington today. The lowest-priced home is asking $1.8 million. It\u2019s very rare that there\u2019s going to be something below $1 million in Lexington, but even if you get something between $1 million and $1.5 million, it will probably only last on the market for a weekend. It is going to be a frenzy with 50 buyers at the open house. Newton and Weston are even more expensive.\u201d\n\n\nThe median sales price for a Lexington home was $2.9 million in February,according to The Warren Group, which tracks real estate data in the state. Newton was $1.8 million and Weston $1.5 million.\n\nMalkhasian also said in this post-COVID era,Hyde Park($600,000) andWest Roxbury($825,000) are popular places for buyers who want something closer to the city, but wish to have a backyard.\n\nDave Twombly is the principal broker/owner of4Buyers Real Estate. He said regardless of what is happening in the economy,Cambridge\u2014 where 14 homes sold in February at a median price of close to $2.5 million \u2014 is always a draw for those who can afford to live there.\n\n\n\u201cIn the dead of last winter, I had clients in my neighborhood make an offer on a single-family home for close to $300,000 over asking, and they got beat out by another buyer because it was a single-family house in Cambridge,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Cambridge buyers are committed to living in that city and will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to buy a home there. Other communities just aren\u2019t like that, he said.\n\nAnd the surge of the spring house hunt hasn\u2019t even begun yet.\n\n\nMalkhasian saidMelrose($771,000) is a very hot community. It\u2019s got proximity to Boston, commuter rail, good schools, and a low crime rate. But on the day she spoke to the Globe, there were only four single-family homes for sale.\n\n\u201cThe communities where inventory [are] very low is where you\u2019re going to see the crazy bidding wars and the waiving of all contingencies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re even getting properties where buyers are obtaining a mortgage but are waiving their mortgage contingency [a clause giving the buyer the right to back out of the contract and have their deposit returned if they can\u2019t secure a mortgage] in an effort to compete with cash offers.\u201d\n\n\nRich Rosa, cofounder and co-owner ofBuyers Brokers Only LLC, also singled out Melrose. \u201cMelrose has been a hot market for my home-buying clients \u2014 mostly millennial professionals \u2014 for at least a decade,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cOver that time, single-family inventory has often been in the single digits at any given time. Home buyers like the downtown, the proximity to Boston, and the access to public transportation. Multiple offers on homes in Melrose were common years before the 2020 pandemic.\u201d\n\nKevin Sexton ofWilliam Raveis Real Estatesaid he grew up in Melrose and loves the city, but in recent years the quality of the schools and other services have deteriorated while home prices and tax bills have increased. He thinksReading($951,600) has overtaken Melrose in desirability because it provides more land at a better value.\n\n\u201cPeople come to Reading from places like Cambridge, Winchester, and Arlington,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cIf they feel priced out of Reading, they used to go toAndover($795,000), but since COVID, prices there have gone through the roof. If they can\u2019t afford Reading, they move out toWilmington($675,000) and evenTewksbury($725,000). Houses in Reading and Wilmington still regularly sell for over the asking price.\u201d\n\n\nHillary Birch is withCompass Real Estate. She sells homes all over Greater Boston, but her focus in on the South Shore. She said most of her buyers fall roughly into one of two groups: People looking to be close to their work in Boston, and those looking farther out to communities with a little more land and strong schools.\n\n\n\u201cThe first group is looking atQuincy($650,000),Milton($845,000), andBraintree($654,000), but predominantly Quincy, she said. \u201cThey still want access to restaurants and the Red Line T station. The second group is OK with being a little farther from the city and is usually looking inNorwell($992,500),Hanover($645,000), and if they can afford it,Hingham($1.4 million).\u201d\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t always been the case.\n\n\u201cQuincy has gotten more expensive in recent years,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your budget is, say, $800,000, you can get a little bit more house in a nice town like Hanover than you can Quincy. The development that\u2019s happened in Quincy has elevated pricing. And people who fled the city during COVID and moved to somewhere like Plymouth, they\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\n\nDavid Bates ofWilliam Raveis Real EstatesaidArlington($1.2 million) andNeedham($1.6 million) are two popular buyer destinations west of Boston. And the numbers tell the story.\n\n\n\u201cIn Arlington, the median sale price to list price ratio in 2024 was 104.25 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2023 it was 103.45 percent, which is very good. The median number of days to offer on sold properties was just six. It\u2019s practically impossible to get lower \u2014 kind of like it\u2019s impossible to have 100 percent employment.\n\nBates said there is reason to think there is even more room for growth.\n\n\u201cArlington home prices could get a bump from new Cambridge zoning, which eliminates single-family zones,\u201d he said. \u201cArlington also borders other very good markets, like Cambridge, Winchester, and Medford. It is ahead of the game inMBTA Communities Actand ADU [Accessory Dwelling Unit] approval. It also has a really good restaurant scene.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, the median sale price of a single-family home in Needham was up $205,000 from 2023 according to MLS data, and was 101.3 percent of the asking price,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s great schools, new construction for sale, commuter rail access, and it borders some prestigious markets, like Wellesley, Newton, and Dover.\u201d\n\nJim Morrison can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].

        "content": "Russian airport billionaire Valery Kogan and his wife, Olga, have found a buyer for their extravagant gold-and-onyx condo at Manhattan\u2019s landmarked Plaza Hotel, Gimme Shelter can reveal.\nOnce asking $50 millionfollowing Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, this Plaza pad \u2014 decked out like a mini-Versailles \u2014 was last asking $23 million and is now in contract, sources said. The final sale price, as well as the new owner, are not yet known.\nThe 5,302-square-foot apartment is on the 10th floor of the famed edifice at Fifth Avenue and Central Park South. It\u2019s a combination of two units, 1007 and 1009 \u2014 and it comes with Central Park views.\nA separate one-bedroom, 782-square-foot apartment across the hall, at 1008, is not part of this deal.\nWhile Kogan was once close to Putin, they are now at odds \u2014 fighting over ownership of Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo airport. Russian prosecutorsfiled a caseagainst Kogan and Dmitry Kamenshchik, claiming they failed to renationalize the holding company that manages the facility, according to Russian news reports. In Russia, it\u2019s illegal for foreign entities to control assets that are strategic to national security.\nThe sale comes shortly after the embattled billionaire couple sold their apartment at 15 Central Park West for $33.89 million,as Gimme reported exclusively.\nThe sprawling Plaza condo comes with its own castle-like turret, and features four bedrooms and\u00a04\u00bd baths.\nThe 21-story Plaza Hotel was built in 1907 in French Renaissance style, inspired by a ch\u00e2teau and designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh. The Kogans bought the two units for around $26 million and then combined them.\nThe over-the-top design details include 24-karat gold trim, pricey stone, Venetian plaster, vaulted ceilings, oversize windows, walls sconces and custom cabinetry.\nThe dwelling opens\u00a0to a foyer that leads to a great room with high ceilings, paneled walls, crystal chandeliers and inlay floors.\nThere\u2019s also a chef\u2019s kitchen and a formal dining room with columns overlooking Central Park, while a corridor boasts a built-in bar.\nThe main bedroom suite comes with a spa-like bath in floor-to-ceiling onyx.\nThe Kogans, currently in a massive global property sell-off, also sold a penthouse in Israel for $33 million and a condo at 515 Park Ave. for $14.5 million, which had first listed for $25 million.\u00a0In addition, they have another home in Israel that first listed for $259 million and is now asking a dramatically less $89 million, according to reports. Finally, the Kogans sold their 7-acre Greenwich, Conn., estate for $10.4 million. That home, at 18 Simmons Lane, once asked $20 million and also features turrets,as Gimme Shelter previously reported.\nThe listing broker of the Plaza Hotel apartment, Charlie Attias of Compass, declined to comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "If you\u2019ve got $20 million to spend and a one-story indoor slide is on your list of must-haves, an estate has popped on the market in Weston that could meet your needs.The home, at 67 Byron Road, is listed for $19,850,000, and is billed as \u201ctimeless elegance meets modern luxury,\u201d but with a hint of Chuck-E-Cheese thrown in. In addition to the two-story tube slide, there is a Winnie the Pooh-themed bedroom, a sci-fi vibe game room, a Scrabble-themed bathroom, and a wine cellar that looks like the setting for where the spies exchange microfilm in a thriller.By comparison, the home movie theater and indoor basketball court are relatively subdued, in that they look like a traditional movie theater and basketball court. (Alas, it\u2019s only half-court, but the tube-slide takes you there from the game room above.)AdvertisementThe master staircase features contemporary art.MGS Group Real EstateThe home, which was built in 2002, clocks in with seven bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a 4-car garage, and a whopping 18,725-square-feet of living space. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the interior is a grand staircase adorned colorful geometric shapes. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of contemporary art, but that can be removed,\u201d said Maggie Gold Seelig, the realtor who is handling the sale. \u201cThat does come with the home but that can either be removed by the next owner and either sold or donated.\u201dThe indoor slide connects the game room to the indoor basketball court.MGS Group Real EstateWhen the property last hit the market, for $17 million back in 2013, Curbed called it a \u201ckooky, cringe-worthy mansion.\u201d The home was then owned by Jeffrey Vinik, a minority owner of the Boston Red Sox who was reportedly moving to be closer to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Florida NHL franchise he\u2019d bought three years prior.Now that it\u2019s back on the market, Boston Magazine has compared it to the king of bizarro Massachusetts homes, the full-blown amusement park mansion built by the founder of the Yankee Candle Company.The indoor basketball court.MGS Group Real EstateBut while the interior is filled with idiosyncratic choices, the exterior is more adult and refined, a blend of modern and traditional with arcing roof lines and an outdoor entertaining area worthy of a resort.An expansive granite patio leads to two swimming pools, a pool house, and an apple orchard. Plenty of room for the adults to relax and entertain while the kids run around the Willy Wonka mansion inside.AdvertisementThe outdoor pool area.MGS Group Real Estate\u201cThe house is filled with a lot of whimsy,\u201d Seelig said. \u201cIt\u2019s warm, it\u2019s inviting, it can seat a lot of people for entertaining, or for cozy nights in.\u201dBilly Baker can be reached at billy.baker@globe.com.

From suburban Dyker Heights to pricey Park Slope, all of these neighborhoods shared increases in inventory and declines in median asking prices.\nThat translates to more options at lower costs for buyers, offering much-needed relief amid volatile mortgage rates and eye-popping asking prices.\n\u201cWe were surprised by seeing Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope on our list,\u201d Kenny Lee, an economist at StreetEasy, told The Post. \u201cWe are aware that the market has been competitive in these neighborhoods, but the data suggests that there is some relief on the way for buyers as more sellers join the market.\u201d\nBoerum Hill topped StreetEasy\u2019s list, which analyzed data from January and February. Boerum Hill clocked in a 26% decrease in year-over-year asking prices and a whopping 75% increase in inventory during the same span.\nBuyers beware, however, as the tiny brownstone-lined neighborhood\u2019s inventory only increased by 77 units. The competitive neighborhood saw price cuts in just 9% of listings, which ask in the range of $1.9million.\nThe inventory uptick is almost entirely thanks to new developments in the area, Deborah Rieders, a Brooklyn-based broker at Corcoran, told The Post.\n\u201cI think it is a great time to buy in Boerum Hill,\u201d Rieders said. \u201cBecause once this new development inventory gets absorbed, negotiability is going to disappear again.\u201d\nLong Island City, in Queens, and Brooklyn Heights came in next on the list, both boasting reductions in year-over-year asking prices. Brand new developments in LIC, ranging from rent-stabilized apartments to high-end condos, contributed to an 18% uptick in the neighborhood\u2019s inventory.\nBrooklyn Heights had far more modest inventory gains, but sky-high listing prices in thehistoric waterfront community dropped 23% compared to last year.\nUltra-exclusive Gramercy Park in Manhattan claimed the largest pool of recent price cuts, at 23% of listings. Coastal Brighton Beach, in Brooklyn, ranked second with cuts to almost 20% of listings.\nTypical price cuts, Lee said, tend to average between 3% to 5% in the city.\n\u201cBy slightly lowering prices, sellers are really trying to meet halfway,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey are aware that the financing situation is very tricky with mortgage rates still well above 6%.\u201d\nThis early-year data should be taken on balance \u2014 Brooklyn is still considered the most competitive market in the city. The same StreetEasy data also revealed that arecord-setting 34 neighborhoods in Brooklynhad median asking prices topping $1 million this year.\nInventory jumps of 51% in Dyker Heights helped put that neighborhood on the list as well, despite no changes to the area\u2019s median asking price of $1.44million since early last year. Bensonhurst landed No. 6 on the list.\nPerhaps the most surprising inclusion on StreetEasy\u2019s list was Park Slope, coming it at No.10 on roundup. A slight year-over-year rise in inventory and 21%decrease in asking prices in the affluent neighborhood, known for its opulent brownstones and proximity to Prospect Park, appeared to cool things down early in the year.\nSales activity softened towards the end of February amid stock market turbulence, Rieders said, but she expects things to heat up again once spring is in full swing.\n\u201cIf the prices have softened a little bit because of the larger inventory and new development, it\u2019s a good time to buy,\u201d Rieders said.\nAdvertisement",

Department of Buildings and Safety, but local leaders and residents were quick to criticize the slow pace of the permitting process, with one city councilmember saying it was \u201cconcerning\u201d that only four permits had been issued as of March 24, more than two months after the fires.\nThe first permit was issued by the city on March 5, clearing the way for homeowners to fix up their wrecked properties in the star-studded Pacific Palisades neighborhood, where some 6,800homes either burned to the groundor were seriously damaged\u00a0by the Palisades fire.\nThe owner of the split-level home near Rustic Canyon submitted blueprints to city inspectors back on Feb. 17, reported theLos Angeles Times.\n\u201cWe want this to be happening on your lot, too,\u201d Mayor Bass said at a news conference on Friday.\nAmong the first three permits approved by the city, two were for complete rebuilds: one in the Palisades section and another overlooking the Pacific Coast Highway.\nGary Lionelli, an Emmy-winning film and TV composer who owns the Palisades property destroyed by the wildfire less than a year after he and had family had moved into their newly constructed home, told the Times that he plans to have it rebuilt exactly as it was, in a bid to avoid delays.\nThe mayor has issuedexecutive ordersaimed at streamlining and expediting the rebuilding process in the fire-ravaged communities.\nAmong other measures, the city established a debris-removal task force to clear the way for rebuilding, opened a permitting center, and waived local discretionary review processes\u2014all in the name of speeding up the recovery efforts.\nAs of last week, 72 owners had submitted rebuilding applications to the city, and another 135 to theL.A. County Department of Public Worksfor rebuilding in unincorporated areas impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nAgain, the cleared plot of land has to be graded, or smoothed and shaped, to create a surface suitable for construction.\nBass said on Friday that so far, some 1,000 property owners have not opted in or out of the government-run debris-removal initiative.\nFailing to have all the debris removed could result in a lien being attached to a property.\nDuring an L.A. City Council meeting on Monday, politicians and residents alike voiced their concerns about thepace of the rebuilding process.\n\u201cWe want to get going,\u201d one Palisades resident said at the meeting.\nCouncilmember\u00a0Traci Park, who represents the Palisades section, said she found the low number of permits that so far had been approved by the Department of Buildings and Safety to be unacceptable.\n\u201cWhen I hear in the community meeting like we had today that only four permits have been issued, and we\u2019re on day 75 post-fire, that is concerning to me,\u201d Park said, according toABC7.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of interest in rebuilding, I suspect it is indicative of systemic issues that we need to continue to focus on.\u201d\nRealtor.com\u00aehas reached out to the Department of Buildings, seeking comment on the permitting pace and was awaiting a reply.\nOther City Council members took aim at the mayor\u2019s decision to hire Hagerty Consulting, a private firm, to oversee the recovery effort to the tune of $10 million, even as Los Angeles is staring at a $1 billion budget deficit next year.\nCouncilmember\u00a0Monica Rodriguez\u00a0slammed the move as \u201cobscene.\u201d\n\u201cWe have city departments who know how to do this recovery, who have been involved in recovery efforts in the past,\u201d Rodriguez told ABC7. \u201cAnd yet they can\u2019t be afforded the opportunity to hire the personnel that they need, but we can give a $10 million contract to an outside agency to help write a report for us.\u201d\nBefore any construction could begin, homeowners must have all debris cleared from their lots. For Palisades residents, debris removal is free through a federal program; but homeowners must opt in by completing a Right of Entry form, allowing theU.S. Army Corps of Engineersto access their properties.\nThe process is split into two phases: Phase 1 typically involves identifying and carting away visible household hazardous waste like asbestos, lead, other toxic materials. Phase 2 focuses on clearing ash and the top 3 to 6 inches of contaminated soil.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Home is where the art is.\nThe Manhattan townhouse formerly owned by pop art titan Andy Warhol will list on Thursday for $6.95 million, marking its first sale in more than a decade, The Post has learned.\u00a0And it still retains quirky traces of Warhol\u2019s residency.\nThis Upper East Side dwelling, at 1342 Lexington Ave., last changed hands in 2013 for $5.5 million and brieflyappeared as a rentalin December for $22,550 a month.\nThe current owners, who have held the property as an investment, never called it their own home.\nInstead, they leased it out over the years, said Loy Carlos, the broker representing the sale through Nest Seekers International\u2019s Global Wealth Office.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just ready to move on,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cThey really liked the provenance of the house. I think they were very excited when they bought it \u2026 at this point they just sort of want to divest some properties.\u201d\nWarhol\u2019s imprint on the 19th-century townhouse, designed by architectural luminary Henry J. Hardenbergh \u2014 whose portfolio includes the Plaza Hotel and the Dakota \u2014 is unmistakable.\nFrom 1960 to 1972, this narrow, 3,072-square-foot abode served as both residence and studio, where the artist produced some of his most iconic works \u2014 including the \u201cCampbell\u2019s Soup Cans\u201d and portraits of cultural giants like Muhammad Ali and Marilyn Monroe.\n\u201cHe lived there at a time when he was most productive and a lot of his works that we know, and are well known around the world, were actually done in this house,\u201d Carlos said.\nTraces of Warhol\u2019s era linger in whimsical details: a front door handle fashioned partly from one of his walking sticks, plus a kitchen floor streaked with green paint, a remnant of the garden-level space he used as a studio.\n\u201cThis is where he got his creative juices flowing and made art that funded the lifestyle he had for the rest of his life,\u201d Merav Shalhon of Essential New York Real Estate, previously told The Post. Shalhon noted Warhol shared the home with his mother, who famously picked up those legendary soup cans from a grocery store \u2014 now a Gristedes \u2014 across the street. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a grocery store in one form or another,\u201d she added.\nBuilt in the 1880s, the four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom prewar home reflects a bygone era\u2019s charm.\nCarlos sees it as a fitting parallel to Warhol\u2019s aesthetic.\n\u201cI was thinking about Andy Warhol and how his work was what it was. It wasn\u2019t, you know, pretending to be something else. It was taking something that\u2019s relatively simple. And what seems ordinary and somehow coaxing the glamor out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is that kind of house. It has all of the beautiful elements architecturally. The spaces are correct. The layout is correct. You have a nice feel of the home.\u201d\nThe townhouse\u2019s recent renovation blends modern comforts with its historic bones. A parlor-level foyer opens to a wood-paneled library and a living room with a woodburning fireplace, while upstairs bedrooms \u2014 two with fireplaces \u2014 offer ensuite baths and custom closets.\nThe listing highlights a \u201cbright windowed breakfast kitchen\u201d with top-tier appliances and a den overlooking a rear patio.\nZoned for live/work use, the property could transform into an art gallery or office, with dual entrances enhancing its versatility.\nFor Carlos, the home\u2019s value transcends its walls, enriching Carnegie Hill\u2019s tapestry of architectural treasures.\n\u201cWith these homes on Lex, Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue, etcetera, we\u2019re looking at all of the big houses, and we look at them like gigantic gems that are beautiful and coveted and for very good reason,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I think what we forget in the context of jewelry. When you have a beautiful gem, if you put all of these other smaller jewelry \u2026 smaller diamonds around it, it sparkles. It makes it look better.\u201d\nAndy Warhol left the home in 1972, 15 years before his death at age 58 following complications from a gallbladder surgery. It had been his for 15 years. In 1974, after sitting vacant for two years, Warhol rented it to his longtime business manager and friend Frederick Hughes, who was also ultimately the executor of Warhol\u2019s estate.\nA year after Warhol died, Hughes bought the property from the estate for $593,500 and stayed there until his own death in 2001. Upon Hughes\u2019 death, his sister sold the residence.\nToday, a private family trust owns the residence, and about 150 cats \u2014 descendants of Warhol\u2019s feline companions \u2014 still roam the backyard, Shalhon said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem so far removed from the history and the past than the newer larger buildings devoid of architecture and history,\u201d Carlos said.\n\u201cIt feels rather very gracious and charming. And it almost feels to me like if you close your eyes, you could almost visualize Carnegie Hill where there was a time when kids still played outside.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Housing or train parking?The answer to that question could determine the fate of Boston\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure proposal since the Big Dig redrew the city map around the turn of the century. We\u2019re talking about the $2 billion realignment of the Mass. Turnpike in Allston alongside a new transit hub called West Station. This decade-long construction project, like the Big Dig, isn\u2019t just about transportation. It would open up roughly 100 acres for development \u2014 a whole new neighborhood, sandwiched between Harvard and Boston University.The possibilities for the city are huge. As former BU planning consultant Kishore Varanasi, at architectural firm CBT, puts it: Boston hasn\u2019t seen something of this scale go up on the Charles River since the Back Bay was created, back in the Civil War era.AdvertisementBut the fate of this enormous project could hinge on something relatively small: What will happen along a narrow stretch of land around where the new station would go, south of the realigned turnpike?Harvard owns the strip in question, as part of its Beacon Park Yard holdings, and would much prefer to develop it. The university recently started circulating designs for housing construction, likely a mix of affordable and market-rate units, in this spot. Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration supports this vision, along with many Allston residents; the mix of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings would go up between the station and a linear path that would run parallel with the train tracks, extending out to the river.However, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation has a different use in mind for some of this land around the new station: tracks for train parking and maintenance, as well as bypass tracks to whisk express trains through without stopping, avoiding the new station entirely. The state agency\u2019s newest Allston plan calls for two layover tracks, enough room to park four trains.Related: State officials want to save space for train parking in Allston despite neighborhood concernsThe clash over these competing visions spilled out into public view on March 12 at a neighborhood task force meeting. MassDOT megaprojects boss Luisa Paiewonsky came armed with a report outlining the state\u2019s future rail layover needs. The MBTA acquired 24 acres in the Widett Circle industrial area, south of downtown, two years ago for train layover. But with the Healey administration and Amtrak collaborating to improve east-west train service across the state, they argue Widett won\u2019t be enough. They need even more space.AdvertisementAnd their eyes are fixed squarely on this stretch of dirt in Allston.Although the layover debate dominated the meeting, it has loomed large for a while now. Initial plans for what\u2019s been dubbed the Allston Multimodal Project once called for many more tracks.Then the MBTA secured Widett, and Wu showed an openness to parking and maintaining trains there, particularly as an alternative to Allston.A year ago, state transportation secretary Monica Tibbitts-Nutt essentially promised there would be no layover in Allston. It was a pledge that did not last long.State officials subsequently let it be known that layover in Allston was still on the table. And in November, Tibbitts-Nutt made the official decree: There would be four layover tracks south of West Station. Paiewonsky then became the point person for this project, and an outside facilitator was hired to help improve discussions with the community.To broker a compromise, MassDOT\u2019s Paiewonsky pared back the layover requirement to two tracks instead of four in the weeks leading up to the task force meeting, and relocated them in one conceptual drawing to just north of the new station. The general reaction from Harvard, City Hall, and the neighborhood: Not good enough.They want a more in-depth analysis of a \u201cno layover\u201d alternative, as part of a tallying of the pros and cons. This acreage is valuable, and the general feeling is it could be put to better use. There\u2019s also frustration about the speculative nature of these layover demands, with no guarantee most of these projected trains ever get added to the system. The city obviously needs more housing, and that architecture could make the path to the Charles more appealing than a facade for the walled-in train infrastructure.AdvertisementPlus, there\u2019s widespread concern that by sending many Framingham/Worcester line trains in and out of Boston on that express route without going through West Station, the new transit hub won\u2019t ever reach its full potential.So why not build what the neighborhood wants? From the Healey administration\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. If east-west service gets expanded as intended, the state will need to park these trains somewhere, ideally near the end of the line. Plus, layover is already listed as part of the project\u2019s \u201cpurpose and need\u201d in its permitting documents. And the bypass tracks are simply aimed at ensuring the new station doesn\u2019t slow down trips for commuters coming from points to the west.All this back-and-forth may need to end soon. To hold onto $335 million in federal assistance, MassDOT needs to secure critical federal environmental approvals by September 2026. More than enough time, right? Not exactly. Paiewonsky indicated in the task force meeting that the project team is on a tight timetable. As a result, MassDOT will start filing draft documents with the Federal Highway Administration as soon as next month.Related: US contributes $335 million for realignment of Mass. Pike in Allston, critical financing for \u2018transformational project\u2019Paiewonsky knows she landed on a high wire, amid a tricky balancing act. She sees how Allston fits into a broader transportation vision for the state. But she also knows the leverage that\u2019s held by Harvard, Wu, and the neighborhood (whose state rep, Mike Moran, is among the highest-ranking lawmakers in the State House). Reaching some kind of a consensus will be important.AdvertisementTony D\u2019Isidoro, lifelong resident and head of the Allston Civic Association, made a passionate plea as the task force meeting wrapped up. Harvard, he said, makes a strong case for its vision. He added that the high cost of housing is tearing away the fabric of Allston\u2019s community, much like the turnpike extension did when it was built in the 1960s. He urged Paiewonsky and other state officials to be compassionate and do what\u2019s best for the people who live there. Her response: We would be glad to have that conversation.As a transportation pro, Paiewonsky knows as much as anyone about how to build a massive highway project. While those are rarely easy, it can be even tougher to build a great neighborhood.Jon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

        "content": "The Bar House is raising the bar in East Hampton\u2019s real estate market.\nThe eye-catching 9,000-square-foot modernist home, named for the two elongated bar-like structures stacked in perpendicular fashion to form the L-shaped structure, recently closed for $17.77 million, according to the real estate firm that found the buyer.\nThe sale sets a record for the town\u2019s Northwest Woods section, located between Sag Harbor and Springs, said Brown Harris Stevens agent David Tenenbaum, who brought the buyer.\nThe new Bar House owner, who works in tech, will become neighbors with the likes of actor Neil Patrick Harris and fashion designer Donna Karan, said Tenenbaum.\n\u201cThis property really spoke to him,\u201d Tenenbaum said of his client. \u201cIt\u2019s got so much privacy. It\u2019s sited on almost 13 acres, and it\u2019s surrounded by 500 acres of East Hampton town preserve.\u201d\nFloor-to-ceiling windows wrap the glass-and-steel house. One section offers treetop views of the landscape and provides cover for an outdoor living space below with oversized moon-like recessed lights.\nThe terrace contains a fireplace and an open kitchen with a pizza oven, a sink, a refrigerator, an ice maker, a built-in grill and a dining area. Around the corner is a curvilinear structure holding up that end of the \u201cbar\u201d with an S-curve entrance that, like an airport, leads to an interior bathroom. Outside, there are two outdoor showers.\nThe area overlooks a 60-foot pool.\nThe other section of the five-bedroom, five-bathroom, two half-bathroom dwelling is one story on ground level. There, a large living area contains 12-foot ceilings, radiant-heated bluestone floors and a double-sided fireplace \u2014 as well as a kitchen with marble countertops and high-end BlueStar appliances. There are also two bedrooms with their own bathrooms \u2014 plus laundry, powder and mud rooms.\nThe most unusual part of the home\u2019s interior may be the second-story-wing master bathroom, an open space where the floor, made from marble imported from Turkey, performs an unusual task.\n\u201cThe ceiling has two large shower heads that are embedded \u2026 they don\u2019t project down at all,\u201d said Manhattan architect Audrey Matlock, who designed the Bar House and worked with Hamptons-based Lettieri Construction to build the 2016 home. \u201cThere are no shower walls.\u201d\nInstead of grout between the tiles, water drains into a pan underneath the floor of the room, which measures about 15 by 20 feet, she said. \u201cYou just stand in the room and take a shower,\u201d as the bather peers out upon nature, said Matlock.\nThe Bar House incorporates the outdoors with the house, said Tenenbaum. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s modern, from every angle, from every room, you can see all of this nature,\u201d he said.\nAnnual property taxes are $35,042.\nIn the runup to the deal, Tenenbaum said he brought in the buyer to watch the sun go down.\n\u201cHe stayed for two hours because we watched the sunset on the property,\u201d Tenenbaum said. \u201cIt was just kind of breathtaking.\u201d\nIntermittent between the windows are zinc panels that on the outside function as design elements in the exterior while providing privacy \u2014 and on the inside deliver built-in gallery space for displaying large-scale art, Matlock said. \u201cThe idea was that a dozen large paintings are floating between glimpses of the forest,\u201d she said.\nThe property also comes with a sunken tennis court, geothermal heating and cooling, an attached studio and a two-car garage, according to the listing. It is protected by a chain-link fence painted black where native plants grow into the structure so that it disappears, said Matlock.\nThe design, she said, took about 1\u00bd to two years, and the construction about four.\nNorthwest Woods is the area north of East Hampton Village on the west side of Three-Mile Harbor, said Tenenbaum.\nThe sellers, who are New Yorkers, sold because they are moving out west for work, said Matlock. She said she is \u201ccrushed\u201d that the home was sold because it \u201cwas made for them, and they were so happy there.\u201d\n\u201cWe, as architects, also get close to the things that we make, you know, and sometimes it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh no, no, it\u2019s now going to someone else,\u2019\u201d she said.\nSusan Ryan of Compass listed the house in June for $18.5 million.\n\u201cThis is the first inland property in most of the Hamptons that I can think of that is selling at this price point,\u201d she said.\nTenenbaum agreed, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing up in the Northwest Woods that sold at this number.\u201d\nRyan described the Bar House as a one-of-a-kind dwelling with unparalleled privacy that will likely drive prices higher in East Hampton\u2019s woodsy section of town, which is known for its large lots of land.\n\u201cWhenever you have something that\u2019s unique that transfers at a high price point, I think people pay attention, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I think people will look to this area a bit more.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The housing market in California is flashing a key warning signal that could lead to a slowdown in home price growth or evenfalling prices in some markets.\nThe supply of homes listed for sale in\u00a0California\u00a0is surging, rising 44% in February compared with a year ago, according to data from the\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0economic research team. The national increase was just 28%.\nThe California surge is the fourth-largest annual increase in active listings among the states, behind only\u00a0Nevada,\u00a0Hawaii, and\u00a0Colorado. In some California cities, the effect is even more pronounced.\nNick Gerli, founder and CEO of real estate data startupReventure App, noted ina recent post on Xthat 5 of the top 11 U.S. cities for annual inventory growth are in California, including\u00a0San Diego, where active listings are up 61% from a year ago.\nRising inventory is usually an early warning sign of weaker price growth, as supply begins to outpace demand, leaving buyers with more options and forcing some sellers to make concessions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very realistic to expect that, based on the more than 50% year-over-year inventory increase in some of these California markets, we\u2019re going to see a big slowing in home price growth over the next 12 months,\u201d Gerli tells Realtor.com.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if prices trend flat across the state or even slightly negative by the end of the year, and particularly in certain markets,\u201d he adds.\nSome California markets might have also hit an \u201caffordability wall\u201don home prices, notes Gerli. In San Diego, for example, the median February list price of more than $948,000 is far out of reach for a family making the local median household income of about $104,000.\nStill, Gerli says the rising\u00a0inventory\u00a0warning comes with an important caveat, which is that California\u2019s housing supply is expanding from a state of severe shortage, and today just 0.6% of the state\u2019s homes are on the market.\nStatewide, housing inventory remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Gerli doesn\u2019t anticipate a dramatic price correction in California, but rather a more gradual market reset, supported bylow unemploymentand\u00a0mortgage\u00a0default rates in the state.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still nowhere near what we\u2019ve seen in Florida in terms of supply,\u201d he says. \u201cI almost view what we\u2019re seeing in California today as maybe what we started seeing in Florida a year ago.\u201d\nHannah Jones, a senior economic research analyst with Realtor.com, says that although many California metros have seen climbing active listings annually, inventory levels remain below pre-pandemic levels in most of them.\n\u201cThese markets are moving back toward balance, which can be seen in slowing price growth and moderating time on market,\u201d she says. \u201cSome markets have seen listing prices fall annually in recent months, but some of the decline is because of a shift in the mix of inventory available.\u201d\nIn other words, a rising share of smaller homes listed for sale has dragged typical prices down, a trend that has also been observed nationwide.\nHowever, three California cities did see annual declines in median list prices per square foot in February: San Diego,\u00a0Sacramento, and\u00a0San Francisco.\nSan Francisco saw the sharpest decline of 7.3%, followed by San Diego falling 2% and Sacramento losing 1.3%.\nOnly time will tell if the lower square-foot list prices in those cities will translate into lower sales prices and falling home values.\n\u201cAs inventory builds, it is likely that price growth will continue to ease and time on market will slow,\u201d says Jones. \u201cHowever, California metros tend to be rather competitive and undersupplied, so it is unlikely that prices will adjust lower too significantly in the short term.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The Town of Middleborough Friday dropped its lawsuit against the state over the controversial MBTA Communities law after agreeing to expand an existing zoning district allowing multifamily housing to meet the law\u2019s requirements.The deal between Middleborough and the state came after the town last month sued the state housing office for an exemption from MBTA Communities, the 2021 law that mandates cities and towns served by the T make it easier to build multifamily housing. The Plymouth County town had argued it already had a zoning district, created under the state\u2019s smart growth zoning program 40R, that allows for multifamily homes, and should not be obligated to create another one.Town Manager Jay McGrail said both sides should be satisfied with the agreement. Middleborough will meet the requirements of MBTA Communities, a priority of Governor Maura Healey\u2019s administration in its push to ease the housing crisis, and Middleborough gets to meet those requirements by simply expanding its 40R district, as opposed to crafting a new one.\u201cLocal control was our top priority in this,\u201d said McGrail. \u201cSo we feel very satisfied with the outcome here. We\u2019re expanding a district that we already had, that we spent years crafting. We\u2019re keeping our control over our zoning.\u201dRelated: Middleborough sues Healey, state over MBTA housing law requirementsAdvertisementThe state housing office said in a statement Friday that it had approved the town\u2019s plan to comply and would review the zoning once officials submit it.Middleborough town officials created the existing 40R district in 2021 near the commuter rail station downtown. Its zoning allows multifamily housing by-right, or without special permission from a board, up to four stories tall. To date, 174 multifamily units have been permitted there, a quarter of them set at affordable rents.MBTA Communities requires Middleborough to have zoning in place with a capacity for at least 1,471 units, meaning that if all of the buildings within the borders of the district were razed, developers could build 1,471 units by-right. As it stands, the district only allows for 549 units.Its expansion into the East Clark part of town will create the additional capacity to meet the state\u2019s requirements, and the same parameters for development will apply there as well. Middleborough Town Meeting must approve the expansion of the district.AdvertisementMcGrail said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll played a significant role in brokering the agreement.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysMiddleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law\u2019s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.The town sued the state last month after State Auditor Diana DiZoglio issued an opinion calling MBTA Communities an \u201cunfunded mandate,\u201d opening the door for towns to pursue exemptions from the law in court. Several other towns have since filed lawsuits as well.It\u2019s the latest point of tension between cities and towns and the state over the law, which lawmakers passed in early 2021. Ever since, some communities have pushed back, saying it is taking away their local control over zoning. For its part, the Healey Administration has pushed hard to enforce the law, seeing it as key to opening up the suburbs and towns around Greater Boston that have historically blocked growth to more housing development.\u201cWe were clear from the beginning that we\u2019re not against more housing. That is a priority of the town,\u201d said McGrail. \u201cNow, we feel like we\u2019re doing it the right way.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "By Andrew Brinker, The Boston Globe\n\nIt is a freezing winter evening, and Thomas Macdonald cannot find apartment 41A.\n\nHe figured it would be on thefifth floor of this 19th century building in Boston\u2019s Symphony neighborhood, but there, the highest number was 39. Now a bead of sweat dribbles down the side of his forehead as he leads a trio of Northeastern University students in sweatpants back down four flights of creaking stairs and into a narrow basement.\n\nRoughly 10 minutes of searching and two calls to the building owner later, he finally discovers apartment 41A, at the bottom of an outdoor staircase that is hidden by a stand of bushes.\n\nNow, he can go to work.\n\nThe current occupants of unit 41A sit awkwardly in their bedrooms as Macdonald leads the students around the basement apartment. The place smells vaguely of cat urine, and there is a network of pipes running across the ceiling that may, or may not, transport the building\u2019s sewage. Macdonald explains that if they want a three-bedroom for around $4,500, this is the most spacious option they\u2019ll find.\n\n\u201cYou have to be straightforward with people about what\u2019s realistic for them,\u201d Macdonald says after the tour as he walks back to his Honda Civic, parked hastily behind a food truck. \u201cThey already hate us.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cus,\u201d Macdonald means Boston\u2019s army of rental brokers, and \u201chate\u201d may in fact be an accurate descriptor of how many renters feel about them.\n\nThe word \u201cbroker\u201d is a charged term in Boston these days, invokinga sense of dread \u2014 a knot in the stomach \u2014 among renters who associate them with jingling rings of apartment keys, ill-planned tours, andthe often-massive sum they demand, known as a broker\u2019s fee, before you can sign a lease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat fee is typically equal to a month of rent, and combined with a security deposit and other required payments, can contribute to a five-figure upfront move-in cost in a rental market that is already jaw-droppingly expensive and stacked against renters.\n\nBut beyond the dollars,much of the antipathy toward brokersstems from the fact that many renters do not see what, if anything, brokers do on their behalf.\n\nWith the ubiquity of online listings, renters can easily search for apartments themselves, yet in many cases, they still have to pay a broker to sign a lease. And afterNew York City outlawed tenant-paid broker fees last year, Boston and neighboring cities like Cambridge and Somerville constitute the only major urban center in the United States where renters are obligated to pay.\n\nThat could soon change. Momentum is building for a law in Bostonthat would charge the fees to whoever hires the broker between the landlord and the renter, rather than allowing landlords to decide. Key legislators have signaled their support,and Governor Maura Healey has signed on.\n\nSome brokers have takenthat recent push as an affront on their profession, and warn that the housing market cannot function without them. Their job, they say, is to find renters a good deal.\n\nRenters aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expected to pay this guy?\u201d one of the students remarked under his breath as Macdonald wandered through the Symphony building searching for apartment 41A.\n\nMacdonald has only been a broker for a few years, but he knows the business. He wears a navy suit bulky enough for a professional wrestler and oozes with the confidence of a 22-year-old, which he is. He crushes energy drinks instead of coffee, and the empty cans litter his car\u2019s floorboards. He fires off text messages at red lights, because, he says, \u201ctime is money.\u201d He hopes to parlay the money he makes leasing rentals into investment properties someday.\n\nMacdonald is the youngest broker at Jacob Realty on Newbury Street, one of a handful of brokerages run by Boston real estate mogul Demetrios Salpoglou. He lives with his parents in New Hampshire and starts his day around 7:30 a.m., after an hour\u2019s drive to work.\n\nOn a recent day, Macdonald settles into his desk near a drafty window overlooking Newbury Street. The room fills with chatter of brokers calling landlords and loudly drafting voice-to-text messages to prospective tenants. In a back room, there is a wall with thousands of keys to apartments Jacob helps rent.\n\n\nMacdonald usually starts his days scanning Salpoglou\u2019s database of 215,000 rental units for apartments that are about to hit the market or that have lingered for awhile.\n\nThis morning, he has spotted a couple of one-bedrooms in Allston that are about to hit the market, both renting for over $2,000 a month.\n\n\u201cCan you make the moving costs any easier?\u201d he asks the landlord on the phone, angling for a sweetener he can offer would-be tenants, like a break on the security deposit.\n\nThe landlord says no.\n\n***\n\nReal estate brokers have been around in Boston for as long as people have needed homes.Brokers say they serve an important purpose: helping people navigate the cutthroat housing market to find a home where they can build their lives. But they tend to work mostly on behalf of landlords in this housing market, where homes are in high demand. Those owners typically have enough leverage to push the broker fee off to their tenants.\n\nSites like Zillow and Apartment List allow apartment-hunters to narrow down options, but in many cases, they can\u2019t tour a unit without interacting with a broker who has listed the place on a landlord\u2019s behalf.\n\nIt can be a lucrative venture. Macdonald would not say how much he makes in a year, but its an eat-what-you-kill business. Most rental brokers\u2019 compensation consists entirely of fees they charge on apartment rentals, and it can vary widely from broker to broker. A successful broker can easily make six figures by leasing expensive apartments at an efficient clip. Others who lease just a few units a month make considerably less. There are thousands of brokers in Boston battling for the listings and leases of the city\u2019s more than 300,000 apartments. On Newbury Street alone, there are several dozen brokerages.\n\n\u201cBrokers and leasing agents provide a valuable service, and we get compensated for those services,\u201d said Eric Shabshelowitz, vice president of the luxury real estate agency Cabot & Company. \u201cYears ago, it was landlords who paid the fee, but the market has changed.\u201d\n\nSome brokers focus on hawking cheaper rentals to Boston\u2019s flood of college students. Others work in specific neighborhoods.\n\nRob Oteri, who founded the rental site JPRentals, focuses mainly on apartments in Jamaica Plain, where he lives. He said he tries to maintain personal relationships with landlords and works diligently with prospective renters to help them find the best place for them in their price range.\n\nWhen brokers do their job well, Oteri said, the fee shouldn\u2019t be quite so painful. But theirs is a volume business, and some brokers simply try to lease as many units as possible as quickly as possible. That leads to instances, he said, when brokers show up to lead apartment tours without ever having seen the unit.\n\n\u201cI certainly understand the frustration with some brokers who maybe have a \u2018turn and burn\u2019 mentality about the work,\u201d Oteri said. \u201cBut a good broker earns their money by working closely with tenants to get them the best deal.\u201d\n\nMacdonald\u2019s day has taken him into Allston, near Commonwealth Avenue, where he has picked up keys from one of the city\u2019s biggest student landlords, Alpha Management, so he can take photos of Alpha apartments that will soon come on the market.\n\nHis first stop is a clean but tiny one-bedroom with a closet too thin for a person to stand in. It has nice natural light and a full kitchen.\n\n\u201cThis one will go fast,\u201d he says while taking note of the \u201cstandalone closet.\u201d\n\n\nAs he drives toward his next stop, he defends the value of his profession.\n\nFinding apartments without brokers, he says, would be harder, because there would be no one to cultivate and centralize listings and organize tours. And his knowledge of the market helps him find renters the best deals, which is his top priority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the free market,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nThe next unit, a few blocks away, is quite different: An upper-floor studio with a big window and a sprawling view of the city.There\u2019s a new mattress, a large bag of marijuana on top of the fridge, and a fresh eviction notice in the entryway. Macdonald takes a few photos.\n\nThen he shows those Northeastern students the basement apartment and returns to the office, where he begins posting his photos and updating listings on Jacob\u2019s website. He also looks around for more three-bedroom options for the students.\n\nAround 8 p.m., Macdonald gets a text.\n\nThanks for showing us around. My roommates and I will be looking elsewhere.\n\nHe curses and lets out a sigh.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name of the game \u2014 I did all of that work, showed those kids around, and at the end of the day, I didn\u2019t make a dime,\u201d Macdonald says. \u201cGotta work harder tomorrow.\u201d\n\nView Survey\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A massive 110,000-acre New Mexico ranch, bigger than the city of Denver, just galloped onto the market with a staggering $68.5 million price tag, making its grand debut after more than 45 years under one family\u2019s reign.\nLocated near the remote hamlet of Fence Lake, this property \u2014 known as Atarque Ranch \u2014 has been a cherished retreat for the Yates family since 1978, a lineage tied to the oil and gas fortunes of Yates Petroleum Corp., which they sold to EOG Resources for $2.5 billion in 2016.\nThe decision to part with this rugged paradise stems from the passing of John Yates Sr., who, alongside his three brothers, acquired the land decades ago, according toMansion Global.\nHis death three years ago at age 93 has prompted the family to seek a new steward.\n\u201cWe will miss the ranch,\u201d Trey Yates, vice president of the family\u2019s Abo Empire, told the outlet, noting the sale aligns with a strong market.\n\u201cBut the market\u2019s good right now. It\u2019s a business decision.\u201d\nThe family, known for its recreational use of the property, issued a statement expressing its hope: \u201cSeeking a new steward to preserve the ranch\u2019s natural beauty, wildlife and significant Native American heritage.\u201d\nTrey Yates III, now 30 and grandson of the late John Yates Sr., carries fond memories of the land.\nAs a child, he roamed its diverse terrain \u2014 stretching from high plateaus to deep canyons and sweeping grasslands \u2014 uncovering relics of the past.\n\u201cYou never knew what you were going to find,\u201d he said, recalling the thrill of discovering arrowheads and pottery shards amid Native American petroglyphs and the stone remnants of early settlers.\nThe ranch, named for its Spanish translation \u201cearthen dam,\u201d doubles as both a thriving wildlife sanctuary \u2014 home to bull elk, mule deer and pronghorn antelope \u2014 and a functioning livestock operation.\nReal estate broker Jeff Buerger of Hall and Hall, who listed the property on Sunday, highlights its unique appeal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely well blocked out \u2014 it does not have a lot of public access,\u201d he told Mansion Global, emphasizing its status as a premier hunting ground for elk.\nThe ranch\u2019s remote headquarters, accessible via Highway 36 and roughly 160 miles from Albuquerque, features a four-bedroom, two-bathroom main residence, a three-bedroom manager\u2019s home \u2014 and an array of outbuildings including a metal barn, a log barn and equipment sheds.\nWith 26 wells, a spring and 105 stock ponds, the property also holds a rare water rights decree covering nearly 60 acres \u2014 a scarce asset in the region.\nBuerger points to the land\u2019s untouched allure, from its dramatic rock outcrops, arroyos and more.\n\u201cThere are really beautiful things about the land,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no light pollution, so the star scape is exceptional.\u201d\nHe added that finding a comparable property at this price in New Mexico, or even in Montana\u2019s high-end ranch market, would be a challenge.\nThe Yates family\u2019s roots in resource development trace back to 1924, when Martin Yates Jr. and his wife, Mary, struck oil with their Illinois No. 3 well in Eddy County, the first commercial success on state lands.\nTheir four sons \u2014 Harvey, Martin II, St. Clair Peyton (S.P.) and John \u2014 carried the legacy forward, shaping Artesia and the broader region.\nS.P. Yates founded Yates Drilling Co., later sold, while his descendants established Santo Petroleum in 2010. Alongside Abo Empire and Sharbro Energy, the family\u2019s diverse holdings reflect a century of enterprise.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "On a sun-drenched stretch of North Bay Road, where palm trees sway and Biscayne Bay glimmers, a real estate revolution has unfolded since the pandemic turned Miami Beach into a magnet for the ultra-wealthy.\nThis narrow, tree-lined street, long a haven for the rich, has transformed into Miami-Dade County\u2019s priciest enclave \u2014 with roughly 150 waterfront properties now collectively valued at more than $1.7 billion.\nFueled by a wave of newcomers seeking Florida\u2019s tax perks, balmy climate and laid-back luxury, the road has seen a staggering $1.19 billion in sales since 2020, with 24 deals topping $20 million, according to data compiled bythe Wall Street Journal.\nAt the heart of this frenzy is Robert Zarco, a commercial litigator who, more than 20 years ago, snapped up an acre of bay-front land for $3 million. He poured $15 million into crafting a sprawling 19,000-square-foot Mediterranean villa, complete with 11 bedrooms, a vast pool and docks for his quartet of yachts. Since the pandemic hit, brokers have bombarded him with offers, some soaring past $100 million.\n\u201cIf I told you I\u2019ve had 40 offers, that would probably be an underestimate,\u201d he told the Journal. Yet Zarco, now 64, won\u2019t budge.\n\u201cIf you offered me $200 million, I still wouldn\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d never be able to replicate this lifestyle. To build something else now would take years that I might not have.\u201d\nThe numbers tell a story of unprecedented escalation. Land that once fetched $500 per foot now commands $1,000 to $1,500. Nearly 40% of its waterfront homes \u2014 59 properties \u2014 have changed hands since 2020, often shattering records with double-digit price jumps.\n\u201cNorth Bay Road is the Park Avenue of Miami Beach,\u201d Nelson Gonzalez, a veteran agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, told The Journal. The street\u2019s cachet mirrors elite pockets like Malibu\u2019s Paradise Cove or Palm Beach\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Beach, where the superrich cluster in tight-knit enclaves.\nThe roster of residents reads like a who\u2019s who of power and fame.\nApollo co-founder Josh Harris scooped up a 9,400-square-foot, nine-bedroom estate for $32.25 million in July 2021, a steal compared to its $80,000-a-month rental listing under previous owner Marcelo Claure.\nIn 2002, Jennifer Lopez purchased the home at 5800 North Bay Road for $9.5 million. She sold it in 2005 for $13.9 million. It last sold in 2021 by then-owner Phil Collins for $39.25 million to an unknown LLC.\nSupermodel Karlie Kloss and venture capitalist Joshua Kushner quietly acquired a 15,000-square-foot mansion for $21.5 million in August 2020, nearly doubling the seller\u2019s purchase price from a year earlier.\nSoccer icon David Beckham and designer Victoria Beckham made headlines in October 2024, dropping $72.25 million on a 12,500-square-foot retreat with a spa and pool \u2014 the priciest sale in the street\u2019s history.\nShakira has held court here since 2001, when she bought a 8,700-square-foot mid century gem for $3.38 million; she listed it for $15.9 million in 2021.\nBelieve it: The list of names goes on.\nShutterstock founder Jonathan Oringer and his wife, Talia, joined the fray in October 2020, paying $42 million for a 20,000-square-foot spread once owned by Alex Rodriguez.\nEntrepreneur Rande Gerber and model Cindy Crawford opted for a $9.62 million fixer-upper in December 2020, later replacing it with a custom build.\nSteve Witkoff, a real estate developer and Donald Trump\u2019s lead negotiator currently serving as the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, purchased a 0.4-acre vacant lot for $8 million in 2020. He has since listed the land several times over the years. It was taken off the market in January 2025.\nMedia titan Barry Diller entered the scene in April 2024, securing a 1.5-acre lot for $45 million.\n\u201cNice street \u2014 nice bend in the road,\u201d Diller said of his plans for a family compound. Even Bee Gees legend Barry Gibb, a resident since 1981 with his $1.58 million purchase, remains a fixture, his 15,241-square-foot home a nod to the street\u2019s storied past.\nThe pandemic sparked this gold rush.\n\u201cA lot of people who came down during the pandemic, they\u2019re used to living in cities and walking, especially in New York City. They like that this is walkable,\u201d said Jill Hertzberg, a luxury broker with Coldwell Banker Realty.\nLower North Bay, near South Beach and Sunset Harbour\u2019s trendy haunts, has surged in popularity, while Upper North Bay \u2014 home to Zarco\u2019s estate \u2014 retains its aura of seclusion.\nNew or move-in-ready homes fetch top dollar, with buyers willing to pay premiums for instant gratification.\n\u201cThere is so much money coming to Miami Beach. They have more money than time,\u201d Gonzalez told the outlet. \u201cThey\u2019d rather pay an extra $30, $40, $50 million to have the house already built and you hand them the keys.\u201d\nScarcity has only intensified the feeding frenzy. \u201cAt this point, we have to sort of knock on doors just to get people to sell, and not even knock on doors \u2014 knock on their door and bring them an outrageous offer with a contract in hand,\u201d Gonzalez added.\nYet many, like Zarco, cling to their slice of paradise.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s selling,\u201d Hertzberg added. \u201cAt the beginning, people were thinking, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll go back to New York, maybe I\u2019ll go back to Chicago, eventually.\u2019 Now, no one wants to go back. No one wants to leave the paradise they have found.\u201d\nFor some, it\u2019s about more than money. Anand Khubani, founder of IdeaVillage Products, bought a $40 million spec home in January 2025, drawn by \u201cthe quality of the owners.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes you feel more comfortable when there are other successful business people,\u201d Khubani said.\nMichael Bay, the film director who paid $17 million in 2007 for an 18,000-square-foot modernist masterpiece, echoes the sentiment.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about the money. Nope, I want to live here,\u201d he told the Journal, shrugging off offers exceeding $40 million.\nZarco, too, savors the intangibles. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep in my bank account. I can\u2019t throw a party in my bank account,\u201d he says. \u201cSitting out on my dock watching the sunset at the end of the day, there is nothing like it. It\u2019s like the fountain of youth. It ages you in reverse.\u201d\nStill, paradise comes at a cost. Zarco\u2019s insurance has ballooned to over $100,000 annually, a fourfold increase since he moved in. Others plow millions into hurricane-proofing, a necessity in a region prone to extreme storms.\n\u201cIt would take a tremendous storm for the water to reach the house,\u201d Zarco said of his reinforced estate. \u201cThe house is not going anywhere.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The old Barnes & Noble in Downtown Crossing has sat vacant for nearly two decades. It\u2019s a historic building on a corridor of Washington Street that\u2019s both bustling with pedestrians and dotted with vacancy signs. Out front, there\u2019s a payphone that still crackles when picked up and a piece of street art designed to spark renewed vitality into downtown.Now, 399 Washington has new life, in the form of new owners, who bought it at a bargain-basement price.Earlier this month, Boston-based Hudson Group and Assembly Investments of New York closed on their purchase of the retail and office building for $13 million \u2014 80 percent less than its prior sale in 2017. That sort of discount portends a difficult future ahead for Boston\u2019s budget, which is largely reliant on property taxes. But, as new owners Noam Ron and Evan Oscar Papanastasiou expect, it also means they can lower rents to the point where they can actually attract a tenant to a building where the ground floor has been empty since 2006.The old Barnes & Noble in Downtown Crossing has sat vacant for nearly two decades. Here, it's pictured on March 6, 2006.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAdvertisement399 Washington was family-owned for decades, until 2017 when Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management and L3 Capital bought it for $63 million. They then invested millions more into a full suite of upgrades: working bathrooms and elevators, new mechanical and HVAC systems. They stripped off the two-story gray slab that hung over the building\u2019s entrance for years, replacing it with tall expanses of metal and glass windows. The owners started marketing the retail space shortly after buying the building, and completed upgrades in 2021.Related: Empty since 2006, this downtown building is back on the marketBut tenants never came. And earlier this year, with office demand still weak following the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and no rental income coming in \u2014 399 Washington ended up in a real-estate owned sale.The prospect of a freshly overhauled building at a big discount drew interest from several investors \u2014 including Celtics star Jaylen Brown \u2014 but the bid by Hudson and Assembly won. Now they plan to market the property at rents in the $40s per square foot, $7 to $10 less than the typical rent for Class B office space downtown, and around $20 less than what the prior owners would have had to charge, Papanastasiou said. Bringing in a ground-floor retailer, and resetting rents for offices up above, will bring an energy to the property that hasn\u2019t been seen in decades, the new owners said.Advertisement\u201cThat will cast a wide net for tenancy,\u201d Papanastasiou said. \u201cJust lighting up this building is going to help tremendously.\u201dThe ground floor of 399 Washington Street in Downtown Crossing has been vacant since a Barnes & Noble store there closed in 2006.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/Boston GlobeRon and Papanastasiou aren\u2019t alone. Amid a broad post-COVID reset in office values across the city that has long-reluctant owners resigning themselves to selling at a loss, investors and developers are spying opportunity, eager to snap up well-located spaces \u2014 and then offer them to tenants at lower rents.One such opportunistic investor is Broder, a Boston-based real estate investment and development firm that recently bought 15 Broad St. downtown. It\u2019s Broder\u2019s second time owning the building, which it sold to Brookfield Properties in 2016 for $32.5 million. In late 2019, just a few months before COVID hit Boston, Brookfield sold it to TA Realty for $46.1 million. Earlier this year, Broder bought it back, for $13.5 million \u2014 $5 million less than it first paid to buy it 18 years ago.Broder is privately funded with family wealth, and its portfolio has little debt, said managing partner Eric Svenson. (His and brother Ben Svenson\u2019s father, John Svenson, passed from cancer in 2007 and was a prominent Boston real estate developer, philanthropist, and co-owner of the Boston Celtics.) TA\u2019s underwriting was reasonable when it bought the property, Svenson said, but the market shifts since are inescapable.These days, groups that bought buildings prior to the pandemic and with a five- or seven-year mortgage find themselves with little option but to sell for a loss. That means opportunity for firms like his; Svenson said he\u2019d like to make several similar acquisitions this year.Advertisement\u201cA lot of sellers are feeling like it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we had ten times the available capital we have. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for three decades and I\u2019ve never seen opportunities like this.\u201dProperties like 15 Broad St. and 399 Washington St. that have changed hands for significant discounts can give landlords flexibility to offer tenants space for a discount, or invest in modern amenities \u2014 a crucial factor in today\u2019s leasing landscape, said Wil Catlin, a senior partner with Boston Realty Advisors. But these days, Catlin noted, many tenants consider offices more an asset than a requirement, and they prize amenities and places for employees to connect with peers. So while pricing is important, it\u2019s not the only consideration.One of the last remnants of the Barnes & Noble store that once occupied the bottom two floors of 399 Washington Street.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/Boston Globe\u201cThe question is pricing for what?\u201d Catlin said. \u201cFor a lack of a better term, it\u2019s got to feel good. You\u2019ve got to want to be there. If the owner is saying they get a $7 per square foot discount, and the employees and staff are not getting a differential experience, they\u2019re like: \u2018Uh, why are we here again?\u2018\u201dCatlin and other experts expect more deals like this as sales activity increases this year after a long slow period since COVID-19. Some of those sales will come as deep-pocketed global real estate owners pivot away from commercial real estate in an effort to curb future losses.Private equity behemoth Blackstone in 2023 told the Globe it would continue to pare back its office holdings. It paid around $156 million in January 2020 for a five-story brick-and-beam office at 179 Lincoln St. Last March, Blackstone handed both the building \u2014 and its $76.5 million in mortgage debt \u2014 over to Synergy Investments, according to Suffolk County records.AdvertisementMeanwhile Swiss bank UBS Group has been shedding office properties across the United States. In September, a UBS arm sold 400 Atlantic Ave., a six-story brick office facing Boston Harbor, for $30 million to the development arm of French financier Jacques Chahine, Suffolk County records show.That\u2019s 40 percent less than the $50 million UBS paid to buy 400 Atlantic in 2014, and followed the departure of long-term tenant Goulston & Storrs. Chahine Investment Corp. plans to convert the office to a hotel and restaurant, which would newly open to hotel customers a deck facing Boston Harbor that had been private for over 40 years, attorney Jared Eigerman wrote in a January letter of intent to the city\u2019s Planning Department.Over in Downtown Crossing, Papanastasiou and Ron said they\u2019re already in advanced conversations with several retailers to lease 399 Washington\u2019s expansive first and second floor, which are connected by a striking brass staircase \u2014 a remnant of the Barnes & Noble days. They aim to sign an office lease soon for one of the upper floors. A fully built out office suite on the fourth floor, for example, is ready for a tenant any day.\u201cWe\u2019re confident we can lease that to an office tenant this year,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe\u2019re bullish on the future of downtown, and on this building.\u201dThe new owners of 399 Washington Street in Downtown Crossing are hoping to lure a new anchor tenant to its two-story retail space.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/Boston GlobeCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A storied five-bedroom, two-bathroom colonial residence in Queens\u2019 Addisleigh Park historic district, once home to baseball icon Jackie Robinson during his Brooklyn Dodgers glory days, is now up for rent asking $5,000 a month, The Post has learned.\nSpanning nearly 3,000 square feet, the dwelling at 112-40 177th St. in St. Albans offers a rare chance to lease a piece of American sports and civil rights heritage \u2014 as it\u2019s where Robinson lived when he clinched the Dodgers\u2019 first World Series title in 1955.\nThe move to St. Albans from Brooklyn in 1949 marked a new chapter for the Robinson family. With Jackie Jr. nearing his third birthday and his wife, Rachel, expecting their second child, Sharon, the couple outgrew their Flatbush apartment on Tilden Avenue.\nSeeking more space, they traded proximity to Ebbets Field for a larger home in this stretch of Queens, joining a burgeoning enclave in Addisleigh Park.\nThis vibrant community, already a haven for black luminaries, had begun to flourish, despite its origins as a racially restricted suburb.\nSt. Albans\u2019 transformation traces back to its early days as a railroad suburb for white families fleeing urban density in the 1900s. By the 1930s, restrictive covenants \u2014 private agreements embedded in property deeds \u2014 made for racial segregation in terms of home sales, a common practice across the Northeast.\nThough the Supreme Court had struck down state-enforced segregation in 1917, these covenants persisted, often required for FHA-backed mortgages. Change came in 1948 with\u00a0Shelly v. Kraemer, which deemed such restrictions unenforceable, cracking open the door for black families to settle in St. Albans.\n\u201cThere was a restrictive covenant on the deeds where homeowners were not allowed to sell to anyone outside of the white race,\u201d said Nadine Morency-Mohs of Jaymore Realty LLC, the home\u2019s listing agent. \u201cAnd there was a neighbor who was furious at one of his neighbors when he was moving and spitefully sold his home to an African-American.\u201d\nThat act of defiance, as well as the court ruling, sparked a shift.\n\u201cIt was challenged that it is illegal for these deeds to have a restrictive covenant, hence the reason why a lot of sports and entertainment luminaries moved into this neighborhood,\u201d she added.\nBy the 1940s, jazz legends like Count Basie and Fats Waller had laid roots there, turning St. Albans into a cultural hub. The Robinsons arrived in 1949, following Dodgers teammate Roy Campanella, who had settled there a year earlier.\n\u201cSo when Jackie Robinson moved here, he moved with one of his best friends who owned a nightclub in Harlem, from there a lot of the entertainers \u2026 learned about the neighborhood as well, and they also moved into the neighborhood,\u201d Morency-Mohs added.\nThe roster grew illustrious: Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, John Coltrane, James Brown and heavyweight champ Joe Louis all called it home.\n\u201cThey all resided in this neighborhood around the same time in the \u201940s and \u201950s,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is when the neighborhood started to change.\u201d\nFor the Robinsons, the move brought mixed blessings. Fans flocked to their doorstep, eager for glimpses of the family.\n\u201cUsually, Rachel was diplomatic with the intruders,\u201d Jackie Robinson later wrote. \u201cBut some of the liberties people took got on her nerves.\u201d\nSeeking privacy, they relocated to Stamford, Connecticut, in 1954. Yet their Queens legacy endures, tied to a neighborhood that became a symbol of racial progress.\nThe current owner, who bought the residence in 2005 for $525,000, is now downsizing.\n\u201cBoth of [the] children moved out. One is in college, obtaining a law degree, and the other one is just moved out and starting on her own,\u201d Morency-Mohs said. \u201cSo [the owner] was like, \u2018I don\u2019t need a big home, but I don\u2019t want to let go of this piece of history. I don\u2019t wanna sell my home. So now it\u2019s time to lease it out.\u2019\u201d\nRenovated over the years, the house retains its original layout and woodburning fireplaces.\nToday, Addisleigh Park commands premium prices, with homes averaging under $1 million, but recently trading above that threshold.\nDesignated a historic district in 2011, the immediate area boasts a tight-knit community with holiday events and monthly meetings.\u00a0Easy access to transportation is an added perk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an under-the-radar community and also it\u2019s walking distance to the Long Island Railroad. So someone can be in the city during rush hour and in like 15 to 18 minutes. It is also 15 minutes to JFK Airport,\u201d she said.\nSet on an 11,000-square-foot lot, the rental additionally features a formal living room with a fireplace, a dining room, a galley kitchen, a sunroom and a sprawling backyard \u2014 steps from parks and schools.\nRobinson was the first black person to play in Major League Baseball.\nOver the course of his decade-long MLB career, he earned the first-ever Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, secured All-Star status for six straight seasons from 1949 to 1954, and claimed the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949, becoming the first black player to receive this accolade.\nRobinson participated in six World Series. In 1962, his inaugural year of eligibility, he was enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn 1972, he died of a heart attack at age 53 at his Stamford home.\nAdvertisement",

We just won a championship, and in the same way they expect us to level up and step up our game, our ownership group and leadership continues to raise the bar, and this facility is a perfect example of that.\u201d\nStewart added, \u201cThe Liberty made this facility a true player-led endeavor, incorporating our insights to help us be our best, while strengthening our bond as a team and with the New York community.\u201d\nThe development blends old and new: the original factory\u2019s brick and timber structure will house offices, a media room and a broadcast studio, while a 40,000-square-foot addition will contain most player amenities.\nFans won\u2019t be left out, with plans for a retail and hospitality zone offering an \u201cimmersive experience.\u201d\nGeneral Manager Jonathan Kolb framed it as a competitive edge.\n\u201cThe New York Liberty strive to be the standard on and off the court and this facility will be a game changer as we continue our relentless pursuit of excellence. A key part of this process has been the active involvement of our players in creating a year-round home for themselves and their families, and the collaborative effort to redefine the standard of player care and experience.\u201d\nThe Liberty\u2019s momentum follows a banner 2024 season, with home attendance at Barclays Center surging 64% since their 2019 move to Brooklyn, capped by a citywide celebration of their first championship.\n\nAdvertisement",

Moreover, if it sells at ask, it would also mark the priciest sale ever completed on the island.\nThe most recent sales record there was broken in early 2024, when one of the first families ever to reside on the islandsold their co-opof 47 years for $2.09 million.\nLocated at 415 Main St. within the coveted Riverwalk Court, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom residence spans 1,433 square feet and offers sweeping vistas of Manhattan\u2019s skyline and the East River, all framed by towering floor-to-ceiling windows.\nThe unit is one of just two three-bedroom offerings on the building\u2019s penthouse level.\nInside, the open-concept design blends a generous living and dining space with a chef\u2019s kitchen featuring granite countertops, high-end appliances and abundant natural light.\nThe layout includes two ensuite bedrooms among three total \u2014 all accented by marble-clad bathrooms, 12-foot ceilings and plentiful storage. Additional perks include an in-unit washer/dryer and a private storage cage.\nRiverwalk Court also delivers a suite of upscale amenities: round-the-clock concierge service, a fitness center, a yoga studio, a children\u2019s playroom, an entertainment lounge, and a rooftop terrace showcasing panoramic city and river views.\nThe listing is represented by Greg Kyroglou of Modern Spaces, who originally brokered the property\u2019s sale to its current owners in 2013 for $1.5 million.\nThose owners, previously residents of Long Island City, were drawn to Roosevelt Island\u2019s calmer ambience and proximity to urban life.\n\u201cOnce they started seeing their options and how unique Roosevelt Island was and how intimate it was and how you walk around and it\u2019s very quiet,\u201d said Kyroglou, it sealed the deal.\nNow, the sellers aren\u2019t straying far.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just downsizing,\u201d Kyroglou added. \u201cThey\u2019re actually buying in the building \u2026 It\u2019s a three-bed, three bath unit and they\u2019re starting to travel more. So it made sense for them to downsize.\u201d\nThe penthouse\u2019s $2.4 million price tag reflects its standout features, Kyroglou added.\n\u201cJust in terms of size, it is over 1,400 square feet \u2026 you have full Manhattan views with the bridge and the trolley, so you see the tram,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a very unique setup in terms of the price. And that\u2019s why we kind of priced it aggressively.\u201d\nFor context, Kyroglou pointed to a neighboring property at 425 Main St., where an 11th-floor unit with 1,280 square feet and two bathrooms is under contract for $2.1 million.\n\u201cSo if you take that as a comp, we\u2019re actually priced pretty well,\u201d he said.\nThe listing highlights Roosevelt Island\u2019s appeal as a residential haven that balances seclusion with accessibility.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique setup where you can be between Manhattan and Queens and kind of get the best of both worlds right there,\u201d Kyroglou said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "ByMadeline Bilis\nEvery year \u2014 sometimes as early as February \u2014 Sept. 1 apartment vacancies start popping up around Boston. For renters in search of a new place, it marks the beginning of an open season of sorts, where thousands of people shuffle in for apartment tours across the city.\nAlthough roughlytwo-thirds of all leases in Bostonturn over on Sept. 1, it can still be a challenge to find the rental of your dreams. Beyond looking early and staying organized, there are some lesser-known tips and tricks for scoring your ideal apartment. So if you\u2019re on the hunt for a Sept. 1 lease, read these tips from the professionals.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of renter who knows exactly which neighborhood you\u2019d like to live in, try digging into the data, according to Demetrios Salpoglou, CEO ofBoston Pads, an apartment-listing website. Most neighborhoods have a month where the number of lease renewal notifications peaks; in other words, that\u2019s when the most apartments hit the market there.\nIn East Boston, for example,data from BostonPadsshows that real-time availability spikes in May. \u201cYou can see the increase in inventory going up and down in real time,\u201d Salpoglou said.\nSo if you\u2019re set on moving to Eastie, you\u2019ll have plenty of places to choose from come May. Bylooking at the numbers(and the graphs), you can figure out when to start searching in neighborhoods from Allston to Roslindale.\nDo you love a particular building but never see units for rent there? Try talking to the property manager directly.\n\u201cAs a property manager myself, I can tell you: We usually know which units will be turning over before anything goes live online,\u201d said Tony DiMarsico, broker and owner atNFP Realty. \u201cIn fact, I already have a list of Sept. 1 availabilities that aren\u2019t posted anywhere yet. A quick email or call to a management company can sometimes get you ahead of the pack.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not usually a good idea to start touring apartments if you\u2019re not ready to sign a lease and pay the move-in costs that day. \u201cThe Boston market moves so fast that apartments can get rented within hours,\u201d said Emily Downs, a real estate professional withKingston Real Estate & Managementin Brookline.\nIf you find something you love, come prepared with everything you need, such as a checkbook or enough funds in your account to complete an online payment.\n\u201cIf you really like a particular apartment and it looks like there are going to be multiple groups interested, it\u2019s a good idea to fill out an application ahead of your tour and learn what deposits, if any, are due upon application,\u201d Downs added. If needed, you can even put down a deposit during the tour.\nHowever, this maneuver is a voluntary way to give yourself a leg up over the competition. A broker should not ask for any money up front. \u201cYou areneverrequired to pay money to take a tour of an apartment,\u201d Downs said. \u201cIf someone is asking you for money to take a tour, they are a scammer.\u201d\nSome apartments linger on the market for months without being rented. When that\u2019s the case, you have a bit of negotiating power.\n\u201cIf you see an apartment that\u2019s been out there for 90 days, why not throw in an offer?\u201d Salpoglou said. You could suggest paying a few hundred dollars less than the listing price, for example.\n\u201cA landlord may just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve had enough,\u2019\u201d and rent it at a discount, he said.\nTry sorting your search by \u201cdays on market\u201d to find these units, or set an alert to track a given apartment for price reductions, allowing you to swoop in quickly.\nThe bottom line? Don\u2019t scroll past the so-called less desirable listings. \u201cThe ones with blurry photos or typos usually get ignored \u2014 but if you\u2019re willing to take a look, you might find a great unit that others overlooked simply because the listing wasn\u2019t polished,\u201d DiMarsico added.\nMany tenants who rent apartments on Sept. 1 lease cycles are students, meaning they might leave the city after classes end in June. In those cases, it\u2019s common to secure subletters for the summer.\n\u201cA lot of June-to-August sublets come with the option to extend, and those tenants are often eager to hand things off early,\u201d DiMarsico said. He called it the backdoor in: Move in as a subletter in June, and then at the end of the summer, sign a Sept. 1 lease to stay there as a tenant for another year.\n\u201cYou might score a great place and even get discounted rent or free furniture in the process,\u201d he added.\nEver see one of those cardboard \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs tacked up in a window? Those are often the ticket to a hidden gem. Consider driving or walking around a neighborhood you\u2019d like to live in to find one.\n\u201cIt sounds basic, but it works. Some landlords still rely on those simple \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs in the window instead of listing online,\u201d DiMarsico said. \u201cI actually found my own house during college this way \u2014 just driving around and jotting down numbers.\u201d\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

It\u2019s a one-of-one trophy asset that can\u2019t be replicated.\u201d\nCompleting the space to an elite standard could add another $10 million, he estimates.\n\u201cIf they were to spend about another $10 million on the restoration, they would get something ultra-luxury that nobody else has in Dubai at very, very high standards,\u201d Khan added. \u201cAnd I think it needs to have that level of spend on it to warrant a profitable outcome at the end when we come to resell it.\u201d\nThe property boasts exclusive perks: a private indoor pool, a dedicated elevator system \u2014 requiring a 2-minute, two-lift journey from the ground to the top \u2014 and 12 parking spaces.\n\u201cThe elevators and the lifts are super, super fast,\u201d Khan said. \u201cOne gets you to the 73rd floor, and then from 73rd, there\u2019s another lift that gets you to 107th or 108th, and they both take about a minute each.\u201d\nThe seller, Karl Haddad, chairman and CEO of IRC Invest, acquired the unit in 2020 from Emaar Properties founder Mohamed Alabbar for an undisclosed sum.\nKhan says Haddad, an investor juggling multiple ventures, lacks the bandwidth to oversee the buildout.\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy with other projects and other businesses that he has and doesn\u2019t have the time to run such a project,\u201d Khan told Business Insider. \u201cHe\u2019s not a developer, he\u2019s not a builder, or a designer \u2014 that\u2019s not his game.

But we\u2019ve had so much interest from the US that it\u2019s been overwhelming, and even several offers as well.\u201d\nProspective buyers include agents representing Hollywood actors, sports figures \u2014 ranging from basketball players to NASCAR drivers \u2014 and even a rapper, we hear. Boxing icon Floyd Mayweather is among those who\u2019ve inquired.\n\u201cThey\u2019re from various walks of life,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe had a huge amount of inquiries in the US \u2014 and I don\u2019t know why that is.\u201d\nDubai\u2019s allure for Americans may tie to its booming population, up 3.85 million since March 2020, with expatriates accounting for 87% of that growth, per government figures.\nThe city\u2019s luxury real estate market is sizzling, with the Burj Khalifa\u2019s 900 residential units fetching between $623,000 and $27.2 million, according to Bayut, a real estate portal.\nKhan sees the penthouse as a status symbol for globe-trotting elites rather than a primary home.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to live in it because the kind of people that we\u2019ve been approached by \u2014 these people are traveling all around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of a status symbol. \u2018I\u2019ve got this,\u2019 or \u2018I will have this.\u2019 It just adds to the portfolio.\u201d\nIf finished within 12 to 18 months \u2014 a timeline Khan deems feasible \u2014 the property could double in value, he predicts.\n\u201cWhoever takes this project on \u2014 and if they do it to the ultrawealthy level that it deserves \u2014 they will be rewarded accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe supply is not there \u2014 the demand is there for buyers.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "If this terrace were a theater, the city would be its stage.\nTommy Tune, the famed 10-time Tony Award-winning choreographer, performer and director, has relisted his Manhattan penthouse for $2.9 million, Gimme Shelter has learned.\nThe charming Beekman/Sutton Place dwelling comes with a dramatic, 2,075-square-foot terrace where Tune held some memorable soir\u00e9es over the years.\n\u201cI had a party for [the late actress] Carol Channing and 200 Broadway friends showed up,\u201d Tune told Gimme by email.\nThe penthouse, at 400 E. 52nd St., is in an Emery Roth-designed building developed by Bing & Bing in the late 1920s and early 1930s that was last on the market in 2022 for $2.2 million \u2014 $700,000 less than its current asking price.\nThe one-bedroom, one-bathroom residence is 900 square feet.\nKnown as the Tower, it comes with a stage- and dance-worthy terrace featuring stunning river and city views.\n\u201cThere are so many things I love about the Tower,\u201d Tune told Gimme. \u201cI love that you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the Tower, and I love that I can host a party on my terrace.\u201d\n\u201cI also love that 52nd Street is a dead-end street. You really get to know everyone on the block \u2014 even [actress] Uma Thurman,\u201d Tune quipped.\nTune also found it an inspiring place to create art. \u201cI\u2019ve created over 100 paintings in the Tower,\u201d Tune said, adding that he also loves \u201csoaking in my Jacuzzi and I can see the Chrysler Building.\u201d\nDesign details inside the penthouse include 13-foot ceilings \u2014 which Tune particularly appreciates for his 6-foot-6.5-inch frame. There are also hardwood floors, stage lighting and lots of windows to showcase scenic views.\nThe home opens to a great room with a dining area and a chef\u2019s kitchen. There\u2019s also a sunlit bedroom.\nThe landscaped roof deck features an outdoor shower and an artist\u2019s sink.\nTune, 86, bought the penthouse in 2007 for around $1.3 million, according to reports.\nThe building turned co-op in 1987.\nIt is in one of five Emery Roth-designed co-op buildings that make up a complex called Southgate, which has more than 400 units. Building amenities include a doorman, a live-in resident manager, a garden, a laundry room, a bike room and individual storage for rent or purchase.\n\u201cI love the community that Southgate offers,\u201d Tune said.\nDouglas Elliman broker Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a \u201cRHONY\u201d reality TV star alum who is listing Tune\u2019s apartment, agreed.\nAs for the up-leveled price, she told Gimme: \u201cIt\u2019s rare to see such an iconic living space coupled with a vast outdoor terrace in the heart of the illustrious Beekman and Sutton Place neighborhoods.\n\u201cWith supply and demand, scarcity and limited inventory being the characteristics of the new real estate archetype, this penthouse is like a Birkin [bag]. It is rare \u2014 like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Bensimon added.\nTune also owns an additional penthouse in the Southgate complex at 414 E. 52nd St., which was also on the market for four months last year \u2014 for $2.3 million \u2014 before it was delisted in July. The listing brokers were Corcoran\u2019s Leighton Candler, Jennifer Reardon and Bradley Comisar. That\u2019s also a one-bedroom, one-bath penthouse with a wrap terrace showcasing river and city views.\nTune bought that unit, which was once a ballroom with 12-foot ceilings, for close to $1.4 million in 2013 \u2014 and enjoyed entertaining there, playing croquet on the terrace and hosting fireworks parties with guests like Lauren Bacall,according to the New York Times.\nThe beloved Texan-born icon, who has become synonymous with Broadway and entertaining over the decades, also owns a home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nAdvertisement",

That was its most recent asking price \u2014 and the aerie made headlines earlier this year for being the priciest rental available in Queens.\nThat said, that price ties this apartment witha mansion in Little Neckas the most expensive residence ever rented in Queens.\nWhile the new renters get less space in this unit than its Little Neck counterpart, they certainly get better views. The penthouse at Skyline Tower towers 778 feet above street level.\nThe tower also offers residents a 24/7 doorman and concierge services, a community play area, a roof deck, a game room, a pet spa and a 75-foot-pool. Plus, it\u2019s one subway stop from Manhattan.\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom condo attracted a great deal of interest since itrelisted for $11,500 in January, according to Corcoran agent Michael Chadwick.\n\u201cAt one point I was talking with the reps for two professional baseball players and an ambassador from a foreign country,\u201d Chadwick said in a statement. \u201cEveryone wanted this apartment!\u201d\nDespite the competition, Mitchell and Bee Miles won out. Mitchell is an entrepreneur, a Christian influencer and a mental health advocate, according to his personal website. He founded the business consulting company NeWell.

The key system in her building was more like a hotel, using key cards rather than the traditional metal keys.\n\u201cSo the doors to all of the apartments in the building were a key card system. So it wasn\u2019t like a key that you had to turn and lock. It was just like a hotel key card that you would scan and the door would open,\u201d she went on.\n\u201cObviously, you need a key card to open the door, but they also had a deadbolt for an extra layer of protection.\u201d\nBartlett admitted that often, when she slept, she would just close the door and not deadbolt it because the man she was dating at the time would sometimes come by later and had his own key.\n\u201cOne very, very random weeknight, around 11:45 to midnight, I was going to bed. I had, like, taken my melatonin, my phone was on \u2018do not disturb,\u2019 and I was about to fall asleep. I was kind of halfway asleep,\u201d she recalled.\n\u201cAnd since the doors had an electric system, they were very heavy doors, so they would make a very loud noise when they would open or close. So I heard the door open, but this was not a weird thing to happen. Like I said, I thought this was my boyfriend at the time.\u201d\nHowever, what seemed innocent turned out to be the influencer\u2019s worst nightmare as she quickly discovered that the man who had entered her home was not her boyfriend.\n\u201cI would say five minutes went by, and I was hearing rustling around and somebody trying to turn on the light switches \u2014 which were kind of hard to turn on \u2014 moving things around,\u201d Bartlett added. \u201cSo eventually, I\u2019m just like, \u2018Hello, hello?\u2019 and I am calling out his name and I hear a man\u2019s voice say, \u2018No, this is housekeeping.'\u201d\nThe 25-year-old confessed that her \u201cheart sunk to my feet\u201d in that moment, and she began looking around for what she could use to protect herself, eventually grabbing her tripod as a weapon before inching toward the living room to confront the intruder.\n\u201cI hear this man running out, and the door slams shut. I open the door, and I see a man running down the hallway and running down the stairs. I called my building, I called the police. The doorman came, and basically everyone in the building told me that they didn\u2019t believe me, which was really horrible, and they literally asked me if I was hallucinating.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cNext night, the same thing happens to another girl in the same building. Everybody finally believes me now. A few days pass, and they actually end up catching this man in the service elevator,\u201d she added.\nHowever, the influencer revealed that the police were unable to make an arrest.\n\u201cBecause my building did not have any \u2018No trespassing\u2019 signs anywhere, legally, they couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo they just had to let him go. The same thing happened to about I want to say three or four women in the building I was living in, and I really don\u2019t think that it was targeted, but I actually don\u2019t know.\n\u201cMonths later, finally they were able to arrest him or do something. I don\u2019t actually know what they did, I moved out.\u201d\nAt the end of the clip, the content creator urged fans to lock their doors even if they are living in a \u201cluxury building.\u201d\nPeople on the web flocked to the comments section and expressed their shock at the situation, as many thanked the influencer for sharing her story.\nAccording to attorneyGirvin Ferlazzo, \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs are not mandatory in New York City and trespassing can still be considered illegal if there are no signs posted.\nAdvertisement",

It\u2019s in my blood.\u201d\nBut now, Douglass has listed his own apartment \u2014 in what social commentator Tom Wolfe dubbed one of the city\u2019s \u201cGood Buildings\u201d \u2014 for $4.29 million.\nHe bought the three-bedroom, three-bathroom co-op in 2015 for $3.55 million, according to property records.\nThe eighth-floor unit opens to a foyer that leads to a large living room with high ceilings, herringbone floors, a restored marble woodburning fireplace and large picture windows overlooking the water. There\u2019s also an eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen and a butler\u2019s pantry with a wet bar and wine storage.\nThe main bedroom features a large walk-in closet and an ensuite bath. The home also boasts lots of storage, custom closets and surround sound.\nThe couple aren\u2019t in the city as much anymore, spending more time in \u201cwarmer locales.\u201d (Pres. Donald Trump nominated Douglass to be the US ambassador to the Bahamas during his first term, but Pres. Joe Biden rescinded the offer.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u00a0bittersweet decision, but it\u2019s time for someone else to create new memories here.

This Winthrop condo could be your dream home.\nListed at $299,000, 203 Winthrop Shore Drive Apartment 8 is a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 764 square feet. Located on the fourth floor of an eight-unit building that was constructed in 1900 and converted to condos in 2004, the unit provides stunning views of Winthrop Beach.\nClimb up a series of steps to the common entrance, which is on the side of the building. Then head up several flights of stairs to the unit\u2019s entrance, which welcomes you in the 142-square-foot living room that was freshly painted this year. Featuring oak floors, a vaulted ceiling, and oversized beams, the space has a ceiling fan that will provide additional breezes during the summer. The living room has a trio of windows that stream in natural light off the ocean. It also has a closet.\n\u201cIt has a great water view from the living room,\u201d saidCharles Roderickof eXp Realty, who has thelisting.\nContinue down the hallway to the 95-square-foot kitchen, which features white cabinetry and laminate countertops. Compact stainless steel appliances, which were purchased in 2018, include a dishwasher, an electric range, and a refrigerator. A single window provides plenty of natural light, and the kitchen also provides a second exit through the back staircase.\nNext door is the bathroom, which features a gray tiled shower that includes a seated area inside. There\u2019s a white vanity and a single window.\nWhite French doors open to the corner bedroom, a 225-square-foot space with two bright windows with south and west exposures. The window with a western exposure reveals the skyline of downtown Boston at a distance. The bedroom also has a closet.\nThe home has a monthly HOA fee of $442, which includes flood insurance. In the basement, you\u2019ll find community coin-operated washers and dryers, and the unit\u2019s separate storage space, which Roderick estimates measures around 30 square feet. The unit comes with one off-street parking space, and guest parking is also available. If driving isn\u2019t your thing, Winthrop has several MBTA bus lines that connect to downtown Boston.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "By Billy Baker, The Boston Globe\n\nIf you\u2019ve got $20 million to spend and a one-story indoor slide is on your list of must-haves, an estate has popped on the market in Weston that could meet your needs.\n\nThe home, at67 Byron Road, is listed for $19,850,000, and is billed as \u201ctimeless elegance meets modern luxury,\u201d but with a hint of Chuck-E-Cheese thrown in. In addition to the two-story tube slide, there is a Winnie the Pooh-themed bedroom, a sci-fi vibe game room, a Scrabble-themed bathroom, and a wine cellar that looks like the setting for where the spies exchange microfilm in a thriller.\n\nBy comparison, the home movie theater and indoor basketball court are relatively subdued, in that they look like a traditional movie theater and basketball court. (Alas, it\u2019s only half-court, but the tube-slide takes you there from the game room above.)\n\n\nThe home, which was built in 2002, clocks in with seven bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a 4-car garage, and a whopping 18,725-square-feet of living space. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the interior is a grand staircase adorned colorful geometric shapes. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of contemporary art, but that can be removed,\u201d saidMaggie Gold Seelig, the realtor who is handling the sale. \u201cThat does come with the home but that can either be removed by the next owner and either sold or donated.\u201d\n\n\nWhen the property last hit the market, for $17 million back in 2013,Curbedcalled it a \u201ckooky, cringe-worthy mansion.\u201d The home was then owned by Jeffrey Vinik, a minority owner of the Boston Red Sox who was reportedly moving to be closer to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Florida NHL franchise he\u2019d bought three years prior.\n\nNow that it\u2019s back on the market,Boston Magazinehas compared it to the king of bizarro Massachusetts homes, the full-blownamusement park mansionbuilt by the founder of the Yankee Candle Company.\n\n\nBut while the interior is filled with idiosyncratic choices, the exterior is more adult and refined, a blend of modern and traditional with arcing roof lines and an outdoor entertaining area worthy of a resort.\n\nAn expansive granite patio leads to two swimming pools, a pool house, and an apple orchard. Plenty of room for the adults to relax and entertain while the kids run around the Willy Wonka mansion inside.\n\n\n\u201cThe house is filled with a lot of whimsy,\u201d Seelig said. \u201cIt\u2019s warm, it\u2019s inviting, it can seat a lot of people for entertaining, or for cozy nights in.\u201d\n\n\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "28-year-old MIT grad Burhan Azeem is leading big housing efforts, quietly",
        "content": "The pressure was tightening on Burhan Azeem.Azeem, a 28-year-old, second-term Cambridge city councilor, was working to advance a controversial proposal he hoped could solve the city\u2019s deep housing shortage: allowing six-story multifamily buildings anywhere in Cambridge. Opposition from some neighborhood groups was growing, and he needed to swing the momentum.Azeem decided to play small-ball, visiting community groups to make his case. In one instance, Azeem appealed to a synagogue, noting that its members cannot drive on the Sabbath, and therefore, he said, would benefit from living in dense housing near public transit.It was a small but meaningful expression of the political savvy that has helped Azeem transform Cambridge\u2019s approach to building new homes.Since being elected in 2021, Azeem has helped write and pass some of the broadest housing reforms Cambridge, or anywhere else in Massachusetts, has seen in years \u2014 including the six-story zoning, which passed in February and is regarded as one of the most ambitious efforts to spur new housing by any city in the country.\u201cPeople support me because I write policies that have a real chance to make a difference in the housing crisis,\u201d Azeem said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t doing that, I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job.\u201dRelated: In dramatic overhaul, Cambridge becomes one of the first cities in Mass. to eliminate single-family zoningAdvertisementAzeem\u2019s political rise, and policy success, has coincided with housing emerging as one of the most important local issues in Massachusetts, and a growing movement of younger, politically engaged residents who are pushing for solutions. In Cambridge \u2014 which has some of the steepest rents in the nation \u2014 that is especially true.AdvertisementTo the younger residents advocating for more homes, Azeem is an ideal representative.\u201cHousing is the preeminent challenge in the lives of a lot of people who live here,\u201d said Jarred Johnson, a local advocate who supports Azeem. \u201cSo when someone like Burhan comes along and presents a clear vision to deal with that problem and actually follows through on it, people respond to that.\u201dAzeem said his fixation on the housing shortage is personal. He was born in Pakistan, then moved to Staten Island, N.Y., when he was 4 after his parents won a visa lottery, hoping to pay off medical debt with new, better-paying jobs. In the United States, his family moved often, sometimes staying with friends in overcrowded apartments.Azeem excelled in high school \u2014 a local newspaper once referred to him as a genius \u2014 and won a full scholarship to MIT, where he studied material science and engineering. These days, Azeem is the head of artificial intelligence at Tandem, a language learning startup.Cambridge City Councilors Burhan Azeem (left) and Sumbul Siddiqui discussed their proposal to allow six-story buildings in Cambridge.\nErin Clark/Globe StaffHis natural approach as an engineer is to look at Cambridge\u2019s housing problem from an analytical perspective. The numbers bear out that Cambridge has too few homes for the number of people who want to live there, he said, and the city builds too slowly. Add the surge of well-paying biotech jobs over the last decade, and housing prices are going to explode.Azeem estimates he has spent, conservatively, hundreds of hours poring over the city\u2019s zoning code, and he\u2019ll happily discuss floor-area-ratio (a measure of a building\u2019s floor area in relation to the size of the land on which it sits) and other housing wonkery that quietly shapes cities. But he can expound, too, on big ideas, like why the country doesn\u2019t build big infrastructure projects anymore, and how Greater Boston would be better off with a much larger MBTA.Advertisement\u201cI get labeled as a dreamer because I look at issues like housing and transportation and suggest solutions that upend the status quo and get to the root of the problem,\u201d Azeem said. \u201cWell right now, the status quo is people spending half their income on housing, and a broken transportation system.\u201dEvery April 1 on social media platforms, Azeem proposes that Cambridge become \u201cMegaCambridge\u201d by absorbing Boston. Last year, he put up billboards advertising the idea, and this year, he introduced a formal resolution at the City Council. It\u2019s an April Fool\u2019s joke, he said, but the message behind it \u2014 that cities should think and function more as a broader region instead of individual municipalities \u2014 is serious.Related: The YIMBYs are coming, to the suburbsIt is the combination of those two worlds of thinking, about the intricacies of zoning and big vision for what a city should be, that inform Azeem\u2019s work on housing policy.\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about ideas on housing for years and years,\u201d said Councilor Marc McGovern. \u201cBurhan made sure we actually did something with those conversations.\u201dIn consecutive years, in 2022 and 2023, Azeem helped pass an ordinance that banned minimum parking requirements for new developments \u2014 lowering a major cost of new construction \u2014 and changes to the city\u2019s affordable housing overlay to ease approvals of affordable projects as tall as 12 to 15 stories in some sections of the city.Both of those proposals were controversial and passed the council by close margins. So when Azeem, along with councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, suggested the city allow buildings up to six stories tall on any lot, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in Cambridge and promoting dense housing in even lower-slung neighborhoods, it felt like a long shot. A few years prior, a similar proposal died in committee.Advertisement\u201cWhen I first started talking to him about this, I was incredibly impressed with his economic substance, and thought he was enormously ignorant politically,\u201d said Jason Furman, an influential Harvard economist and former adviser to President Barack Obama, whom Azeem consulted on the proposal. \u201cI saw a guy obsessed with his idea who had no idea of the political hurdles he had to pass.\u201dBut, Furman said, Azeem\u2019s penchant for big ideas hides his political calculus.\u201cClearly,\u201d he said, \u201cI was wrong.\u201dThe Sacred Heart Rectory at 49 6th Street in East Cambridge is the future site of an affordable housing development that will have no parking spaces.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, the pro-housing movement can occasionally be known for that sort of thing: big ideas, with too little political acumen to persuade everyday voters. But Azeem has been adept at allying with politically savvy councilors to help push his ideas forward.\u201cBurhan\u2019s superpower is that he is a regular person who is genuinely interested in connecting with the people he represents,\u201d said Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director of Abundant Housing, which Azeem helped found.And it may work in his favor that he can be shy and is not a Type A backslapper like many other politicians, said Kanson-Benanav, because it means he tends to prefer one-on-one conversations, which can endear him to people. At his election night party in 2023, he spent most of the evening in the corner chatting with a few people, even as the crowd of 20- and 30-somethings loudly cheered and celebrated his reelection.Related: Cambridge passes new affordable housing rules, paving the way for taller buildingsAdvertisementStill, his style and the scale of his ideas have rubbed some in town the wrong way.The Cambridge Citizens Coalition, a local group that advocates for slower growth, has frequently criticized Azeem, saying his policies are reckless and will mainly lead to the development of expensive condominiums instead of housing affordable for everyday people. Last year, after Azeem himself bought a small multifamily property near Fresh Pond, they accused him of potentially profiting from his own upzoning proposal, which would enable a much larger property there.The group declined to comment for this story.But that is the nature of debate over local housing policy these days. Discussions can be personal, because the issue is so personal for so many people.Azeem\u2019s response is to talk with as many people as he can. He knows not everyone will agree with his ideas, but that\u2019s not a reason to stop pushing for them. And sometimes it works. Like in February, when Azeem\u2019s six-story zoning plan passed the City Council 8-1.It\u2019s the sort of proposal that could get people voted out of office in a lot of places. But here, it paid off, and Cambridge may never look the same.\u201cI would be doing a disservice to the people that elected me if I didn\u2019t try to pass real solutions to our problems,\u201d said Azeem. \u201cThat\u2019s what politics should really be about, right?\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "subhead": "For those with disabilities, it starts with getting in and out of the house.",
        "content": "By  Megan Johnson, The Boston Globe\n\nAfter his neck was broken on April 30, 2021, when the Uber he was riding in crashed into a parked car in Somerville, Will Good had to learn to navigate life in a power wheelchair.\n\nNow paralyzed from the neck down, Good, 34, spent several months at Massachusetts General and Spaulding Rehabilitation hospitals to care for the spinal cord injury he suffered in the accident. When the time came for his release that September, the Somerville apartment where he previously lived wouldn\u2019t accommodate his needs. Good would have to learn to function in a world where the design scheme is generally inhospitable to those with disabilities.\n\nWhile more thanone in four American adultshas a disability, it\u2019s not just younger people like Good who face challenges in their homes\u2019 design. As baby boomers enter their retirement years, many will face issues that require accommodation. But with78 percent of baby boomersnationally planning to age in place, according to Redfin, their  homes likely aren\u2019t equipped to sustain them.\n\nOnly about10 percent of homesnationwide are fully prepared for senior living, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. No matter the resident\u2019s age, accessible homes are in great demand.\n\nEach year, Rick Castino, president ofOperation Independence, a home accessibility construction company based in Watertown, gets an increasing number of inquiries from people concerned about their home\u2019s accessibility.\n\n\u201cBy 2040 or 50, there\u2019s going to be a huge population of people over 65 who are going to be faced with staying in their house or not,\u201d said Castino. Some of the inquiries he receives are urgent, \u201cbecause we get a lot of folks who suddenly have a stroke, or they\u2019re in a car accident, or we do a fair amount with kids who were born with physical challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of the first concerns tackled should be getting in and out of the home, since most houses have front steps. Linda Merrill, a Duxbury-based interior designer, notes thatrampsneed 1 foot for 1 inch of elevation.\n\n\u201cIf your best access door is 30 inches off the ground, you need 30 feet of ramp,\u201d said Merrill, who educated herself on accessible design after her father had a stroke. \u201cYou need it to not be so steep that someone couldn\u2019t roll their wheelchair in.\u201d\n\nMerrill also notes that door jams need to be completely flat and threshold-free. Doorways, which can be particularly narrow in historic New England homes, often need to be widened beyond32 inches, according to the state\u2019s Architectural Access Board.\n\nThe bathroom is one of the most challenging spaces to navigate. Grab bars are helpful for fall prevention, and higher toilets make it easier to get up again. The installation of threshold-free or roll-in showers provides the ability to bathe.\n\n\u201cYou can roll right in. You don\u2019t trip. It\u2019s the most accessible way to bathe in a bathroom,\u201d said Castino, who notes that removing traditional bathtubs is one of his most frequent jobs.\n\nFor those returning from rehab or inpatient care, it\u2019s important to have a trained professional evaluate your home before your return. If you\u2019re tackling renovations now but aren\u2019t yet having mobility issues, Merrill said it is wise to get things done you\u2019ll likely need later. In a bathroom, installing extra blocking in the walls will allow grab bars to be put in easily later.\n\n\u201cIf you needed to install grab bars, you have something you can install them on. You don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s not an expensive thing to add, because it\u2019s just more wood,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cNobody thinks they\u2019re going to be in a wheelchair. But they might think, \u2018Well, I might be weak.\u2019 If you never need it, great. And if you do need it, it\u2019s less work to put in.\u201d\n\nOne of the most common issues is stairs. While some people can afford $40,000 home elevators, Castino noted that a stair lift is the most economical way to move between floors. However, they start around $4,000, and can be much more expensive for a curved staircase.\n\nBrian Harvey, owner ofHarvey Home Modificationsin Natick, noted that transitioning to single-floor living is a common alternative for homeowners looking to avoid stairs.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of houses in Newton and the Greater Boston area where there\u2019s not even a half bathroom on the first floor,\u201d said Harvey. \u201cFolks don\u2019t want to necessarily move out of their communities, because if they\u2019ve paid down their mortgage, there are no more affordable housing options.\u201d\n\nInstead, Harvey will take the existing first-floor space and make it completely self-sufficient with the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom all on the first floor. That also can free up space for someone to move in upstairs, if need be.\n\nTo minimize the risk of falling, hazards like floor rugs should be avoided. In some cases, slip-resistant flooring should be installed. Lighting modifications \u2014 such as installing enough bright white or daylight bulbs \u2014 help reduce glare for people with vision issues.\n\nGood moved into a two-bedroom unit across the hall from his aunt in South Boston. It was modified through the stateHome Modification Loan Program, which provides Massachusetts residents with disabilities or those who are over 60 with zero-interest loans for home modifications. The building was previously made more accessible due to Massachusetts\u201930 percent rule, which states that if renovations exceed 30 percent of the property\u2019s value, full accessibility requirements must be fulfilled.\n\n\nDoorways were widened to accommodate Good\u2019s wheelchair, and shelves were mounted onto the walls to clear up floor space. The tub was removed to create a wet room, and an overhead lift was installed in the bedroom to transfer Good from his wheelchair to the bed. He and his partner, Vita Brown, have filled the South Boston condo with their art and musical instruments. They painted the walls and put several pieces of their record collection on display.\n\n\u201cI like to say we\u2019ve made it move-in proof if you were just a regular person trying to buy a condo because it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s style,\u201d said Good. \u201cBut it\u2019s very much ours.\u201d\n\nMegan Johnson can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "The Big Apple just got bigger \u2014 at least when it comes to the price of this newly listed \u201cquadplex\u201d penthouse.\nOn Thursday, according to StreetEasy, this four-level nest listed at 111 W. 57th St. on Manhattan\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row \u2014 the building itself being the skinniest skyscraper on the planet and the second-tallest residential building in the United States.\nListed for $110 million, moreover, the grand unit is now the priciest for sale in New York City, StreetEasy additionally shows.\nEvery unit in 111 W. 57th St., also known as Steinway Tower, takes up at least one full floor, but Penthouse 80 at the tippy top takes up four.\nSteinway Tower is iconic for its lithe facade, which pierces the sky like a needle, but with a pinnacle whose design resembles a feather. It has a slenderness ratio of 1 to 24, meaning it\u2019s 24 times as tall as it is wide. That makes it the skinniest skyscraper in the world. For reference, the slenderness ratio of the Empire State Building is 1 to 3.\nThe dwelling spans 11,480 square feet over the 80th to 83rd floors, with 618 square feet of exterior terraces.\nThe lofty residence, the listing of which wasfirst reported by Bloomberg, boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and 14-foot ceilings. It currently includes five bedrooms and six full bathrooms.\nThe vacant condo\u2019s suggested floor plan was designed by Studio Sofield, but the $110 million asking price includes a full buildout and redesign, if an ultra-wealthy buyer so chooses.\nCurrently, the first floor \u2014 on the building\u2019s 80th story \u2014 includes a grand entry hall and a south-facing kitchen with access to an outdoor terrace.\nFour bedrooms take up the second floor, each with an ensuite bathroom, as well a lounge area and a wet bar.\nThe third floor is taken up by a 2,800-square-foot primary suite, which boasts two ensuite bathrooms \u2014 one clad in gray onyx and the other in white onyx. The final and fourth floor, the \u201ccrown suite,\u201d was made for lavish parties, with a bar, a private screening room, a service kitchen and an outdoor terrace.\nA quadplex in Manhattan is rare indeed. Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffinfamously snagged onein 2019 at nearby 220 Central Park South for roughly $238 million, making it the most expensive home ever sold in the US. That record remains to this day.\nLead listing brokerNikki Fieldof Sotheby\u2019s International Realty told Bloomberg that the Steinway Tower quadplex was originally two duplexes, but the decision was made to up the ante by combining them.\nPreviously, nearby Central Park Tower was home to the city\u2019s most expensive residences. One, a penthouse thatlisted for a breathtaking $250 millionin 2022, laterhad its price reducedto $195 million. The other, called \u201cSky House,\u201dasked $150 millionwhen it listed in 2024.\nToday, neither of them remain for sale, we hear. The former, according to StreetEasy, left the market in October 2024. The latter, the listings portal also shows, was taken off the market in March. (Extell, the developer behind Central Park Tower, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)\nSteinway Tower \u2014 developed by JDS Development Group, Property Markets Group and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance \u2014 has seen a spate of contract signings in recent months. Nikki Field\u2019s team at Sotheby\u2019s, which took over sales at the tower in the summer of 2024, takes the credit.\nIn the eight months since Field took over, the building has been rebranded, repriced and restaffed.\nField\u2019s efforts seem fruitful.The firm reported $187 million in deals currently under contract, with eight contracts so far this year. That includes Penthouse 72, which last listed for $56 million. Steinway Tower has 59 units.\nField, who helped sell Jeff Bezoshis penthouse at 212 Fifth Avenue, told The Post that she is looking for a similarly exceptional buyer for Penthouse 80.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Jeff Bezos 2.0 at 111,\u201d Field said.\nThis is all welcome news for the skyscraper, which opened its doors in 2022 aftera fraught construction process. Initial sales were sluggish and prices were reduced, even into last year.\nField told Bloomberg that Penthouse 80 was held back until sales proved strong enough to support the listing. It appears that the time was finally right \u2014 market reports and in-the-know brokers confirm that ultra-luxury sales in Manhattan are booming this year while supply remains low.\n\u201cThis very healthy luxury spring market,\u201d Field said. \u201cWe had no excuses to delay the launch.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A meticulously restored Georgian townhouse at 241 E. 48th St. has come up for sale \u2014 and beyond its many perks, it comes with coveted access to a rare oasis in Manhattan.\nPriced at $11.5 million, this 5,500-square-foot residence sits within the exclusive Turtle Bay Gardens, a historic enclave known for its lush, private communal garden \u2014 a lush hangout accessible only to the 20 surrounding homes.\nThe property, a five-story masterpiece with a finished cellar, boasts a recent Landmarks-approved renovation and modern luxuries like a smart home system and elevator access, all while preserving its turn-of-the-century charm.\nTurtle Bay Gardens, nestled between East 48th and 49th streets between Second and Third avenues, has long been a magnet for luminaries.\nIn 1920, Charlotte Hunnewell Sorchan transformed the area by acquiring adjacent lots and reimagining them as a cohesive community.\nShe enlisted architects to strip away the original facades, replacing them with elegant stucco, and cultivated a central garden filled with towering trees and pleasing shrubs. Today, the enclave remains a coveted retreat.\nThe townhouse itself is a standout. Its ground floor features a chef\u2019s kitchen with a waterfall island, a sun-drenched great room with 20-foot ceilings and a gas fireplace.\nThe parlor level offers a formal living room with a Juliet balcony and a built-in library, while the upper floors house a full-floor primary suite with a spa-like bathroom, two ensuite bedrooms, and a loft-style suite with a terrace overlooking the large garden.\nA cellar entertainment room, a gym and ample storage round out the offerings.\n\u201cOffered well below replacement value \u2014 estimated to save the new owner over $2 million in renovation costs \u2014 this is a true turnkey masterpiece,\u201d the listing says. The property is represented by Nikki Field and Matt Perceval, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nTurtle Bay Gardens has historically drawn a roster of cultural icons, includingKatharine Hepburn,Stephen Sondheim, and E.B. White, who penned \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d while residing on 48th Street.\nBut perhaps the garden enclave\u2019s most famous resident was Bob Dylan, who lived next door at 242 E. 49th St. for two decades, from the 1980s to 2005. That property, which is also one of the few that enjoys garden access,listed for $7.25 millionin December 2024. It entered into contract in February.\nDylan\u2019s tenure inTurtle Bay Gardensbegan when he rented the townhouse in the 1980s, later purchasing it in 1990 through a business associate.\nHe raised his young children there, drawn to the privacy the enclave afforded.\nHe eventually sold the home in 2005 for $4.45 million, and its recent listing coincided \u2014 purely by chance, the agent insists \u2014 with the theatrical release of the buzzy 2024 film about his life.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s creative legacy extends beyond Dylan. Hepburn lived at 244 E. 49th St., while Sondheim called the same address home for 60 years until his death in 2021; his property fetched $7 million in 2023.\nEven more recently, banker Olivier Sarkozy and child star Mary-Kate Olsenowned a double-wide townhouseat 226-228 E. 49th St., selling it for just over $10 million in 2024 after their divorce.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "With the promise of state grant funding and historic tax credits, developers are pitching their plans for a 68-room hotel with a retail space or restaurant on the ground floor",
        "content": "First they planned a hotel. Then condos. Then a hotel again.After nearly seven years and three failed redevelopment attempts, the owners of the long-empty Alexandra Hotel on the border of the South End and Roxbury are back with another proposal to revive the historic property.With the promise of state grant funding and historic tax credits \u2014 along interest from as-yet unnamed investors \u2014 developer Tom Calus said he and business partner Jas Bhogal expect this fourth proposal to be \u201cthe one.\u201d\u201cThis is one of the most beautiful buildings in Boston, arguably, and it really deserves to be restored, brought back to its original grandeur,\u201d Calus said.The building's historic facade. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe Victorian Gothic property, which dates to 1875, has seen a long stretch of unsuccessful redevelopment plays. In 2008, the Church of Scientology bought the dilapidated building for $4.5 million, planning a restoration that was to eventually house the church\u2019s local headquarters. That project proved expensive, and ultimately the Scientologists put the property back on the market for sale in late 2014. It spent nearly five years on the market, and at least one sale agreement fell through before Calus and Bhogal spent $11 million to buy the site in 2019.By that time, Calus and Bhogal had already been involved in the Alexandra Hotel for a year. In mid-2018, they pitched a facade restoration in front of a 150-room hotel; the Boston Planning and Development Agency later approved a 12-story project with a rooftop restaurant and deck.Advertisement\u201cDue to decades of neglect and extensive water infiltration, the existing structure is no longer viable and will accordingly be replaced,\u201d the BPDA said when approving the first redevelopment attempt.AdvertisementBut then came the COVID-19 pandemic, which clobbered the hospitality and tourism industry, and there wasn\u2019t much appetite for a new hotel. So Calus and Bhogal in mid-2021 came back to the city with a new plan: condominiums. A few months later, the BPDA approved 79 condos, including some compact units.Shortly after the approval, federal interest rates \u2014 which had long been near zero \u2014 began shooting up. Construction financing, which had been readily available for years, quickly became much more expensive and made projects harder to pencil out economically.Bhogal and Calus considered switching to apartments, but the hotel market had begun showing new signs of life. The pair reverted to their original plan: a hotel built behind a restored facade, a 13-story, 150-room structure with rooftop bar and restaurant. The BPDA board approved that $70 million project last May.\u201cConstruction costs were through the roof, and we weren\u2019t able to make the project work as a larger hotel,\u201d Calus said. \u201cSo we decided to rethink the project.\u201dA rendering of the ground floor, which would include either a retail store or a restaurant.EmbarcAmid the rethinking came a big stroke of good fortune: Governor Maura Healey\u2019s $3.5 billion economic development bill \u2014 signed into law in November \u2014 set aside some $6 million for the Alexandra\u2019s facade restoration. By reducing the project\u2019s size, the expected cost similarly declined. And if the developers kept the Alexandra standing, rather than tearing most of it down, the project could qualify for historic tax credits.The developers this week filed a fourth, and what they hope is final, redevelopment plan with the city that calls for restoring the historic Alexandra and building a five-story expansion on the vacant lot next door. The 68-room hotel would include retail or restaurant on the ground floor.AdvertisementA view of the empty lot next to former Alexandra Hotel where the addition is planned.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAn added bonus? Removing the \u201ccontroversial\u201d tower above the existing facade \u2014 long the subject of neighborhood ire \u2014 has renewed community excitement about a restoration, Calus said.\u201cMost people in the community, and Boston as a whole, really want to see this building restored the way it is, without having to add a tower,\u201d Calus said. \u201cWe like the scale of it. We like the design of the new building and how it connects with the old building. We\u2019re just happy to move this project along.\u201dThe project team has donated to community benefits, as many developers in Boston do. And an advisory meeting at the Boston Landmarks Commission saw an \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d response and a few minor design tweaks, said Marc LaCasse, an attorney representing the developers.\u201cThe big bone of contention in all the prior approvals was the height of the tower,\u201d LaCasse said. \u201cThe fact that the tower is gone \u2014 everyone says, \u2018We love it. ... When can you start?\u2018\u201dBob Minnocci, a board member of the Worcester Square Area Neighborhood Association, said several community members who had previously opposed the project due to the additional height were now fully in support. Minnocci, who himself lives a few doors down from the Alexandra, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d at the potential of something actually happening on the dilapidated property.\u201cIt\u2019s just been falling into greater disrepair as the years have gone on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a blight on the community \u2014 your eye just can\u2019t go further when you look at that blight. Now you\u2019re going to see a fresh, brand new project that\u2019s just going to be beautiful, cleaned up, and really be an important part of the gateway from this area.\u201dAdvertisementAt its smaller size, the project can move more quickly through the Planning Department\u2019s review. LaCasse said he expected the BPDA board to vote on the proposal as soon as next month, and then South End Landmarks Commission needs to give its final sign-off before work can begin.\u201cOur heart is attached to it at this point, so we want to take it through,\u201d Calus said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say there haven\u2019t been moments where we lost hope and faith. This new iteration feels right, and we\u2019re very happy with it, and we\u2019re excited for this, so it\u2019s kind of giving us some new energy. We\u2019re not giving up. This one\u2019s going to work. This one\u2019s the one.\u201dFaded architectural details of the building's exterior.David L.

        "subhead": "Plus, what to do when a woodpecker is making holes in your home.",
        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nAs a follow-up to my December 2024 column \u201cSmart planning for your 2025 home renovation,\u201c I wanted to expand on a concern that is becoming more and more common: How to accommodate the increasing need for electricity in our homes.\n\nWe are getting more calls from homeowners for heat pumps, car chargers, and HRV or ERV systems for in-home air quality as a result of tightening up insulation. To resolve many of these circumstances, we are increasing the electrical service capacity, which is typically the preferred approach. However, for any number of reasons, this is not always practical.\n\nAnother option for homeowners that I\u2019d like to explore is to install a load manager adjacent to your circuit panel.\n\nThese load managers can be set to shut down pre-determined nonessential circuits when the load on the panel reaches a certain level, typically 80 percent. At that point, circuits for items like washers and dryers, spas or pools, garage lighting, and door openers would be shut down. This would allow essentials like refrigerators, HVAC equipment, and other needs to be kept live without overloading the system.\n\nThe circuits chosen to be kept live or shut down can be customized for individual needs and are completely up to the owner. Most load managers can be controlled and monitored with your phone using an app, so they can also be changed at any time. They also are useful in tracking electrical usage in far greater detail, something that can be helpful as people try to conserve energy and save money.\n\nHome load managers can be integrated into any home electrical system, whether you have solar installed, battery backups, or generators. As always, it is advised to have a qualified electrician come in to evaluate your electrical service and balance that with your current needs and/or future requirements as you modernize your home.\n\nUltimately, this will be helpful for both your home budget and for the planet.\n\n\nQ.We have an 1880s Queen Anne cottage that has cedar clapboard on the first floor and cedar shakes on the second. We have no idea why a woodpecker would be drilling holes in our second-floor shakes, primarily on our turret. Periodically, we have contractors come out and fill the holes with putty and re-stain. They didn\u2019t see insects. What is going on, and what can we do to prevent this?\n\nJB\n\nA.This is more common that you might think: We have had other readers ask about this, and I\u2019ve worked with a client who had a woodpecker problem, too. Woodpeckers typically peck out holes in trees (or houses) for one of three reasons. They are after food or trying to store food; they may be trying to build a nest; or a male is trying to court a female. A male trying to find a mate will even peck into something just to make a racket and attract her attention. It could even be a metal chimney cap or roof vent, it doesn\u2019t always have to be wood. It is hard to say which of the three your particular woodpecker is doing.\n\nWhen we had the issue with a past client, the best recommendation we had was to hang reflective streamers in the windows near where the birds were wreaking havoc. It seemed to work. Looking at the photo you sent, streamers inside the second-story windows between the storm and the actual window may do the trick. If practical, an even better place for the reflective streamers would be outside, where the actual damage is occurring. Another source for info and/or solutions would be your localAudubon Society, where you will find bird experts who may have better insights. If possible, get a picture of the bird and the holes they are making. Good luck!\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

Standing in the foyer, there is a pair of double-doored closets on the right, one for the washer and dryer. The flooring here is hardwood.\n\n\nMoving directly ahead, first to arrive is the kitchen, which is snuggled into its own area through a doorway on the left.

The dining area is nicely placed in front of the tall windows and the view of the Seaport.\n\n\nReturning to the foyer and turning to the right, the hallway leads to the first of two bedrooms. For the secondary bedroom, the flooring changes to carpeting in the short hallway that hosts a closet on the left and a bathroom on the right. The full bath has tan stone tile flooring, a single vanity top, and a shower behind a clear glass door with a tile backsplash.\n\n\nThe secondary bedroom is 163 square feet and is sun-splashed from the floor-to-ceiling windows with six panes and thick metal framing.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The stock marketmay be down, but Manhattan\u2019s ultra-luxury residential market is looking better than it has since the pandemic.\nThat\u2019s the verdict according to market reports by New York City brokerages,compiled and reported by CNBC. Manhattan\u2019s ultra-high-end luxury real estate market \u2014 with properties priced north of $20 million \u2014 had its best first quarter in six years, according to a cited Compass report. Those with very deep pockets tend to buy units in all-cash deals; 58% of sales in the quarter were made in cash, with units priced above $3 million seeing 90% of sales from buyers coming in with cash.\nThose in-the-know on Manhattan\u2019s luxury market, like Keller Williams agent Nicole Gary, say that the uptick is impossible to ignore. After a quiet 2024, demand among ultra-high-net-worth clients is up.\n\u201cThings that have been sitting for a long time started to move,\u201d Gary, who leads the the Nicole Gary team at Keller Williams NYC, told The Post.\nGary said limited high-end inventory and clients\u2019 desire to move money from financial markets into real estate play heavily into the recent wave.\n\u201cPeople always feel that Manhattan real estate is a safe bet. It\u2019s a hedge against inflation, and it\u2019s a place where people feel safe when you know the stock market is volatile,\u201d Gary said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing over the past few months, is a little bit of volatility with the tariffs and everything that\u2019s going on politically. People are taking the opportunity to purchase these trophy units in Manhattan.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s overall market is showing early strength, as well. Closed Manhattan sales in the first quarter of 2025 exceeded last year\u2019s quarter one sales by nearly 29%, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. There were 2,560 closed sales in the quarter, up from 1,988 the year prior. The total value of apartment sales reached $5.7 billion, 56% over the same quarter in 2024.\nThat said, that\u2019s all been driven by the higher end of the market. Compass data shows that sales priced above $5 million jumped by 49% year-over-year.\nIt\u2019s a buyers market, even along Billionaires\u2019 Row, and the ultra-high-net-worth are taking the opportunity to upgrade.\nIncreasingly strict back-to-office mandates on Wall Street and beyond are also bringing high earners back into the Manhattan fold. CNBC\u2019s report also cited the \u201cgreat wealth transfer,\u201d the ongoing intergenerational transfer of trillions of dollars from the baby boomer generation to their fortunate offspring, as moving the real estate needle.\nBut the bullish numbers don\u2019t reflect the whole picture. Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, told CNBC that the first quarter of 2024 was atypically slow.\u00a0Instead, Miller is framing 2025 as \u201cthe year of getting back to normal,\u201d according to his report.\nWhat is clear, however, is that the luxury market is \u201ccarrying the team,\u201d this year. CNBC reported that mid-market sales \u2014 sales between $1 million and $3 million, have lagged.\n\u201cI think buyers in that range worry more than the ultra-high-net-worth clients,\u201d Gary told The Post. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling with \u2018Where\u2019s the economy going? Is this a good time to invest?\u2019\u201d\nBuyers interested in $10 million-plus or $20 million-plus condos typically own multiple homes, and they\u2019re often paying in cash, Gary said, so they are less risk-averse than your average hopeful homeowner.\nCompass\u2019s 2024 year-end report on the ultra-luxury market predicted an increasingly competitive market through 2025, particularly as the reality of low ultra-luxe inventory meets with a rising trend of ultra-exclusive private listings.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Homebuilders are responding to\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s new\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, and say that although the worst-case scenario was avoided, the new trade policy will inevitably raise the\u00a0cost to build homes.\nTrump on Wednesday announcedsweeping new tariffson most major trading partners,stunning Wall Streetand sending thestock market into a nosedive.\nCollectively, Trump\u2019s trade moves bring the effective tariff rate on all imports to around 26%, up from 2.3% before he took office, according to an assessment from Capital Economics.\n\u201cWhile the complexity of these reciprocal tariffs makes it hard to estimate the overall impact on housing, they will undoubtedly raise some construction costs,\u201d says\u00a0Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.\nA recentsurvey of homebuildersfound that they expect an average cost increase of $9,200 per home due to the recent tariffs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods that must be paid by the company receiving the imports.\nIf their construction costs rise, homebuilders could either try to pass the increase along to buyers or reduce their profit margins. Builder margins are\u00a0already under pressure, and if they are squeezed too much, construction activity could decline.\nNationally, the\u00a0median sales price for new single-family homes\u00a0was $414,500 in March, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\nWhile the new tariffs willincrease\u00a0construction costs for homebuilders, the majority of the U.S. housing market is made up of previously owned homes.\nIn March, about 18% of the homes listed for sale across the country were newly built, according to\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0data.\nHowever, new construction plays an outsized role in certain states\u2014and those are often places where housing is scarce and the need for additional housing is the strongest.\nIn Idaho, a whopping 40% of active listings on the market last month were new builds, the highest share of any state.\nBehind Idaho were North Carolina (33% new construction), Delaware (31%), Utah (28%), and Nebraska (28%).\n\u201cThe states at the top of this list are the ones doing the most to address the housing supply gap, but they are also the most at risk of being affected by tariffs,\u201d says Realtor.com senior economist\u00a0Joel Berner.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cThe cost associated with tariffs on building materials gets passed along to new-home buyers, which works against the progress builders have made in these states to grow housing inventory and make homeownership more attainable,\u201d he adds.\nImportantly, Trump\u2019s latest announcement contained a key exception that will limit the fallout for homebuilders, by continuing to exempt Canadian lumber from any new tariffs.\nThe NAHB estimates that 72% of imported lumber comes from Canada, making it a vital source of the key building material. Canadian lumber continues to face tariffs of 14.5%, which predate Trump\u2019s second term. So far, he has exempted lumber from any additional new duties.\nIn a statement, Hughes said the homebuilder trade group \u201cis pleased President Trump recognized the importance of critical construction inputs for housing\u201d by continuing to exempt lumber from any new tariffs.\nStill, the new tariffs could affect many imported construction inputs, ranging from appliances and fixtures made in Asia to flooring and countertops from South America.\nProduction that already shifted out of China in response to tariffs on that country during Trump\u2019s first term could now be subject to harsh new levies.\nFor example, industry experts say kitchen sink production has moved largely from China to Malaysia and Indonesia, countries whose exports to the U.S. will now be taxed at 24% and 32%, respectively. And goods still imported from China now face eye-watering tariffs of 54%.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s tariff announcement was a real whirlwind that has left the stock market reeling, but one of the few bright spots was that Canada and Mexico were largely left alone,\u201d says Berner.\n\u201cLumber from Canada and gypsum from Mexico are important inputs to American homebuilding, and while it would not be a surprise to see the White House target these imports again in the near future, the immediate threat of the tariff announcement on American builders appears to be less severe than it could have been,\u201d he adds.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire Meta titan, has been outed as the buyer of a $23 million residence in Washington, DC \u2014 a purchase that underscores a growing trend among tech execs securing a foothold in the nation\u2019s capital during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\nThe expansive property, located less than 15 minutes from the White House depending on traffic, also places Zuckerberg in walking distance toVice President JD Vance\u2019sofficial residence at the Naval Observatory.\nThe transaction, executed in March through a Delaware-based limited liability company in all cash, ranks as the third-most expensive home sale in the city\u2019s history, according toPolitico.\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the acquisition, stating to The Post: \u201cMark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.\u201d\nThe 15,400-square-foot brick mansion, designed by prominent local architect Robert M. Gurney, replaced a $5.15 million property demolished in 2013.\nThe new residence boasts five bedrooms and 7.5 baths, and features two kitchens and three fireplaces, according to development records obtained by The Post.\nExtensive outdoor amenities include a basketball court and a pool complex, fortified by newly constructed walls and fencing for enhanced security.\nNestled on a nearly 1-acre corner lot in the leafy Massachusetts Avenue Heights neighborhood of Northwest DC, the residence sits amid notable landmarks like the mighty Washington Cathedral and beautiful Embassy Row.\nThe residence aligns with the street\u2019s traditional aesthetic by hugging the road, freeing up ample private outdoor space and greenery at the back.\nThe dwelling comprises three distinct sections linked by glass-enclosed walkways, blending modern flair with classic gabled roofs, tall chimneys and steel windows.\nInside, these sections cater to both expansive communal areas and cozy family retreats.\nThe handsome exterior features durable brick and limestone walls, slate roofing, powder-coated steel windows and copper downspouts, selected to harmonize with the neighborhood while withstanding the elements.\nZuckerberg\u2019s move coincides with a wave of high-profile tech figures establishing a presence in Washington as the industry seeks to influence Trump\u2019s administration.\u00a0Others, meanwhile, have already been there for some time.\nDavid Sacks, Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency adviser, acquired a $10.3 million home in January, while Amazon founderJeff Bezospurchased a $23 million property in 2016. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel bought a $13 million residence in 2021, and former Google executive Eric Schmidt secured a $15 million mansion in 2024, previously a temporary home for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\nIn contrast, Elon Musk, a key presidential adviser, has eschewed a permanent DC address, opting to sleep in his office at the Executive Office Building and frequently accompanying Trump to Mar-a-Lago in Florida.\nThe timing of Zuckerberg\u2019s purchase raises eyebrows. He was seen at the White House on Wednesday, the same day reports surfaced of Musk\u2019s planned exit from government duties by late May, fueling speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s potential role as a tech confidant to Trump.\nYet, immediate challenges loom for the Meta chief. The company faces an antitrust trial in April, with the Federal Trade Commission weighing a breakup of its WhatsApp and Instagram holdings. A settlement with the administration could mitigate risks, though Trump may see political value in targeting a tech giant.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The tony Southampton estate at 623 Halsey Neck Lane, the cherished retreat of the late Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun and his wife, Mica, has slashed its asking price by nearly 35% \u2014 tumbling from $52 million to $34 million, The Post has learned.\nThe 11,000-square-foot Hamptons property, perched on 5.5 acres with 450 feet of Taylor Creek frontage, listed for that higher sum in March 2024 \u2014 its first availability since the Erteguns built it 35 years ago.\nAhmet, a music industry titan who propelled talents like Ray Charles and the Rolling Stones to stardom, died in 2006 at 83 after a backstage fall in Manhattan. Socialite and philanthropist Mica, who outlived him by almost 17 years, passed away at 97 in December 2023 at this East End property, one of four the couple owned around the world.\nThe residence features 10 bedrooms, 13.5 bathrooms, a staff wing and striking design elements like a towering pyramid-vaulted living room ceiling and a Palladian-inspired layout.\nAnd now, a deep-pocketed house hunter can buy it for less.\n\u201cThe price change really sort of came about as a result of having the house on the market for some period of time and realizing the buyer pool expectations given that the house, though is certainly in wonderful condition, is a house that was built 30 years ago,\u201d Tim Davis of Corcoran, one of the brokers representing the listing, told The Post.\n\u201cPeople may want to make changes to it and make some improvements to it. And we\u2019re seeing some very, very strong prices with houses that really don\u2019t require any work at all,\u201d Davis added. \u201cAnd those that do require some work, we are seeing that we\u2019re adjusting to the marketplace and getting a lot more action and offers.\u201d\nDavis said that since the price cut, the home has lured in several interested parties, including an individual who plans on bringing his architect to see what modern-day upgrades can be made.\n\u201cIf somebody was to buy this and spend $4 to $5 million renovating, that\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d Davis added. \u201cSomebody could probably still be in for July and August of this year, if they got into it right away, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on right now.\u201d\nFacing a conservation parcel once tied to the DuPont family \u2014 industrialists famed for their gunpowder fortune \u2014 the estate carries a whiff of Southampton\u2019s storied past.\n\u201cThese are sort of old-world, old-money names that were part of the history of Southampton in general. So to that, it has its own interest and the home itself is quite impressive,\u201d Davis previously told The Post.\nBeyond its grandeur, the couple\u2019s worldly d\u00e9cor kept inside this residence, and all their others,was the focusof a buzzy Christie\u2019s auction in late 2024. The sale comprised 636 lots from the Erteguns\u2019 collection \u2014 artworks, antique furniture and china \u2014 with about 230 lots originating from this East End dwelling.\nThe auction, according to the Christie\u2019s website, brought in a whopping $191.61 million in sales total across three November sales in New York and Paris. (It isn\u2019t clear if that figure includes fees.)\nSome of the prized pieces included the John Helion \u201cBande Verte\u201d painting from 1936, which was auctioned off for over $1 million \u2014 $300,000 more than it was initially expected to go for.\nA David Hockney painting from 1937, which portrayed three chairs with a section of a Picasso mural, went for $9.03 million \u2014 $3 million more than it was expected to fetch.\nBut the priciest in the auction, was a Rene Magritte painting from 1954, titled\u00a0\u201cL\u2019empire des lumi\u00e8res,\u201d which was auctioned off for a colossal $121.16 million \u2014 and set a new record as the most expensive surrealist artwork ever sold.\nThe mansion now sits vacant, its contents stripped away following the auction.\u00a0Proceeds from the auction and the home sale are both slated to go to charity.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been the only owners. I was sort of dreading this house being empty of furniture,\u201d Davis previously said. \u201cIn a way now, one can view the space and be part of that space and imagine themselves being there in their own way \u2014 without feeling like they need to honor what was once there.\u201d\nThe estate is co-listed with Harald Grant of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nAdvertisement",

Most recently, a businessman based in Australia, Ken He, had acquired it in 2014 with the intentions of building housing there. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, disrupting his plans. A lawyer for He, John G.F. Ruggieri, called the proposed sale to Mass Audubon an improper taking at a liquidation price; his client filed an appeal the next day. (In a statement, Mass Audubon says the owner had neglected the property and had plenty of time to line up a buyer.)Chelsea city officials had begun the process of seeking a court-appointed receiver to take control of the run-down property when a massive fire hit in November, disrupting travel on the commuter rail tracks that run along the site. The receiver then took over, with the help of a $400,000 loan from the city to cover her expenses. She petitioned Nestor to approve the sale, citing the site\u2019s deteriorating conditions.AdvertisementOn March 25, Nestor agreed to the deal.\u201cWhat is needed in this matter is a certain and soon outcome,\u201d Nestor wrote. \u201cThis offer will repay the taxpayers of Chelsea, clean up the property, and provide a reasonable development for the site. Defendants have had ample opportunity to suggest a viable opportunity but have failed to do so.\u201dFor Mass Audubon, the site would fit in well with its newer mission of developing green spaces in urban areas. Mass Audubon, GreenRoots, and their supporters have already raised the money for the purchase price, though president David O\u2019Neill said they would need to raise another $30 million to clean up the property and build a waterfront park and nature center. A portion of those funds would come from The Neighborhood Developers, a Chelsea-based affordable housing nonprofit that would buy a five-acre section of the property and build up to 225 units there. TND executive director Rafael Mares called it \u201ca transformative project\u201d that\u2019s \u201cworth the wait.\u201dHousing and land conservation, O\u2019Neill said, are often portrayed as conflicting uses.\u201cIn this instance, what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2018\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThis is an example of what can be done [with housing and conservation groups] working together.\u201dBut first the Mass Audubon team will need to get through He, who bought the property in 2014 for $11.6 million and remains its owner.Ruggieri, his lawyer, called the sale a \u201ccompletely ramrodded, behind-the-scenes deal.\u201d His client, he said, has poured millions into the property, mainly for permitting, since acquiring it and was fielding interest from potential buyers when the receiver took control and fired his broker. The offers, Ruggieri said, were for well above what Mass Audubon has agreed to pay.Advertisement\u201cThe owner of this property is absolutely apoplectic about this order,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cWe are very confident that the Appeals Court will not sanction [this] distressed sale. ... We\u2019re not enemies of the Audubon Society. However, they need to pay the proper price. They just can\u2019t take it clandestinely.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

        "subhead": "\u201cThe biggest misconception is that floods only happen in coastal areas \u2014 that it\u2019s only an issue for the Cape and the islands,\u201d one expert said.",
        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nDo you have flood insurance? If your home is located in a high-flood-risk area and you have a federally backed mortgage, you probably do because your lender would have required it. But what if you paid cash for your home? Or it\u2019s not located in a high-flood-risk area? You might still need flood insurance to protect what, for many, is their largest asset \u2014 your home.\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), more than 40% of claims through theNational Flood Insurance Program(NFIP) come from damage to homes located outside high-risk areas. In fact, not only is coverage available for less risky locations, but properties located in low-to-moderate risk areas may even qualify for a lower-cost Preferred Risk Policy, which provides protection at a more affordable cost.\nAccording to LendingTree, despite the fact that flooding is the most common and expensive natural disaster in the United States \u2014\u00a0with\u00a0an average payment per flood-insurance claim of $33,905 in 2024 through Nov. 30 \u2014\u00a0flood insurance enrollment fell between November 2023 and November 2024. Experts say that\u2019s because there are many myths about flood insurance.\n\u201cThe biggest misconception is that floods only happen in coastal areas \u2014 that it\u2019s only an issue for the Cape and the islands,\u201d saidBen Cavallo, a principal ofC&S Insurancein Mansfield. \u201cButLeominster had 11 inches of rain in one dayin 2023, and there was massive flooding even though it\u2019s nowhere near the water. You can be vulnerable to a flood even on a hill.\u201d\nThe City of Boston recognizes the risk of flooding with adedicated section on its websiteabout the risks. \u201cFlood is one of the most common and costly natural disasters,\u201d said Logan Grant, Boston\u2019s floodplain administrator. \u201cHowever, many homeowners and renters underestimate their risk.\u201d\nAnother common myth is that a homeowners policy will cover flood damage. Not so, Grant said \u2014 a separate flood insurance policy is recommended for those at risk.\nCheck with your insurance agent to find out whether it\u2019s advisable for you to have flood insurance and where to get it. Policies are available through the NFIP or through private companies, some of which are now adding flood coverage to an existing homeowners policy, Cavallo said, although that\u2019s primarily for companies that insure high-net-worth homeowners. You can also find a flood insurance provider atfloodsmart.gov/get-insured/flood-insurance-provider.\nAlthough you can select how much coverage you want,the NFIP limits building coverageto $250,000 and contents coverage to $100,000 for a one- to four-family structure. Excess flood insurance, with higher limits, is available from private companies.\nAccording to Cavallo, an NFIP policy on a hypothetical single-family home in a moderate-to-low flood-risk area of Bedford, with a limit of $250,000 for the dwelling and $100,000 for contents, would cost $434 per year. Compare that to the premium for an NFIP policy in the same amounts for a seasonal single-family home on the beach on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a special flood hazard area, which would cost $11,119 per year.\nCavallo recommends shopping around for the right flood product and price. Those concerned about the premiums they\u2019re quoted may want to raise the policy deductible and accept more risk themselves, which would lower the premium.\n\u201cYou\u2019re better off having a high deductible and some coverage than no coverage at all,\u201d he said.\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

The clip attracted over a million views, and the attention of the family who actually live there.\nThe \u201cGirvan Tower\u201d on Girvan Estate is believed to be the tallest private residence in the country and was built for the late Peter Grey over six years in the 1990s.\nAndrea and Andrew Evans bought the estate for $779,204 USD in 2012, which was reportedly significantly less than the house cost to build.\nThe family now run Vast Harvest Permaculture \u2013 a completely self-sustainable food forest and orchard \u2013 across 400 acres.\nJames Evans, 21, told news.com.au they had been reluctant to show off the 10-story house on their own social media because they wanted to keep the focus on permaculture, but when a stranger\u2019s video went viral, they changed their mind.\n\u201cEveryone was saying it\u2019s a hotel and this and that, so [I thought] I may as well clarify the facts,\u201d James said.\nAnother reason the Evans\u2019 were hesitant to do a full house tour before now was to avoid people making the assumption that a 10-story house meant the family was sitting back and living a life of luxury.\n\u201cWe\u2019re nothing fancy. I drive an old HiLux and even if I had the money to buy a Lamborghini I wouldn\u2019t, I would spend it on something that\u2019s beneficial for the community and all of us because that is what we believe in,\u201d James said.\nThe ground floor has the original red carpet, chandelier and pool, while the first floor, which is also treated as a \u201cstorage level,\u201d has some gym equipment and what was an outdoor tennis court.\nThe third floor is James\u2019 living area and bedroom, and the fourth floor is his younger brother Drew and his fiancee\u2019s space. Both James and Drew are renovating their own levels.\nThe fifth floor is where the family\u2019s kitchen is located, the sixth floor has the lounge room, as well as food storage, and the seventh floor is the parents\u2019 room. Level eight is the office and level nine (or the tenth story) is the rooftop with an \u201cobservation deck\u201d.\nThere are incredible views of surrounding farmland, all the way to Newcastle and the ocean on the horizon.\nWhile the 10-story building is not apartments like many assume, the second floor has been recently renovated with the intention of being listed as a short term holiday rental on Airbnb \u201cvery soon\u201d.\nThe Vast Harvest Permaculture business is not new to tourism. The family offer paid tours to visitors, including guided walks and tastings through the \u201cfood forest\u201d and a farm-to-table meal. They also run workshops that include building birdhouses, cultivating mushrooms, and learning the permaculture technique of building swales on contour.\nBut they are ready to expand their offering by opening up a floor in their house to guests, building two additional tiny houses for accommodation, and starting buggy and horseback rides \u2013 with the goal of reaching more people to educate on self-sufficient living and healthy eating.\nJames said the best part about the unusual house was getting their own space, given the family work and live together.\n\u201cMy dad is 60 and he works his butt off. I try and get him to go on holidays and he refuses to. He is like me, a homebody,\u201d James said.\n\u201cI think I left this 20-minute area once in the last four months and that was yesterday.\u201d\nJames says it\u2019s not the 10-story house but their 24 mile food forest that deserves the hype. It has jack fruit, the largest tree fruit, and 15 different varieties of mangoes.\n\u201cInstead of it [the forest] producing inedible plants, it\u2019s all edible plants. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t need human hands. It\u2019s basically the Garden of Eden or Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory because everything is edible that you see around you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSome things obviously do need to be cooked like elderberries and things like that but it is designed to be a living garden that looks after itself.\n\u201cWe let the bottom third of the fruit on the tree drop, we take the middle third, and the top third goes to the animals and the birds.\u201d\nThose animals are pigs, chickens and ducks. The family also mill their own timber on the property.\nJames plans to one day take over the farm and business, and never leave.\n\u201cI don\u2019t just want my kids here and my brother\u2019s kids here, I want my grandkids and great grandkids, all the kids here and build a future generation of sustainability,\u201d he said.\nThe full house tour is available on Vast Harvest Permaculture\u2019s YouTube channel.\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s according to a recent report by the apartment search website RentCafe, which measured early-2025 rental market competitiveness in 139 US markets, including Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\n\u201cFolks are staying longer in their apartments,\u201d said Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi Matrix, which provides data to RentCafe. \u201cInterest rates and the lack of supply of affordable housing is forcing that issue.\u201d\nAverage stays range from 38 months, or just over three years, in Manhattan, all the way up to an impressive 51 months, or 4.25 years, in Queens.\nThe average renter in Brooklyn is staying 42 months, or 3.5 years, according to the report.\nThe data from which the findings were pulled encompasses January, February and March, but prime renting season is just heating up. Renters can expect a more frantic environment in thecutthroat environment of late summer, when a majority of renters renew their leases or find a new apartment.\nThe data gives clearer insight into one of the many reasons that the Big Apple\u2019s rental market remains challenging. Increased bidding warshave been documentedin pockets across the city.\nWith demand high and supply low, compounded by an increasingly uncertain economy, New Yorkers are feeling anything but restless.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a housing gap, and it\u2019s taken over a decade to create that gap,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be solved in the near term. So people are going to be renting longer.\u201d\nFirst-time homebuyers areolder than ever before, according to the National Association of Realtors. More would-be homeowners, who might otherwise make room for more renters by trading in a lease for a deed, are sticking to renting in the face of high mortgage rates and unaffordable home prices.\nRegardless of supply changes or demand shifts, this is still New York City. When a renter finds The One, they don\u2019t let it go. And besides, New Yorkers tend to get attached to their block, Ressler said.\n\u201cCommunity evolves around these housing cohorts, especially in urban cores. It really becomes quite prominent,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cThey [renters] want to be able to go get the pizza where they always go.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

At the time, the 2006 deal for the Upper East Side\u2019s Harkness House \u2014 a $53 million transaction \u2014 still held the crown.\nUltimately, Rubenstein saw the residence bounce on and off the market until 2022, whenit entered contractfor \u201cnearly\u201d $50 million, according to reports at the time. City records now show the limestone property traded hands for $48 million that September \u2014 with the buyer, now its seller, listed as an anonymous LLC.\nIn the years following Rubenstein\u2019s $84.5 million listing, an Upper East Side townhouse at 14-16 E. 67th St. traded hands in 2019 for $77.1 million, according to Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel.

What\u2019s more, there\u2019s also a formal dining room whose view corridor extends to the Pierre Hotel, according to the listing.\nMost notably, a relic from Rubenstein\u2019s residency remains: a billiards room that\u2019s lined with Herm\u00e8s-leather walls.\nIt\u2019s all capped by a roof terrace, accessible via an elevator, with views of Central Park, as well as a lounge and dining area below a cedar pergola. The lower level, meanwhile, has a wine cellar, a skylighted gym, a new sauna and a steam room.

        "content": "This hollowed-out shell of a landmarked Manhattan theater just got its big break.\nThe long-shuttered Metro Theater finally sold on Friday to the nonprofit Upper West Side Cinema Center, thanks to a big boost from the governor and a star-studded list of supporters. The New York Times firstreported on the successful sale.\nUpper West Side Cinema Center formed in 2024, spearheaded by Ira Deutchman and Adeline Monzier, and in November signed an ambitious agreementto buy the 10,260-square-foot buildingfor $6.9 million in cash by Jan. 10, 2025.\nThe endeavor enjoyed initial fundraising upwards of $2.5 million anda gaggle of famous friends, including Martin Scorsese, Ethan Hawke and Tim Blake Nelson, the latter of whom serves on its board of directors.\nDespite hundreds of donations ahead of the January deadline, the $6.9 million needed was out of reach. Then, the governor stepped in.\nWith encouragement from Assemblyman Micha Lasher, Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a $3.5 million grant. That boost, paired with $500,000 from the State Senate, earned the nonprofit a deadline extension.\nThe government support, buoyed by 400-some individual donations and a hefty grant from Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg\u2019s Hearthland Foundation, carried the sale past the finish line on Friday.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been involved in a project that had so many reasons for people to be cheering,\u201d Deutchman told The Post.\nThe Art Deco theater at 2626 Broadway entertained Upper West Siders with movie magic for nearly three quarters of a century before its previous owner shut its doors in 2005,citing untenable competitionwith megaplex movie theaters.\nAlbert Bialek, who purchased the property in the 1980s, gutted its interiors and struggled to lease the boarded-up building until his death in 2023.\nThe indie film-focused nonprofit aims to reinvent Metro Theater into a state-of-the-art five-screen cinema with education programs and a bistro.\nDeutchman said the neighborhood has long been a \u201ccinema desert,\u201d in need of a home for Upper West Siders to enjoy international and independent films.\nBroadway could also use the boost, Deutchman said. The Upper West Side\u2019s busiest commercial corridor was hit hard by pandemic-induced retail vacancies. Deutchman hopes the theater, located on Broadway near West 99th Street, will draw more pedestrian traffic and retail interest to the area.\nBut Deutchman and Monzier\u2019s dreams of lighting up the Metro Theater marquee once more are going to take a little more dough. The nonprofit has started up a capital campaign to the tune of $20 million to construct a new interior and make cosmetic enhancements to the iconic pink terracotta exterior.\nDeutchman told The Post that a small chunk of that $20 million has already been raised, so some improvements can get started.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been joking about the thing that the timeline is somewhere between two and 20 years, but in reality, what I hope is to try to get this done within three years,\u201d Deutchman said.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Lower prices on buildings mean lower prices for tenants, which could bring a wave of activity and energy to long-dormant buildings.",
        "content": "By Catherine Carlock, The Boston Globe\n\nThe old Barnes & Noble in Downtown Crossing has sat vacant for nearly two decades. It\u2019s a historic building on a corridor of Washington Street that\u2019s both bustling with pedestrians anddotted with vacancy signs. Out front, there\u2019s a payphone that still crackles when picked up anda piece of street artdesigned to spark renewed vitality into downtown.\n\nNow, 399 Washington has new life, in the form of new owners, who bought it at a bargain-basement price.\n\nEarlier this month, Boston-based Hudson Group and Assembly Investments of New York closed on their purchase of the retail and office building for $13 million \u2014 80 percent less than its prior sale in 2017. That sort of discount portends a difficult future ahead for Boston\u2019s budget,which is largely reliant on property taxes. But, as new owners Noam Ron and Evan Oscar Papanastasiou expect, it also means they can lower rents to the point where they can actually attract a tenant to abuilding where the ground floor hasbeen empty since 2006.\n\n\n399 Washington was family-owned for decades, until 2017 when Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management and L3 Capital bought it for $63 million. They then invested millions more into a full suite of upgrades: working bathrooms and elevators, new mechanical and HVAC systems. They stripped off the two-story gray slab that hung over the building\u2019s entrance for years, replacing it with tall expanses of metal and glass windows. The owners started marketing the retail space shortly after buying the building, and completed upgrades in 2021.\n\nBut tenants never came. And earlier this year, with office demand still weak following the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and no rental income coming in \u2014 399 Washingtonended up in a real-estate owned sale.\n\nThe prospect of a freshly overhauled building at a big discount drew interest from several investors \u2014 includingCeltics star Jaylen Brown\u2014 but thebid by Hudson and Assembly won. Now they plan tomarket the property at rents in the $40s per square foot, $7 to $10 less than the typical rent for Class B office space downtown, and around $20 less than what the prior owners would have had to charge, Papanastasiou said. Bringing in a ground-floor retailer, and resetting rents for offices up above, will bring an energy to the property that hasn\u2019t been seen in decades, the new owners said.\n\n\u201cThat will cast a wide net for tenancy,\u201d Papanastasiou said. \u201cJust lighting up this building is going to help tremendously.\u201d\n\n\nRon and Papanastasiou aren\u2019t alone. Amid abroad post-COVID reset in office valuesacross the city that has long-reluctant owners resigning themselves to selling at a loss, investors and developers are spying opportunity, eager to snap up well-located spaces \u2014 and then offer them to tenants at lower rents.\n\nOne such opportunistic investor is Broder, a Boston-based real estate investment and development firm that recently bought 15 Broad St. downtown. It\u2019s Broder\u2019s second time owning the building, which it sold to Brookfield Properties in 2016 for $32.5 million. In late 2019, just a few months before COVID hit Boston, Brookfield sold it to TA Realty for $46.1 million. Earlier this year, Broder bought it back, for $13.5 million \u2014 $5 million less than it first paid to buy it 18 years ago.\n\nBroder is privately funded with family wealth, and its portfolio has little debt, said managing partner Eric Svenson. (His and brother Ben Svenson\u2019s father, John Svenson,passed from cancer in 2007and was a prominent Boston real estate developer, philanthropist, and co-owner of the Boston Celtics.) TA\u2019s underwriting was reasonable when it bought the property, Svenson said, but the market shifts since are inescapable.\n\nThese days, groups that bought buildings prior to the pandemic and with a five- or seven-year mortgage find themselves withlittle option but to sell for a loss. That means opportunity for firms like his; Svenson said he\u2019d like to make several similar acquisitions this year.\n\n\u201cA lot of sellers are feeling like it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we had ten times the available capital we have. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for three decades and I\u2019ve never seen opportunities like this.\u201d\n\nProperties like 15 Broad St. and 399 Washington St. that have changed hands for significant discounts can give landlords flexibility to offer tenants space for a discount, or invest in modern amenities \u2014 a crucial factor in today\u2019s leasing landscape, said Wil Catlin, a senior partner with Boston Realty Advisors. But these days, Catlin noted,many tenants consider offices more an asset than a requirement, and they prize amenities and places for employees to connect with peers. So while pricing is important, it\u2019s not the only consideration.\n\n\n\u201cThe question is pricingfor what?\u201dCatlin said. \u201cFor a lack of a better term, it\u2019s got to feel good. You\u2019ve got to want to be there. If the owner is saying they get a $7 per square foot discount, and the employees and staff are not getting a differential experience, they\u2019re like: \u2018Uh, why are we here again?\u2018\u201d\n\nCatlin and other experts expect more deals like this as sales activity increases this year after a long slow period since COVID-19. Some of those sales will come as deep-pocketed global real estate owners pivot away from commercial real estate in an effort to curb future losses.\n\nPrivate equity behemoth Blackstone in 2023 told the Globe it would continue to pare back its office holdings. It paid around $156 million in January 2020 for a five-story brick-and-beam office at 179 Lincoln St. Last March, Blackstone handed both the building \u2014 and its $76.5 million in mortgage debt \u2014 over to Synergy Investments, according to Suffolk County records.\n\nMeanwhile Swiss bank UBS Group has been shedding office properties across the United States. In September, a UBS arm sold 400 Atlantic Ave., a six-story brick office facing Boston Harbor, for $30 million to the development arm of French financier Jacques Chahine, Suffolk County records show.\n\nThat\u2019s 40 percent less than the $50 million UBS paid to buy 400 Atlantic in 2014, and followedthe departure of long-term tenantGoulston & Storrs. Chahine Investment Corp. plans to convert the office to a hotel and restaurant, which would newly open to hotel customers a deck facing Boston Harbor that had been private for over 40 years, attorney Jared Eigerman wrote in a January letter of intent to the city\u2019s Planning Department.\n\nOver in Downtown Crossing, Papanastasiou and Ron said they\u2019re already in advanced conversations with several retailers to lease 399 Washington\u2019sexpansive first and second floor, which are connected by a striking brass staircase \u2014 a remnant of the Barnes & Noble days. They aim to sign an office lease soon for one of the upper floors. A fully built out office suite on the fourth floor, for example, is ready for a tenant any day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident we can lease that to an office tenant this year,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe\u2019re bullish on the future of downtown, and on this building.\u201d\n\n\nBe civil.

They\u2019re the current sellers \u2014 and the pair undertook a full, and opulent, remodel of the property.\n\u201cThe interior has been entirely transformed to this new white, black and gold, shiny, gaudy masterpiece,\u201d Compass agent Alessandro Corona told The Post.\nThe couple preserved Stamos\u2019 original design of the Mediterranean facade but gutted the \u201cvery \u201990s\u201d interiors, Corona said. He said the couple spent upwards of $3 million on the renovations.\nThe main living space features beautifully bookmatched panda marble, a two-sided fireplace and a massive crystal chandelier. Each of the seven bathrooms is sheathed in a different kind of marble, Corona said \u2014 and every toilet is clad in gold.\nIn addition to the luxe additions, Stamos\u2019 former recording studio was converted into an office, and a glam room designed for professional hair and makeup was added in the home\u2019s primary wing.\nCandace Aguilera is the CEO of the cosmetics brand Appeal and the daughter of Jeffrey Stanley, the founder of a large California bail agency, Bad Boys Bail Bonds. Her husband Justin has been linked to the family business as well, and unsuccessfully ran for election to represent California\u2019s 19th Congressional District as a Republican in 2018 and 2020.\nStamos sold the house in 2001 for $2.15 million after residing there for almost a decade, according to property records.\nThe Aguileras purchased the abode for $2.96 million in 2020, according to Zillow, and listed it for a rent of $50,000 in 2024 before putting it on the market this year.\nThe 6-acre property also includes a pool with stunning mountain views, multiple travertine terraces and, the listing notes, room for a helicopter pad. The estate also includes a detached guest suite with a private entrance.\nCorona anticipates that the listing will attract someone with celebrity status, with a need to live near Los Angeles.\n\u201cMost likely someone that would be looking for some level of seclusion and privacy,\u201d Corona said. \u201cIn addition to that, probably someone who has a flair for opulence.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "What time is it? The perfect time for someone to buy this standout Tribeca penthouse \u2014 one that\u2019s housed inside a historic, and stunning, clocktower.\nSeven years after Elad Group kicked off sales at 108 Leonard, the developer is unveiling the building\u2019s most coveted gem: \u201cThe Clock Tower\u201d penthouse.\nPriced at $19.25 million, this marquee residence \u2014 unit PHW \u2014 listed on Tuesday, marking its first time ever for sale.\nFor years, whispers about the mysterious triplex have swirled among New York\u2019s real estate elite \u2014 until now.\nThe penthouse\u2019s sprawling 8,770-square-foot interior is paired with 3,082 square feet of outdoor space \u2014 some of which directly surrounds the clock itself. It\u2019s all perched at the nexus of the building\u2019s north, west and south corners.\nHowever, the clock\u2019s immediate space, according to the floor plans, is very small \u2014 with no room to be habitable. The clock can be accessed via an antique spiral stair, should the owner want to admire its interior.\nUntil the building\u2019s redevelopment into residential units, the clocktower had been one of the few still functioning in the city \u2014 and one that was run purely by mechanical means. It was later electrified in 2023.\nInside, the triplex with ceilings soaring past 15 feet gives way to a dramatic spiral staircase that ascends into the clocktower.\nThe listing arrives at a pivotal moment for 108 Leonard. Just last week, the building\u2019s \u201cCrown Penthouse\u201d fetched $24.5 million, capping a bustling first quarter that saw seven contracts inked.\nMarch alone stood out, logging the highest number of sponsor deals above $20 million in New York City since September 2021, according to Marketproof data.\nWith fully built, move-in-ready condos in short supply \u2014 and uncertainty looming over construction costs amid potential tariff hikes \u2014 the timing couldn\u2019t be more opportune.\u00a0And now, it\u2019s time for this aerie to have its very first owner.\nAs Elena Sarkissian, the sales director for 108 Leonard with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve never listed it. This is the first time that it\u2019s on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe library is magnificent,\u201d Sarkissian added of the 16th-floor salon, which opens to the clock\u2019s turret, she likens to Batman\u2019s Gotham City. \u201cYou\u2019ll never make it again, you\u2019ll never see it again. It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s just so special.\u201d\nThe unit is made up of  five bedrooms, five full bathrooms and two full powder rooms.\nFor Elyse Leff, Elad Group\u2019s executive vice president of marketing and sales, the penthouse transcends typical real estate.\n\u201c\u2019The Clock Tower\u2019 penthouse is the crown jewel of 108 Leonard \u2014 a rare and magnificent residence that could never be replicated,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to own a McKim, Mead & White masterpiece in Tribeca and to live in a defining piece of the downtown skyline,\u201d she added, mentioning the famed architectural firm whose worldly designsdefined the pinnacleof Gilded Age New York.\nIndeed, the residence beckons a particular kind of buyer \u2014 one who cherishes history, architecture and the irreplaceable.\n\u201cNot just your everyday buyer,\u201d Sarkissian added, \u201cbut someone who really appreciates the provenance of this building and this particular residence.\u201d\nThe tale of 108 Leonard begins in the late 19th century, when it rose as the New York Life Insurance Company\u2019s headquarters, formerly 346 Broadway.\nDesigned by the legendary firm McKim, Mead & White \u2014 architects behind landmarks like the original Penn Station \u2014 the edifice was completed in phases. The eastern wing, started in 1894 under Stephen Decatur Hatch, was finished by McKim, Mead & White after Hatch\u2019s death in 1895. The western section, crowned by the three-story clocktower, followed between 1896 and 1898.\n(Architect Sam White, the great-grandson of the firm\u2019s final name, Stanford White, told The Post the building also notably stands out for its steel frame \u2014 a material that East Coast architects were slow to adopt, likely due its high cost.)\nThe clocktower looms over Broadway \u2014 its four 12-foot-diameter faces crafted by the E. Howard Watch and Clock Company, and adorned with Roman numerals.\nOnce, a colossal 33-foot sculpture by Philip Martiny \u2014 an octet of crouching Atlas figures cradling a hollow globe and an eagle \u2014 topped the tower. Though removed after 1928 and lost to time, the structure\u2019s ornate details, including hand-carved eagles and gargoyles lining its terrace balustrade, remain.\nBy 1987, the building earned New York City landmark status, celebrated for what the fifth edition of The A.I.A. Guide to New York City calls \u201cits wonderful Classical clock overlooking Broadway.\u201d\nIn 2013, developers the Peebles Corporation and Elad Group acquired the property from the Bloomberg mayoral administration for $160 million, embarking on a six-year transformation of the 19th-century palace into 152 condominiums.\nFor architect Tim Rooney, a partner at Jeffrey Beers International, which also had a hand in the building\u2019s look, this project was a rare privilege.\n\u201cThe whole building itself is really just a pleasure as a designer to work on,\u201d he told\u00a0The Post. \u201cHaving this really, kind of great building that you just don\u2019t find in Manhattan.\u201d\nThe goal was to create a space that feels timeless, despite its history of keeping time.\n\u201cThe idea was to take something historical and modernize it so it felt that it would be space that was handed down from generation to generation,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cAnd really, this was sort of the current generation\u2019s imprint on the space.\u201d\nInside the penthouse, a grand entry foyer spills into a 34-by-33-foot corner room, where a double-sided fireplace complements massive arched windows and ceilings topping 15 feet.\nThe primary suite, a 1,000-square-foot retreat, boasts a midnight bar, a windowed dressing room and a bathroom with a six-foot tub and a double shower clad in Calacatta black marble.\nUpstairs, a flexible suite of rooms invites customization \u2014 a wellness haven with a steam shower or sauna, perhaps, or a wine cellar.\nThe ascent to the clock tower\u2019s salon is the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\n\u201cMy first time in the clocktower itself, inside the actual space, was magical,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cIt is like being transported back in time.\u201d\nSurrounded by a 2,000-square-foot wraparound terrace, the pedestal level of the clock offers sweeping vistas \u2014 the Chrysler and Empire State buildings, the Hudson River, the close-by Woolworth Building and beyond.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the terrace,\u201d Sarkissian says, \u201cyou pick up the rivers on both sides. I mean it\u2019s really spectacular.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the main space and then as you make your way up the space, it becomes a little bit smaller, but your sort of on this secret journey on your way to the clock tower itself,\u201d he said.\nThis is no common penthouse.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one very lucky buyer ahead,\u201d Sarkissian\u00a0 said.\nAdvertisement",

The former party pad, located in Marylebone, asks $7 million.\nJagger was able to lease the space in 1966 thanks to the runaway success of \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d and \u201cGet Off My Cloud.\u201d\nThe 2,495-square-foot residence is also where Jagger began his highly publicized relationship with singer Marianne Faithfull \u2014 and where he and bandmate Keith Richards threw famously heavy parties, according to Jagger\u2019s biographer Chris Salewicz in the book \u201cMick & Keith: Parallel Lines.\u201d\nThe four-bedroom home features 10-foot ceilings, parquet flooring, French windows and a balcony that runs the entire width of the apartment, according to the listing brokerages Beauchamp Estates and Prime London.\nThe apartment includes two reception rooms, a home cinema and a library. A large bay window brings light into the large primary bedroom; its ensuite bath has stone walls and a freestanding tub.\nListing photos show an understated home with clean lines and simple fixtures \u2014\u00a0highly incompatible with the vision of a \u201960s rock star\u2019s party-filled crash pad. Jagger\u2019s brief residence saw swarms of photographers visit in 1967, after it was rumored that he took LSD, and served as the backdrop for now-iconic photoshoots by Gered Mankowitz.\nThe Stones went on to release \u201cPaint it Black\u201d and other hits during Jagger\u2019s tenure at the apartment, which ended in 1968 when Jagger and Faithfull moved to an apartment in Belgravia. The pair split up in 1970.\nThe spacious residence is located inside a landmarked Edwardian mansion, called Harley House, built between 1903 and 1904 to house Irish migrants\u00a0working as servants for their wealthy neighbors.\nThe listing brokerages say this offering will lure in a specific kind of interest.\n\u201cWe anticipate the listing will attract significant interest from discerning buyers and fans of The Rolling Stones from around the world,\u201d said Jeremy Gee, the managing director of Beauchamp Estates, in a statement.\nAdvertisement",

Considering that the median sales price of a single-family home in Greater Boston was $883,000 in February 2025 \u2014 up almost 13 percent year-over-year, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors \u2014 many wannabe move-up buyers are finding themselves stuck at home.Patrick Hope invested $130,000 to put a 500-square-foot addition onto his home, creating two more bedrooms so his sons could have their own rooms - and privacy. Patrick Hope\u201cHome prices are only getting more expensive, and the [mortgage] rates haven\u2019t dropped, so a lot of homeowners are trapped,\u201d said Morgan Franklin, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Realty in Boston. \u201cThey might be younger couples who maybe went from one child to two or three, and they now need more space.\u201dAdvertisementLuckily, there are relatively low-cost improvements that can make a big difference in your home \u2014 to refresh it, make it more livable, and enhance your enjoyment of the space until the time comes \u2014 if it does \u2014 to move into a larger place.Patrick Hope, 45, purchased a two-bedroom, one-and-one-half-bath home in Medway in August 2012, paying $270,000 and financing it with a 3.5 percent mortgage. At first, Hope\u2019s two sons were sharing a bedroom. As they got older, the boys needed more privacy.Patrick Hope purchased a two-bedroom home in Medway in August 2012.Patrick HopeHope considered moving, but interest rates and prices had risen substantially in surrounding neighborhoods. So, Hope invested $130,000 into improving his 1,291-square-foot home, building a 500-square-foot addition with two additional bedrooms. He also replaced the roof and siding.Advertisement\u201cIt allowed for personal space for the kids, which freed up some of the downstairs living space,\u201d said Hope, who works in product marketing for a tech company. \u201cI don\u2019t see the market changing any time soon, so I built the house I wanted instead of buying something else.\u201dJasmine Edo, 34, lives in a 950-square-foot condominium in Revere on the second floor of the building, but would like to have a backyard for her dog to enjoy. She purchased her home in September 2020 for $285,000, but due to the high housing costs and her 3.5 percent mortgage rate, she felt stuck.\u201cMy only option was to make the place more livable, to upgrade,\u201d said Edo, a wealth planner.Jasmine Edo would like more space and a backyard, but at today's high Boston housing prices, she can't afford to either rent or pay a mortgage on a larger place. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffShe invested about $5,000 to repaint, replace a sliding glass door, upgrade the electrical system, and replace ceiling fans and light fixtures. Now she\u2019s saving for larger projects, like new floors and a new kitchen and bathroom.\u201cYou just have to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to enjoy the space you live in, so whatever you need to do to make it better for you, just make it happen.\u201dLee Bardin, owner of Expert Renovation Team in Newton, said there are many projects homeowners can make to create more usable space if they are stuck in a small home.Finishing a basement, for example, typically costs $20,000 to $25,000, he said. Due to code requirements, he recommends using that space as a home office or gym, not a bedroom.Converting a porch into a finished den would typically run $25,000 to $30,000, he said, and minor updates to a kitchen, such as cabinet refacing ($8,000), new quartz countertops ($5,000), and a tile backsplash ($2,500) could significantly enhance the room.AdvertisementJasmine Edo has done some minor home improvement projects, such as interior painting, replacing a sliding glass door, painting a deck, and installing new lights and a ceiling fan. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\u201cConsider taking out the wall between the kitchen and the dining room or living room to have more flowing space,\u201d said Bardin of a project that would cost about $12,000.One of the least expensive improvements he recommends is painting, which can transform a room. Costs typically run $600 to $800 per room for walls, $400 for ceilings, and $500 for trim and doors, he said.",

        "content": "It was almost midnight when the smoke detector went off again. Angel Santiago expected his new home to have some quirks: It was built in Salem in 1812. But he\u2019d failed to uncover why the attic smoke detector continued to beep in the absence of smoke. A recent first-time home buyer, he headed upstairs and unscrewed the device.\u201cOh my gosh, [it was] just full of ants,\u201d he said.As insects and their eggs cascaded to the floor, Santiago shuttled the alarm outside, an early lesson in homeownership underway. He learned that ants nesting in smoke alarms can trigger the device. It would be the first of many lessons.For some first-time homeowners, year one can serve as a crash course \u2014 from finance to maintenance to design \u2014 following an already complex purchase process. The barriers are high, and those who manage to do it are fewer than ever. The market share of first-time home buyers sunk to a historic low of 24 percent in 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).AdvertisementOnce in a new home, experts say there are some first-year moves that homeowners can make to set them up for short- and long-term success. You can start before the keys are in hand.\u201cThe ones I get most worried about are the folks that are taking every dime they have and putting it into just getting the house,\u201d said Elliot Schmiedl, director of home ownership with the Massachusetts Housing Partnership (MHP). \u201cThey have very few reserves available to them after they close, because you never know when the boiler is going to break, or the roof springs a leak, or the sewer pipe gets clogged, and these things are increasingly more and more expensive.\u201dAdvertisementMany home-buying courses are aimed at pre-purchase education, but MHP also facilitates HomeSafe post-purchase classes designed to support stability.Angel Santiago and his wife, Jordan, are first-time home buyers who were able to purchase the home on the left in Salem. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffGeorge Koutsos, a mortgage loan officer with CrossCountry Mortgage, counsels clients to keep three months of mortgage payments on hand for emergencies (and ideally, six). Staying in touch with lenders can alert owners to future drops in interest rates. For long-term security, consider establishing a trust, and it\u2019s never too early to draft a will, said Koutsos.Understanding which public resources may help in the early days can ease startup costs, said Jin Min Lee, homeownership and counseling program manager for the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation. Lee was a home buyer education student in that program before taking on her management role.In the early days of home ownership, self-advocacy is key, said Lee.\u201cI do feel like there\u2019s this kind of posture of\u2026 curiosity and humility and persistence that\u2019s required through the purchase process and also your first year,\u201d said Lee. \u201cBecause most of us just don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know \u2026 It\u2019s okay to ask questions, it\u2019s okay to really be persistent, and where there\u2019s one closed door, I\u2019m gonna find another door that\u2019s open.\u201dScheduling a Mass Save home energy audit is one example of a great early resource, said Lee, as is applying for resident tax rates for the new address, which can save hundreds if not thousands of dollars.AdvertisementNew homeowners can be attractive targets for sales pitches, and knowing how to navigate them will help.\u201cI think everybody who buys a home is going to quickly get started getting solicited,\u201d said Schmiedl.Instead of rushing into potentially costly improvement projects, slow down.\u201cLive in it for a year,\u201d said Schmiedl.A historical marker hangs on the front of Angel and Jordan Santiago\u2019s home in Salem. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffRushing design changes can interfere with function before owners get a chance to live in the home.Allison Tilly Carswell and Andrea Canty, of Red Door Design + Staging, suggested pausing before rushing toward trendy upgrades, such as recessed lighting and open floor plans. Recessed lighting is really best used to illuminate the path in hallways, or to light a kitchen work area. Lamps are more configurable elsewhere.\u201cWe\u2019ve walked into a space and said something like, \u2018You might enjoy your home more if there [was] a wall here separating the entryway from your living room,\u2019 and the homeowners say, \u2018Oh, we took that wall down,\u2018\u201d said Carswell.To figure out a design that fits your lifestyle, prioritize heavily used rooms first, said Canty. And paint can go a long way to refresh previous renovations that may not match your tastes, such as on cabinetry.\u201cDon\u2019t try and fill the house right away,\u201d said Robin Gannon, a Lexington-based designer with national clientele. Live with what you have in order to help you assess the flow and use of a space before investing in higher-quality pieces. In week one, that won\u2019t be clear.\u201cYou\u2019re buying somebody else\u2019s taste,\u201d said Gannon.Spend some time reflecting on your own style, she said. A few quality placeholders can help along the way, such as Sisal rugs to unify a room. Try a bold wall color. And in a year, you can always repaint.Advertisement\u201cDon\u2019t listen to your friends \u2014 listen to your gut,\u201d said Gannon.Social media and AI design schemes can intrude on taste. Algorithmic churn can be self-reinforcing, as it spits out more examples like what you\u2019ve already looked for, said Gannon.\u201cI always say, you can like something but not necessarily want to live with it,\u201d she said.To break that cycle, Gannon suggested cross-referencing magazines and different manufacturers rather than following a social media rabbit hole.It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed in the first year of homeownership.\u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in this house that\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d said Santiago, who said he has made an effort to do his own repairs when possible, saving hundreds on smaller projects. He was quickly able to swap out the smoke detectors and manage the ants himself.\u201cIf you break it down and do one thing at a time, it\u2019s very manageable,\u201d he said.Santiago paid $656,500 for the three-story, two-family home with town house-style units (front and back), which he said helped qualify for the loan. A first-generation homeowner in his family, he saw gaps in home buyer education, which he said didn\u2019t address post-move issues. Santiago has since acquired his own real estate license with the hope of providing a different experience for others.Establishing a home in the first year can mean more than new boilers and bathroom renovations.\u201cHome is a home, but it\u2019s part of [a] community as well,\u201d said Schmiedl. \u201cA lot of good can come from that.\u201dAs Santiago began work on his home\u2019s exterior, he discovered several bottles and silverware items dating back to the 1850s. But the project turned up more than artifacts.Advertisement\u201cFrom all the hours and hours and hours of work\u2026 I met all of our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s gonna be on the other side. \u201cMaybe you meet somebody new, or maybe you find a cool bottle.\u201dLindsay Crudele can be reached at lcrudele@gmail.com.",

Today, Millinocket is up and coming as a four-season tourist attraction. The gateway to Mount Katahdin, Maine\u2019s highest mountain, Moosehead Lake, and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, the town exemplifies Vacationland.

One of these is East Longmeadow, situated in the Pioneer Valley between Springfield and the towns of northern Connecticut. East Longmeadow was once a center of red and brown sandstone quarrying: the stone making up the original building of Washington\u2019s Smithsonian Institution museum is from here. The Elijah Burt House, built between 1720 and 1740, is worth a visit. It is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the town, and a station on the Underground Railroad.Center Barnstead, N.H.AdvertisementNew Hampshire real estate prices have been rising, but the occasional quality home for under $400,000 still exists. An area to search is Center Barnstead, a community in the town of Barnstead and the largest of several villages in the town. It is close to the Lakes Region, which has convenient access to the hundreds of lakes south of the White Mountains. There you will find ski areas, art galleries, beaches, restaurants, ice cream shops, and all the other destinations vacationers seek, but with rural tranquility and scenic beauty.AdvertisementA resort in New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains region. Julia TiltonEastport, MaineFor good reason, the coast of Maine is a magnet for vacationers. With its countless harbors, coves, headlands, beaches, and islands, it is unparalleled for scenic beauty, fresh air, and fresh lobster. But, as with any desirable area, it is pricey, with houses in coastal towns fetching far more than inland real estate.This changes as you leave behind the crowds of the mid-coast and head Down East to Washington County. At the end of the road, at the Canadian border, is Eastport. With just a little over 1,000 people, it is the least-populous city in Maine, but also one of its most historic: Eastport celebrated its bicentennial in 1998.It is one of the most festival-minded communities in Maine. Navy ships have docked here during the Fourth of July celebration for many years. Every September, the city hosts the annual Maine Salmon Festival in the historic downtown district, and, for 20 years, there has been a Pirate Festival the weekend after Labor Day.Wardsboro, Vt.Vermont has maple syrup, great cheese, legendary ski mountains, picture-perfect villages, and cows grazing on hillsides unspoiled by billboards or strip malls. In the southern part of the state, between Mount Snow and Stratton Mountain in the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forest, is Wardsboro.This small town encompasses five villages, one of which literally has the name Podunk. Wardsboro has scenic beauty and recreational opportunities \u2014 Somerset Reservoir and Grout Pond are minutes from Main Street, and the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers Snowmobile trails run through the town \u2014 but none of the crowds and condos of nearby ski areas.AdvertisementEustis, MaineHunters, hikers, nature lovers, and those who simply want to get away from it all head to the pine-scented peace of Maine\u2019s western mountains. Eustis, which includes the village of Stratton, is located about halfway between Sugarloaf Mountain and the Canadian border. It is on the Dead River, which provided transportation for Benedict Arnold and his troops in 1775, when they made their way to fight in the ill-fated Battle of Quebec. Later, the river was known for log drives, which involved floating wood down the river to mills, a deadly practice that was banned in 1976. Now the Dead River is a popular destination for white-water rafting.",

Those buyers should take a different approach to renovating.\u201cThe equity builder looks for the tired house where the owner prioritized substance over style,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can transform dated kitchens and baths without gut renovations using smart refreshes: new appliances, countertops, and strategic paint choices. Remember: the moment you fall in love with the project is the moment your profit margin starts shrinking.\u201dAdvertisementFor the dream creators, it\u2019s different.

That means there is a lot of wear-and-tear and inevitable repairs to consider tackling. When is it time to stay, and when is it time to go when dealing with drafty windows, a cracked foundation, or other signs of \u2014 shall we say, maturity?Cracks in the foundation will be an expensive fix.\n\n Amy Newman/Globe File Photo\u201cThe current market is tough for first-time buyers,\u201d said Eric Sugrue, a Redfin Boston agent. \u201cThe inventory of available houses to buy has never been lower in our market. Most buyers realize they will have to compromise.\u201dBuy a home warranty or negotiate one from the seller to provide peace of mind that at least all of the mechanicals are covered, Sugrue said, before emphasizing that buyers remember the acronym PEACH: Plumbing, Electrical, Air Conditioning, and Heating.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the aesthetic design aspects when touring a home, but it\u2019s important that buyers \u2014 and especially first-time buyers \u2014 focus more on the things that either they can\u2019t change or can cost them a lot of money down the road,\u201d added Amanda Pendleton, a Zillow home trends expert.Location and layout are hard to change, so if you aren\u2019t satisfied with those, it might be best to find another home. But nice-to-have things like a chef\u2019s kitchen are easier to add down the line. Buyers should look for signs of pests and structural damage: Visible water damage, uneven floorboards, and gaps in windows or doors can be a sign of problems becoming bigger issues if they aren\u2019t fixed, Pendleton said.AdvertisementWhile all of those interviewed for this story emphasized the importance of working with experienced real estate agents and conducting a full home inspection for true peace of mind, they also noted there\u2019s no one-issue-applies-to-all when it comes to home buying.\u201cThat is a very challenging question to answer, because it\u2019s so much about personal preference,\u201d said Sarah Gustafson, president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cEach house is unique, and it\u2019s unique to the buyer who is buying.

        "hed": "Can accessory dwelling units ease the Cape\u2019s housing crisis?",
        "subhead": "",
        "content": "When Jayne O\u2019Brien lost her husband Bill suddenly in March 2024, she faced two difficult challenges. While dealing with shock and grief, she also wondered where she would live. The couple had been living in Bill\u2019s home in Eastham during their five-year marriage, but after his death, his daughter inherited the house.O\u2019Brien, 71, still owned a home in nearby Brewster, which she\u2019d been renting to her son and his girlfriend. Her son promptly offered to move out, but O\u2019Brien declined.A friend put O\u2019Brien in touch with a Maine-based company called Backyard ADUs, which builds accessory dwelling units. Defined as a secondary residential living space located on the same lot as a single-family home, an ADU can be a freestanding structure or a unit attached to the primary home. They\u2019ve caught on as an affordable way to address housing shortages in states from California to Maine. O\u2019Brien\u2019s son was immediately on board with building one.This 740-square-foot model unit in Cotuit features one bedroom, one bathroom, an open-concept living room, and a flexible bonus room.Backyard ADUsAdvertisement\u201cWe talked a lot about how to do this and still preserve independence and privacy for both of us,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.ADUs are poised for expansion on Cape Cod: The Affordable Homes Act, which went into effect on Feb. 2, now requires municipalities to permit the building of ADUs in single-family zoning districts throughout Massachusetts, relieving a range of zoning challenges that prevented people from building ADUs across the state.ADU growth will be especially beneficial in places like the Cape, where the cost of housing \u2014 and renovating \u2014 is prohibitively expensive. The annual median sales price of a single-family home in Barnstable County increased from $433,000 in 2019 to $730,000 in 2023, according to the Cape Cod Commission, an organization that works to address the region\u2019s housing crisis and develop innovative land use policies.Advertisement\u201cAccessory dwelling units are one of the many tools that we can employ to develop more affordable housing options,\u201d explained Kristy Senatori, executive director of the commission. \u201cThey\u2019re not a panacea, but it is relatively easy to add units or density to an existing neighborhood through the use of ADUs while maintaining the architectural character of the area. Certainly that\u2019s critical to Cape Cod\u2019s identity and our economy on the Cape.\u201dIn addition to serving as homes for aging relatives, ADUs also can support the Cape\u2019s year-round population by providing a source of rental income.\u201cOur clients are definitely interested in it, both buyers and sellers,\u201d said Katie Clancy, sales vice president at William Raveis Real Estate in Yarmouth Port. \u201cLenders are seizing the opportunity, too, by letting borrowers use potential ADU income count in the mortgage apps.\u201dTim O\u2019Reilly, director of preconstruction for Backyard ADUs, says the majority of their business is building 500 to-1,200 square-foot homes for multigenerational living.\u201cWe\u2019re often designing with an aging in place lens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had folks who said \u2018Hey, I built this for my adult son with disabilities, or for my mom.\u2019 Or \u2018Hey, I could rent this out for several years and pay down my costs, then move my family in.\u2018\u201dO\u2019Reilly emphasized the range of success stories. \u201cIt\u2019s about having that flexibility \u2014 it\u2019s in my backyard, and now I can do what makes the most sense,\u201d he said.AdvertisementNow, O\u2019Brien is a few weeks out from moving into a 642-square-foot abode in her backyard. As a self-described outdoors person, she isn\u2019t concerned about the limited living space, as she relishes her large deck, outdoor shower, and sizable yard for gardening.\u201cI do feel like [my son] and I are the poster family for the necessity and benefits of zoning that allows for ADUs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an affordable option and one that will enhance my property now and in the future.\u201d",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "For decades, people have bought property with a partner or their biological family members. But amid a skyrocketing housing market and loneliness becoming a public health epidemic, aspiring buyers are looking beyond the traditional nuclear family to find new financial and social solutions to homeownership.At the end of April, Harvard Law School plans to release a landmark guidebook called \u201cHow to Buy Property with Chosen Family,\u201d which addresses how to approach traditional institutions such as banks and real estate agencies as a nontraditional unit. The first-of-its-kind primer, which will be published by the school\u2019s LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic, is for people trying to buy a home with friends or anyone hoping to live in a nonstandard structure.The arrangement is often associated with polyamory, but the clinic emphasizes that the guide can apply to a group of friends, multiple families, or anybody who wants to break into the housing market but doesn\u2019t have the desire or resources to go it alone. The guide offers strategies such as creating a tenancy in common agreement or an LLC, which offers ownership agreements and stipulates financial consequences in case a living arrangement goes south.\u201cAmong a lot of people I know, this is the main way that they see themselves being able to [buy] \u2014 and it also seems like a much better idea than becoming isolated in your own little suburban enclave without access to community,\u201d said Samara Trilling, a third-year Harvard Law student who coauthored the guidebook in collaboration with the Polyamory Legal Advocacy Coalition (PLAC).AdvertisementThe guide comes at the right time, Trilling said, as more people simply crave community and homeownership. The structure \u2014 romantic or platonic \u2014 makes financial sense, and the guide\u2019s release coincides with a shift in household demographics. As of 2025, an estimated 61 million Americans (nearly 20 percent of the population) co-own a home with someone who isn\u2019t their spouse, according to a new survey by CoBuy, an end-to-end platform to simplify nontraditional home buying.Advertisement\u201cMany people are not in a nuclear family. That is just not the state of American families anymore. ... And cities are sort of having to grapple with: Wait a second. If that\u2019s not actually reflecting our constituents, how do we build in pathways toward generational wealth that actually can meet people where they\u2019re at?\u201d said Kimberly Rhoten, a PLAC cofounder.Somerville is a groundbreaking example. In 2020, spurred by COVID and the desire for all people to easily visit loved ones in the hospital, the City Council passed an ordinance recognizing domestic partnerships, including polyamorous relationships. Somerville again made news in 2023 when the City Council approved a unique anti-discrimination ordinance to protect people in polyamorous and other consensually nonmonogamous relationships. The ordinance prohibits discrimination in employment and policing against those in relationships of two or more people.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from people who moved to our community specifically because of these [2023] laws and because of the domestic partnership ordinance that passed in 2020,\u201d said Willie Burnley Jr., a Somerville city councilor-at-large and mayoral candidate who is polyamorous and rents his home with platonic roommates.Somerville City Councilor-at-Large Willie Burnley Jr. outside The Burren, which he said might be torn down for a high-rise housing complex. John Tlumacki/Globe StaffPLAC has done similar work in Cambridge, and the progress has been logistically helpful to home buyers \u2014 but also symbolic to people who often feel stigmatized due to lifestyle choices, proponents said.AdvertisementHeath Schechinger, another PLAC cofounder and executive director of the nationwide Modern Family Institute, enjoyed lower utility costs and a bigger home than he would have otherwise afforded while living with two other couples. Of course, the arrangement wasn\u2019t perfect.\u201cI didn\u2019t have this unilateral capacity to make decisions on my own or that I thought would be best,\u201d Schechinger said. \u201cAlso, there was some social stigma.\u201dBut the benefits were worth it, and Schechinger is hopeful that laws and housing models will catch up to prospective homeowners\u2019 financial and social realities.\u201cAn increasing number of people are living with their chosen family: buying homes with friends or partners, or building family through shared values rather than marriage. The future of family isn\u2019t about form. It\u2019s about function \u2014 and who you build your life with.\u201dKara Baskin can be reached at kara.baskin@globe.com. Follow her @kcbaskin.",

Melvin Vieira, a real estate broker and former head of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, equated buyers going into home sales without an agent to someone going to court without an attorney, but added that the agent needed to be reliable.Proper agents can prevent a buyer from being misled during the sale, and can help them avoid pitfalls like shoddy home inspections and unscrupulous lenders, among other things.Advertisement\u201cBuyer\u2019s agents work with the buyer\u2019s attorney to make sure, among many other things, that the title is clear and the lender is reputable,\u201dVieira said.The new law, which went into effect in August 2024, said home buyers must engage \u2014 at their expense \u2014 a broker looking out for their best interests. Before, the seller was in effect paying part of the buyer agent\u2019s fee.Sandrine Deschaux, who\u2019s been selling real estate in Greater Boston for two decades, estimates the fee ranges from 2.5 percent to 3 percent of the final property price.\u201cYou can structure the agreement as you want. You can make it an a la carte deal,\u201d she said.Deschaux said the agent and buyer work together to find the right product.Advertisement\u201cThe agent must assess your tolerance for risk-taking.

        "subhead": "What sparked the FIRE movement?",
        "content": "In a world where avocado toast and side hustles have come to define\u00a0financial discourse\u00a0for younger generations,\u00a0Gen Z\u00a0is reshaping the conversation entirely.\nInstead of working their way up the corporate ladder or banking on a pension that may never materialize, many are turning to a radical new goal:retiring\u00a0by 40.\nThe strategy behind this ambition is the FIRE movement, short for \u201cfinancial independence, retire early.\u201d Popularized on social media platforms, FIRE proselytizes with a simple but strict philosophy: Embrace extreme frugality now to unlock early retirement later.\nFor a generation that came of age amid a pandemic,\u00a0record-highstudent debt, a volatile job market, and an uncertain housing future, FIRE offers something refreshingly hopeful: control.\nBut as more Gen Zers chase early retirement, one big question lingers: Can they alsoafford to own a home?\nThe FIRE philosophy dates back to the mid-1990s andYour Money or Your Life, the influential book by\u00a0Vicki Robin\u00a0and\u00a0Joe Dominguez.\u00a0The authors called for a radical rethink of money and time, urging readers to live simply, question consumer culture, and define success on their own terms.\nAt its heart, FIRE isn\u2019t just about money. It\u2019s equal parts self-help and personal-finance advice, challenging the cultural norm of tying identity to consumption and encouraging intentional, values-driven living instead.\nFor Gen Z, that message has struck a chord. On platforms likeRedditandTikTok, #FIRE content often includes budget breakdowns, DIY money hacks, and ultrafrugal meals\u2014like creator\u00a0Mia McGrath\u2019s famous50p eggs, which cost just 65 cents per serving.\nFor many Gen Zers, homeownershipfeels increasingly out of reach. Despite having\u00a0more saved\u00a0than their elder millennial counterparts, just\u00a018% of Gen Z owns a home\u2014largely due to record-high prices, rising interest rates, and stagnant wages. That creates tension with FIRE\u2019s core tenets: low expenses and high savings.\n\u201cOne of the main drawbacks to the FIRE movement is that it can be difficult for people to achieve the level of financial management they need to be able to retire early,\u201d says\u00a0Liz Hunter, commercial director atMoney Expert.\n\u201cIf you have a mortgage to pay, for example, you need to be able to make sure you can keep up with your repayments while you\u2019re budgeting.\u201d\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nLet\u2019s break it down.\nFIRE recommends saving 50% to 75% of your income at a minimum. Common wisdom recommends spending no more than\u00a030% of your income on housing.\nTo afford the\u00a0monthly mortgage\u00a0on a median-priced U.S. home of $420,000, while living off half of their income and spending no more than 30% of that on housing, a FIRE homebuyer would need to earn at least $209,000 a year\u2014a salary few 20-somethings command.\nSo, can Gen Z FIRE followers still buy a home?\n\u201cNever say never,\u201d says\u00a0Emily Zekonis, finance expert (and Gen Zer herself) fromRaisin. \u201cTo do both at the same time is probably out of reach for most people but, for example, if you live in a very low cost-of-living area but are making a large salary, you may be able to fill both buckets at the same time.\u201d\nMore realistically, most young adults will have to choose between FIRE and homeownership. Or, at the very least, compromise on one to make space for the other. That might mean saving a little less aggressively in favor of buying a home \u2014 or opting for a smaller property in a more affordable market.\n\u201cLike most things, restriction is great in moderation,\u201d Zekonis adds.\n\u201cThe discipline you need tosave up for buying a home(or pursuing FIRE) is required to get you where you want to be. But it can be easy to get carried away, and there\u2019s a distinction between discipline and deprivation. If home ownership is important to you, it\u2019s certainly OK to prioritize this goal and orient your finances in support of that.\u201d\nFIRE offers Gen Z a powerful vision: financial freedom, early retirement, and a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around a nine-to-five. That focus on independence is reshaping the American dream, trading the high-cost mortgage and white picket fence for a more flexible, and often more affordable, rent check.\nStill, Gen Z isn\u2019t shying away from hard financial choices. They\u2019re simply rewriting the rules. Whether that means renting forever and retiring early, buying a home and working longer, or finding a middle ground, one thing\u2019s clear: This generation is more intentional than ever about how they spend, save, and plan for the future.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "This Soho apartment rocks \u2014 so much so that grunge music queen Courtney Love once owned it.\nNow, the Hole frontwoman\u2019s former lair has listed for $9.49 million, The Post has learned.\nLocated at 30 Crosby St., the property offers a rare glimpse intothe new grandmother\u2019sNew York chapter, whichbegan in 2001when she traded Beverly Hills for Manhattan.\nLove, the 60-year-old widow of Nirvana icon Kurt Cobain, acquired the unfinished loft in 2001 for $2.64 million, becoming its first owner following a condo conversion from a manufacturing building.\nThe move came seven years following Cobain\u2019s 1994 suicide, and marked a significant shift from her West Coast roots.\nLove, a California native, had previously lived in a four-bedroom Beverly Hills estate, purchased in 1997 from comedian Ellen DeGeneres for $3 million. That property, which she renovated to include a gym, sat on 2 acres and featured a cement pond. Love listed it for just under $4 million before heading east.\nThis Soho loft, spanning 4,123 square feet, boasts three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nLove held the property until 2006, when financial pressures forced a sale.\nPublic records indicate she parted ways with it for $5 million, unable to keep pace with the mortgage.\nLove\u2019s departure from New York in 2006 marked her return to the West Coast, but in later years she still had a bit of New York presence. A2011 Vanity Fair profileby Nancy Jo Sales detailed Love residing in a West Village townhouse at 27 Bank St. for $27,000 per month \u2014 one that she filled with cupcakes, even though she declared she had only $894 in the bank \u2014 where she had allegedly done $100,000 in interior damages, according to court documents.\nThe unit\u2019s current owner is Stefan Sonnenfeld, a titan in the film industry known for revolutionizing digital color grading.\nSonnenfeld, who paid $7.07 million for the loft in 2012, has been dubbed the \u201cda Vinci of the movies\u201d for his work on blockbusters like \u201cPirates of the Caribbean,\u201d \u201cTransformers\u201d and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d As a co-founder of Company 3, he pioneered the digital intermediate process, reshaping how Hollywood crafts its visual stories.\nThe listing paints a vivid picture of the space, with a seeming nod to Love: \u201ca sprawling pre-war condo loft that exudes rockstar energy and downtown sophistication,\u201d it says.\nIt highlights a private elevator opening to a foyer that flows into a grand living area, drenched in light from oversize industrial windows.\nExposed brick, wooden columns, a gas fireplace and towering ceilings blend the building\u2019s 1890s origins with modern polish.\nThe kitchen, designed for entertaining, features dual Sub-Zero refrigerators, a wine cooler, double ovens and a vented cooktop.\nThe primary suite offers a vast dressing room and a spa-inspired bathroom, complete with double sinks, a soaking tub and a separate shower. Additional perks include a laundry room and ample storage.\nHoly Sose, Katie Johnson and Sabine Modeste of the Corcoran Group hold the listing.\nBuilt in 1890, 30 Crosby stands as a seven-story landmark with just 13 residences. Amenities include round-the-clock doorman service and a wine room.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Buyers in these southern US cities are spoiled for choice.\nSpring is ahot time for the real estate market, and these sweltering cities have a lot to offer. While high prices and elevated mortgage costs have put off buyers across the country, some markets in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana have further lagged thanks to surplus housing stock and sluggish listings.\nLong spells on the market and widespread price cuts may indicate that some once-eager buyers are turning away from life in these cities. If you\u2019re not, though, it\u2019s time to head south.\nThese five southern cities \u2014 Miami, Jackson, Tampa, New Orleans and Memphis \u2014 all landed on Zillow\u2019s\u201cbest metro areas for buyers\u201dlist based on the balance of sale-supply and demand in these markets.\nThe Daily Mailfirst reportedon the data.\nInterested buyers flocked to Florida cities like Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa during the pandemic, and eager developers followed. Housing largely kept up with demand, but the excess stock has turned these once red-hot locales into buyers\u2019 markets.\nBuyers in Miami can be leisurely, and not just because of the sun and sand. Homes are staying on the market for a median of 60 days \u2014\u00a0nearly three times longer than the rest of the country. A quarter of Miami listings also got price reductions in February, Zillow reported.\nJacksonville, the birthplace of Southern rock, boasts 22 miles of white sand beaches and plentiful price cuts. Nearly 30% of home sellers dropped their prices in February, and inventory was up more than 26% year-over-year.\nIn Tampa, inventory was 19.8% higher than it was compared to the same period last year. Nearly one-third for for-sale homes in Tampa took a price cut in February, as well.\nMeanwhile, populations have recently been on the decline in both Memphis and New Orleans.\nNew Orleans, known for its vibrant nightlife and delicious cuisine, has significantly more homes on the market today than before the pandemic, according to Zillow \u2014 42% more. The average home in New Orleans stayed on the market for a median of 58 days as of February, giving buyers greater bargaining power.\nBuyers in Memphis, a highly affordable city with a rich musical history, save more money with a mortgage than a lease, Zillow reported. The typical mortgage payment \u2014 20% down, 30-year fixed \u2014 is $1,228, while typical rents in the Tennessee city hover around $1,400.\nBut, as the Daily Mail reported, the sluggish uptake of so much inventory isn\u2019t simply due to extra homes and high prices. Once-frenzied buyers may be removing their rose colored glasses and contending with the issues of severe weather, flooding, crime and poverty in these metros.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By  Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nIt was almost midnight when the smoke detector went off again. Angel Santiago expected his new home to have some quirks: It was built in Salem in 1812. But he\u2019d failed to uncover why the attic smoke detector continued to beep in the absence of smoke. A recent first-time home buyer, he headed upstairs and unscrewed the device.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, [it was] just full of ants,\u201d he said.\n\nAs insects and their eggs cascaded to the floor, Santiago shuttled the alarm outside, an early lesson in homeownership underway. He learned that ants nesting in smoke alarms can trigger the device. It would be the first of many lessons.\n\nFor some first-time homeowners, year one can serve as a crash course \u2014 from finance to maintenance to design \u2014 following an already complex purchase process. The barriers are high, and those who manage to do it are fewer than ever. The market share of first-time home buyers sunk to a historic low of 24 percent in 2024, according to theNational Association of Realtors(NAR).\n\n\n\nOnce in a new home, experts say there are some first-year moves that homeowners can make to set them up for short- and long-term success. You can start before the keys are in hand.\n\n\u201cThe ones I get most worried about are the folks that are taking every dime they have and putting it into just getting the house,\u201d said Elliot Schmiedl, director of home ownership with theMassachusetts Housing Partnership(MHP). \u201cThey have very few reserves available to them after they close, because you never know when the boiler is going to break, or the roof springs a leak, or the sewer pipe gets clogged, and these things are increasingly more and more expensive.\u201d\n\nMany home-buying courses are aimed at pre-purchase education, but MHP also facilitatesHomeSafepost-purchase classes designed to support stability.\n\n\nGeorge Koutsos, a mortgage loan officer withCrossCountry Mortgage, counsels clients to keep three months of mortgage payments on hand for emergencies (and ideally, six). Staying in touch with lenders can alert owners to future drops in interest rates. For long-term security, consider establishing a trust, and it\u2019s never too early to draft a will, said Koutsos.\n\nUnderstanding which public resources may help in the early days can ease startup costs, said Jin Min Lee, homeownership and counseling program manager for theAllston Brighton Community Development Corporation. Lee was a home buyer education student in that program before taking on her management role.\n\nIn the early days of home ownership, self-advocacy is key, said Lee.\n\n\u201cI do feel like there\u2019s this kind of posture of\u2026 curiosity and humility and persistence that\u2019s required through the purchase process and also your first year,\u201d said Lee. \u201cBecause most of us just don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know \u2026 It\u2019s okay to ask questions, it\u2019s okay to really be persistent, and where there\u2019s one closed door, I\u2019m gonna find another door that\u2019s open.\u201d\n\nScheduling aMass Save home energy auditis one example of a great early resource, said Lee, as is applying for resident tax rates for the new address, which can save hundreds if not thousands of dollars.\n\nNew homeowners can be attractive targets for sales pitches, and knowing how to navigate them will help.\n\n\u201cI think everybody who buys a home is going to quickly get started getting solicited,\u201d said Schmiedl.\n\nInstead of rushing into potentially costly improvement projects, slow down.\n\n\u201cLive in it for a year,\u201d said Schmiedl.\n\n\nRushing design changes can interfere with function before owners get a chance to live in the home.\n\nAllison Tilly Carswell and Andrea Canty, ofRed Door Design + Staging, suggested pausing before rushing toward trendy upgrades, such as recessed lighting and open floor plans. Recessed lighting is really best used to illuminate the path in hallways, or to light a kitchen work area. Lamps are more configurable elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve walked into a space and said something like, \u2018You might enjoy your home more if there [was] a wall here separating the entryway from your living room,\u2019 and the homeowners say, \u2018Oh, we took that wall down,\u2018\u201d said Carswell.\n\nTo figure out a design that fits your lifestyle, prioritize heavily used rooms first, said Canty. And paint can go a long way to refresh previous renovations that may not match your tastes, such as on cabinetry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and fill the house right away,\u201d saidRobin Gannon, a Lexington-based designer with national clientele. Live with what you have in order to help you assess the flow and use of a space before investing in higher-quality pieces. In week one, that won\u2019t be clear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re buying somebody else\u2019s taste,\u201d said Gannon.\n\nSpend some time reflecting on your own style, she said. A few quality placeholders can help along the way, such asSisal rugsto unify a room. Try a bold wall color. And in a year, you can always repaint.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to your friends \u2014 listen to your gut,\u201d said Gannon.\n\nSocial media and AI design schemes can intrude on taste. Algorithmic churn can be self-reinforcing, as it spits out more examples like what you\u2019ve already looked for, said Gannon.\n\n\u201cI always say, you can like something but not necessarily want to live with it,\u201d she said.\n\nTo break that cycle, Gannon suggested cross-referencing magazines and different manufacturers rather than following a social media rabbit hole.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed in the first year of homeownership.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in this house that\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d said Santiago, who said he has made an effort to do his own repairs when possible, saving hundreds on smaller projects. He was quickly able to swap out the smoke detectors and manage the ants himself.\n\n\u201cIf you break it down and do one thing at a time, it\u2019s very manageable,\u201d he said.\n\nSantiago paid $656,500 for the three-story, two-family home with town house-style units (front and back), which he said helped qualify for the loan. A first-generation homeowner in his family, he saw gaps in home buyer education, which he said didn\u2019t address post-move issues. Santiago has since acquired his own real estate license with the hope of providing a different experience for others.\n\nEstablishing a home in the first year can mean more than new boilers and bathroom renovations.\n\n\u201cHome is a home, but it\u2019s part of [a] community as well,\u201d said Schmiedl. \u201cA lot of good can come from that.\u201d\n\nAs Santiago began work on his home\u2019s exterior, he discovered several bottles and silverware items dating back to the 1850s. But the project turned up more than artifacts.\n\n\u201cFrom all the hours and hours and hours of work\u2026 I met all of our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s gonna be on the other side. \u201cMaybe you meet somebody new, or maybe you find a cool bottle.\u201d\n\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen Jayne O\u2019Brien lost her husband Bill suddenly in March 2024, she faced two difficult challenges. While dealing with shock and grief, she also wondered where she would live. The couple had been living in Bill\u2019s home in Eastham during their five-year marriage, but after his death, his daughter inherited the house.\n\nO\u2019Brien, 71, still owned a home in nearby Brewster, which she\u2019d been renting to her son and his girlfriend. Her son promptly offered to move out, but O\u2019Brien declined.\n\nA friend put O\u2019Brien in touch with a Maine-based company calledBackyard ADUs, which builds accessory dwelling units. Defined as a secondary residential living space located on the same lot as a single-family home, an ADU can be a freestanding structure or a unit attached to the primary home. They\u2019ve caught on as an affordable way to address housing shortages in states from California to Maine. O\u2019Brien\u2019s son was immediately on board with building one.\n\n\n\u201cWe talked a lot about how to do this and still preserve independence and privacy for both of us,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nADUs are poised for expansion on Cape Cod: TheAffordable Homes Act, which went into effect on Feb. 2, now requires municipalities to permit the building of ADUs in single-family zoning districts throughout Massachusetts, relieving a range of zoning challenges that prevented people from building ADUs across the state.\n\nADU growth will be especially beneficial in places like the Cape, where the cost of housing \u2014 and renovating \u2014 is prohibitively expensive. The annual median sales price of a single-family home in Barnstable County increased from $433,000 in 2019 to $730,000 in 2023, according to theCape Cod Commission, an organization that works to address the region\u2019s housing crisis and develop innovative land use policies.\n\n\u201cAccessory dwelling units are one of the many tools that we can employ to develop more affordable housing options,\u201d explained Kristy Senatori, executive director of the commission. \u201cThey\u2019re not a panacea, but it is relatively easy to add units or density to an existing neighborhood through the use of ADUs while maintaining the architectural character of the area. Certainly that\u2019s critical to Cape Cod\u2019s identity and our economy on the Cape.\u201d\n\nIn addition to serving as homes for aging relatives, ADUs also can support the Cape\u2019s year-round population by providing a source of rental income.\n\n\u201cOur clients are definitely interested in it, both buyers and sellers,\u201d said Katie Clancy, sales vice president atWilliam Raveis Real Estate in Yarmouth Port. \u201cLenders are seizing the opportunity, too, by letting borrowers use potential ADU income count in the mortgage apps.\u201d\n\nTim O\u2019Reilly, director of preconstruction for Backyard ADUs, says the majority of their business is building 500 to-1,200 square-foot homes for multigenerational living.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re often designing with an aging in place lens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had folks who said \u2018Hey, I built this for my adult son with disabilities, or for my mom.\u2019 Or \u2018Hey, I could rent this out for several years and pay down my costs, then move my family in.\u2018\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly emphasized the range of success stories. \u201cIt\u2019s about having that flexibility \u2014 it\u2019s in my backyard, and now I can do what makes the most sense,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, O\u2019Brien is a few weeks out from moving into a 642-square-foot abode in her backyard. As a self-described outdoors person, she isn\u2019t concerned about the limited living space, as she relishes her large deck, outdoor shower, and sizable yard for gardening.\n\n\u201cI do feel like [my son] and I are the poster family for the necessity and benefits of zoning that allows for ADUs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an affordable option and one that will enhance my property now and in the future.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Watch out, Florida \u2014 there could be a new Sunshine State in town.\nIn the sun-scorched expanse of Arizona, a former farming outpost 22 miles southeast of Phoenix is quietly redefining itself as a Southwestern rival to Florida\u2019s seasonal allure, according toMansion Global.\nGilbert, a sprawling suburb of 72 square miles with a population topping 275,000, has shed its agrarian past \u2014 once dominated by dairy cows and hayfields \u2014 to emerge as a magnet for snowbirds.\nWith housing costs that undercut its glitzier neighbor Scottsdale and a climate delivering 300 days of sunshine annually, Gilbert is carving out a niche as the \u201cnew Florida\u201d of the Southwest, blending affordability with a lifestyle that echoes the Sunshine State\u2019s appeal.\nThe numbers tell part of the story.\nGilbert\u2019s median home price hovers at $550,000, a bargain compared to Scottsdale\u2019s $892,000, though luxury estates can climb as high as $25 million.\nEntry-level townhomes start at $300,000, while single-family homes typically exceed $400,000.\nMichael Steck, a Scottsdale-based agent with RETSY, sees the value proposition driving the shift.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely now becoming more of a target for snowbirds because of what you can get for the dollar,\u201d he told Mansion Global.\nLike Florida, Gilbert offers winter temperatures that rarely dip below the 40s, though summers sizzle at an average high of 97. Rainfall, a scant 9 inches annually, leaves room for the kind of outdoor living snowbirds crave \u2014 golf courses, walking trails, and soon, a 25-acre Cactus Surf Park set to open in September.\nBeyond the weather, Gilbert\u2019s transformation mirrors Florida\u2019s evolution from sleepy backwater to retiree paradise.\nIts agricultural heritage has left behind richer soil and more greenery than the surrounding desert, a visual respite akin to Florida\u2019s coastal landscapes.\nUpscale enclaves like West Lake Estates, with waterfront homes fetching millions, cater to second-home buyers, while neighborhoods like Agritopia and Morrison Ranch offer modern twists on farm-style architecture, diverging from the Southwest\u2019s usual adobe aesthetic.\nAdd in outdoor malls like SanTan Village, a burgeoning downtown with historic buildings turned trendy eateries, and recreational hubs like Gilbert Regional Park, the parallels to Florida\u2019s lifestyle grow sharper.\nYet Gilbert\u2019s rise hasn\u2019t been without turbulence.\nThe shadow of the Gilbert Goons, a gang tied to the 2023 killing of 16-year-old Preston Lord and designated a criminal outfit in 2024, briefly tarnished its image.\nStill, local real estate veteran Kirsten Horchler, who grew up in Gilbert and now works with Compass, brushes off the episode as an anomaly.\n\u201cTo classify it as the new Scottsdale or a mini Scottsdale is completely accurate,\u201d she toldDaily Mail, signaling the town\u2019s broader appeal. While she notes Scottsdale remains a snowbird favorite, Gilbert is catching up, with flagship restaurants from Phoenix and Scottsdale opening outposts there.\nEconomically, Gilbert bolsters its case with a robust job market in tech, renewable energy and manufacturing, bolstered by proximity to Phoenix.\nThe cost of living exceeds state and national averages, but residents argue the trade-off \u2014 top schools, parks and a family-friendly vibe \u2014 justifies it.\nHorchler emphasizes the draw for younger transplants, particularly Californians: \u201cIn my experience, it\u2019s been families, young families, families with multiple children.\u201d\nAs developable land dwindles, values are poised to surge, a dynamic Jon Cooper of Cooper Premier Properties LLC underscored to Mansion Global: \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much out of land.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping\u00a0new tariffson imported goods from 60 countries plunged the global stock markets into a state of turmoil, sparking\u00a0recession fears\u2014but the controversial trade policy could up end up being an unexpected boon for the luxury real estate market.\nNot\u00a0surprisingly,stock market performancehas an outsized impact on high-end-home buyers, who are more likely to invest in stocks than their less wealthy counterparts.\nAs of April 6, the S&P 500 had tumbled by 15% since Trump\u2019s inauguration in late January, according toCNN, amid a growing economic uncertainty. In the wake of his tariff rollout on April 2, which the president touted as \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d stock markets around the world suffered\u00a0an estimated loss of about $10 trillion in market value.\nDays of up-and-down trading followed, as China retaliated against the U.S. with 84% tariffs. On April 9, the European Union approved new levies of its own on $23 billion in U.S.-made products, according toReuters.\nTrump then responded bypausing all the new tariffs for 90 days, with the exception of China, on whom he increased the tariffs to 125%.\nHowever, a potential silver lining to this frenzied market volatility is that it could prompt jittery investors to spurn stocks in favor of pricey real estate, \u201cas they seek the reliability of a tangible asset,\u201d\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0Chief Economist\u00a0Danielle Hale\u00a0predicts in her\u00a02025 Luxury Housing Market Outlook.\n\u201cIn an economic environment riddled with uncertainty, investors are seeking out safe havens. For many, this is found in bonds, but real estate may be an alternative for some,\u201d says Hale. \u201cWhile real estate can lose value, it is a tangible asset that not only provides shelter, it tends to have more stable pricing than stocks.\u201d\nShould Trump make another U-turn and fully implement the tariffs as announced, according to Hale, that could undermine economic growth, diminishing incomes and investment returns, and shrinking homebuyers\u2019 purchasing power.\n\u201cFor now, it looks like a reprieve has been issued for many countries, but as we\u2019ve seen very clearly in the last few weeks, the situation can change, so it\u2019s wise for high-end-home buyers to stay abreast of the news,\u201d Hale notes.\nThe good news for these deep-pocketed house hunters is that the high-end real estate market has plenty of room to grow.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nThe total value of domestic household real estate at the end of 2024 reached the second-highest level ever recorded, according to a\u00a0Realtor.com analysis, totaling a staggering $48.1 trillion, representing a 7% increase from the previous year. Notably, gains in real estate value were largest among the ultrarich.\nEven so, real estate value made up just 18.7% of total assets among the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households, down from just under 20% two years prior.\nMeanwhile, corporate equities, which include futures and other financial instruments, as well as mutual fund shares, comprised more than a third of their assets, the highest share ever recorded.\nSimply put, real estate made up a smaller portion of the average portfolios of the affluent set late last year, signaling that there is a lot of growth potential in the high-end housing market.\n\u201cThe combination of significant stock market wealth and relatively low debt in real estate among the wealthiest 10% suggests that this cohort has more capacity for real estate investment,\u201d says Hale.\nThe Realtor.com economist warns that real estate has its own set of issues, namely, property taxes and insurance costs, as well as maintenance and upkeep.\n\u201cStill, real estate can be a place to park money, and when the world feels uncertain, we often see an interest in home and real estate purchases,\u201d Hale adds.\nThe appeal of the U.S. luxury housing market is not lost on moneyed Russians, who reportedly have resumed buying eye-wateringly expensive properties in New York City after a 10-year hiatus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had five Russians look at properties in the $10 million to $20 million range in the past few weeks\u2014condos and town houses,\u201d a New York broker was quoted as telling the outletAir Mail.\nThe shift, according to the unnamed broker, comes down to Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian\u00a0President\u00a0Vladimir Putin, whom he previously praised as a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201csavvy,\u201d before souring on the Kremlin strongman over his intransigence in theproposed peace deal with Ukraine.\nBut the cooling relations between the two world leaders apparently have done nothing to diminish wealthy Russians\u2019 homeownership ambitions on U.S. soil.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t afraid to buy anymore,\u201d the broker told the outlet about the incoming Eastern European investors.\nThe reason for that is that the Trump administration appears to be more welcoming to Russian oligarchs than its Democratic predecessor. Although sanctions against Putin\u2019s government and Russian companies are still in effect, the current Justice Department has done away with units that investigated misbegotten money invested in real estate and yachts.\nA Douglas Elliman broker told Air Mail that her Russian clients currently living in Monaco are looking forward to buying real estate in the U.S. because they value American education and high-quality new construction.\nData from theNational Association of Realtors\u00aesuggests that the $1 million-plus category of homes has been the fastest-growing sales share for 21 consecutive months, and now makes up 7.6% of recent home sales.\nThe reason for that is that affluent homebuyers more often have a lot of existing equity and do not have to rely on mortgage financing, and, therefore, they are not deterred by the high rates.\nHowever, the number of for-sale homes priced above $1 million shrank, amounting to an average of 12.8% of all listings year to date in 2025. For comparison, in 2024 that share was 13.6%.\nTime on the market for high-end listings shimmied down from 76 days to 75, even as homes priced below $1 million remained unsold for 64 days, up from 58 the year before.\nOn top of that, price cuts have ticked up from 20.8% to 22.6% among homes with an asking price below $1 million, but remained roughly flat among luxury properties.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Despite a flood of new rentals and longer listing times in March, New Yorkers continued to duke it out for apartments at near-record prices.\nRental market activity swelled across New York City last month. High prices and minimal vacancy rates stubbornly persisted, despite higher inventory, anew reportby Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel revealed.\nManhattan rents remained at record highs, Brooklyn bidding wars persisted and Queens lease signings surged.\nMahmoud Ammar, a critical care pharmacist, learned the hard way how difficult it has become to find the right apartment for the right price.\nAmmar, who works from home, had a lease with a roommate ending on April 1. He began his hunt for his very own one-bedroom in late February.\nAmmar and his agent, Tim Cass of Corcoran, spent multiple weekends touring two to three apartments per day, plus some tours scattered through the work week. Ammar had a budget of $3,000 to $3,500 and the desire to live solo in Midtown West.\nBut he kept losing out on the good ones, affordable one-bedrooms became a pipe dream and nearly every landlord wanted immediate occupancy.\n\u201cIt became stressful because I knew I\u2019d be moving out in three weeks, and I still didn\u2019t have an apartment,\u201d Ammar told The Post.\nAt $4,471, Manhattan\u2019s median effective rent \u2014 which factors in landlord discounts and concessions \u2014 tied for the highest on record, up annually for the sixth time. Despite pricing pain, new lease signings rose in March, a month not typically known for its rental activity. The data signals a difficult rest of the year for hopeful renters.\n\u201cTypically you look at the beginning of a month for the start of the following month, but in this environment, you have to take it as soon as you see it,\u201d Cass said. \u201cWe missed out on several properties because Mahmoud hesitated.\u201d\nCass said historically the market heats up around Mother\u2019s Day in May. That\u2019s not the case anymore.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening much, much earlier now, as we experienced,\u201d Cass said. \u201cMarch was a very popular month for renters.\u201d\nInventory just met demand in March, the Elliman report found, getting absorbed as fast as it arrived. Vacancy rates in Manhattan barely budged, but listing inventory increased year-over-year by 23.1%.\nDespite intense demand, days on the market increased from 57 days inred-hot Februaryto 42 in March, suggesting some modest degree of cooling.\nBut as Cass and Ammar learned, not all inventory is created equal. Cass described going with Ammar to an apartment on West 57th Street that \u201csounded too good to be true.\u201d\nA line of a dozen people had already formed outside.\n\u201cWhen we finally got inside, the tenant was still sitting in the apartment, and we noticed there were mouse traps,\u201d Cass said. \u201cThere was a reason that it was priced so reasonably for a one-bedroom in that neighborhood. We couldn\u2019t wait to get out.\u201d\nMedian Manhattan rents in March decreased by $5 from February, down to $4,495. But last month\u2019s net-effective rent tied with February for the highest on record, at $4,471, indicating that renters are getting less grace from landlords.\u00a0Rates of landlord concessions and listing discounts fell in Manhattan.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hesitate in this market,\u201d Cass said. \u201cYou have to act quickly. If you snooze, you lose.\u201d\nAverage rental price per square foot also rose to a new high in Brooklyn for the third straight month, and Queens saw an eighteenth annual increase in lease signings.\nThe incidence of bidding wars across the three boroughs declined slightly from February, but the rates remain historically high, particularly in Kings County.\nOne in three new Brooklyn renters paid more than the landlord asked. One out of five rentals in Manhattan and Northwest Queens \u2014 which is home to Astoria \u2014 went for above the listing price.\nThe past several months of heavy competition doesn\u2019t bode well for a rental market beset by economic uncertainty.\n\u201cA lot of buyers are having difficulty at the moment, because of interest rates,\u201d Cass said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t buy something, they\u2019re getting into the rental market. I think that is increasing the demand.\u201d\nThankfully, Ammar\u2019s story has a happy ending. He settled on an alcove loft apartment in the heart of Midtown West at $3,400 plus full fees. The place came with a doorman, an elevator and big windows.\n\u201cEighth Avenue in the afternoon brings a lot of sunshine in, and with plants and flowers, it just makes it feel really nice,\u201d Ammar said. \u201cAnd those big windows make a big difference, especially since I work from home. I love the location.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Ninth St. in the East Village, is now slated for residential redevelopment.\nWhat the Henicks intend to do with their two Ann Street parcels \u2014 located between Nassau and William streets in the Financial District \u2014 remains uncertain. No additional construction applications have surfaced in city records.\nThe Post has reached out to Jeffrey Henick for comment.\nThe fallout from the 2023 collapse has also disrupted lives beyond the immediate vicinity.\nA family of five residing at a 12-unit residential Ann Street building nearby, foundtheir lives upendedafter being displaced indefinitely.\nThe Cohen family, as The Post reported in 2024, relocated to a house with a wraparound porch in Westfield, N.J.

        "content": "By Regina Cole, The Boston Globe\n\n\nFor many years a center of the paper industry, Millinocket struggled to rebuild its economy after theGreat Northern Paper Companyclosed in 2008. Today, Millinocket is up and coming as a four-season tourist attraction. The gateway to Mount Katahdin, Maine\u2019s highest mountain, Moosehead Lake, and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, the town exemplifies Vacationland. As Laura Blake of Legacy Properties in Damariscotta put it, \u201cWe are so very lucky to live in Maine and enjoy its four seasons.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to vacation in the Bay State, there are areas less crowded and less expensive than the Cape, the North Shore, and the Berkshires, but that still have scenic areas near recreation. One of these is East Longmeadow, situated in the Pioneer Valley between Springfield and the towns of northern Connecticut. East Longmeadow was once a center of red and brown sandstone quarrying: the stone making up the original building of Washington\u2019s Smithsonian Institution museum is from here. TheElijah Burt House, built between 1720 and 1740, is worth a visit. It is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the town, and a station on the Underground Railroad.\n\n\nNew Hampshire real estate prices have been rising, but the occasional quality home for under $400,000 still exists. An area to search is Center Barnstead, a community in the town of Barnstead and the largest of several villages in the town. It is close to the Lakes Region, which has convenient access to the hundreds of lakes south of the White Mountains. There you will find ski areas, art galleries, beaches, restaurants, ice cream shops, and all the other destinations vacationers seek, but with rural tranquility and scenic beauty.\n\n\n\nFor good reason, the coast of Maine is a magnet for vacationers. With its countless harbors, coves, headlands, beaches, and islands, it is unparalleled for scenic beauty, fresh air, and fresh lobster. But, as with any desirable area, it is pricey, with houses in coastal towns fetching far more than inland real estate.\n\nThis changes as you leave behind the crowds of the mid-coast and head Down East to Washington County. At the end of the road, at the Canadian border, is Eastport. With just a little over 1,000 people, it is the least-populous city in Maine, but also one of its most historic: Eastport celebrated its bicentennial in 1998.\n\nIt is one of the most festival-minded communities in Maine. Navy ships have docked here during the Fourth of July celebration for many years. Every September, the city hosts the annual Maine Salmon Festival in the historic downtown district, and, for 20 years, there has been a Pirate Festival the weekend after Labor Day.\n\n\nVermont has maple syrup, great cheese, legendary ski mountains, picture-perfect villages, and cows grazing on hillsides unspoiled by billboards or strip malls. In the southern part of the state, between Mount Snow and Stratton Mountain in theGreen Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forest, is Wardsboro.\n\nThis small town encompasses five villages, one of which literally has the name Podunk. Wardsboro has scenic beauty and recreational opportunities \u2014 Somerset Reservoir and Grout Pond are minutes from Main Street, and the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers Snowmobile trails run through the town \u2014 but none of the crowds and condos of nearby ski areas.\n\n\nHunters, hikers, nature lovers, and those who simply want to get away from it all head to the pine-scented peace of Maine\u2019s western mountains. Eustis, which includes the village of Stratton, is located about halfway betweenSugarloaf Mountainand the Canadian border. It is on the Dead River,which provided transportation for Benedict Arnold and his troops in 1775, when they made their way to fight in the ill-fated Battle of Quebec. Later, the river was known for log drives, which involved floating wood down the river to mills, a deadly practice that was banned in 1976. Now the Dead River is a popular destination for white-water rafting.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Kara Baskin, The Boston Globe\n\nFor decades, people have bought property with a partner or their biological family members. But amid a skyrocketing housing market and loneliness becoming a public health epidemic, aspiring buyers are looking beyond the traditional nuclear family to find new financial and social solutions to homeownership.\n\nAt the end of April, Harvard Law School plans to release a landmark guidebook called \u201cHow to Buy Property with Chosen Family,\u201d which addresses how to approach traditional institutions such as banks and real estate agencies as a nontraditional unit. The first-of-its-kind primer, which will be published by the school\u2019sLGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic, is for people trying to buy a home with friends or anyone hoping to live in a nonstandard structure.\n\nThe arrangement is often associated with polyamory,but the clinic emphasizes that the guide can apply to a group of friends, multiple families, or anybody who wants to break into the housing market but doesn\u2019t have the desire or resources to go it alone. The guide offers strategies such as creating a tenancy in common agreement or an LLC, which offers ownership agreements and stipulates financial consequences in case a living arrangement goes south.\n\n\u201cAmong a lot of people I know, this is the main way that they see themselves being able to [buy] \u2014 and it also seems like a much better idea than becoming isolated in your own little suburban enclave without access to community,\u201d saidSamara Trilling, a third-year Harvard Law student who coauthored the guidebook in collaboration with thePolyamory Legal Advocacy Coalition(PLAC).\n\nThe guide comes at the right time, Trilling said, as more people simply crave community and homeownership. The structure \u2014 romantic or platonic \u2014 makes financial sense, and the guide\u2019srelease coincides with a shift in household demographics. As of 2025, an estimated61 million Americans (nearly 20 percent of the population)co-own a home with someone who isn\u2019t their spouse, according to a new survey by CoBuy, an end-to-end platform to simplify nontraditional home buying.\n\n\u201cMany people are not in a nuclear family. That is just not the state of American families anymore. \u2026 And cities are sort of having to grapple with: Wait a second. If that\u2019s not actually reflecting our constituents, how do we build in pathways toward generational wealth that actually can meet people where they\u2019re at?\u201d said Kimberly Rhoten, a PLAC cofounder.\n\nSomerville is a groundbreaking example.In 2020, spurred by COVID and the desire for all people to easily visit loved ones in the hospital,the City Council passed an ordinancerecognizing domestic partnerships, including polyamorous relationships. Somerville again made news in 2023 when the City Council approved a unique anti-discrimination ordinance to protect people in polyamorous and other consensually nonmonogamous relationships. The ordinance prohibits discrimination in employment and policing against those in relationships of two or more people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from people who moved to our community specifically because of these [2023] laws and because of the domestic partnership ordinance that passed in 2020,\u201d said Willie Burnley Jr., a Somerville city councilor-at-large and mayoral candidate who is polyamorous and rents his home with platonic roommates.\n\n\nPLAC has done similar work in Cambridge, and the progress has been logistically helpful to home buyers \u2014 but also symbolic to people who often feel stigmatized due to lifestyle choices, proponents said.\n\nHeath Schechinger, another PLAC cofounder and executive director of the nationwideModern Family Institute, enjoyed lower utility costs and a bigger home than he would have otherwise afforded while living with two other couples. Of course, the arrangement wasn\u2019t perfect.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have this unilateral capacity to make decisions on my own or that I thought would be best,\u201d Schechinger said. \u201cAlso, there was some social stigma.\u201d\n\nBut the benefits were worth it, and Schechinger is hopeful that laws and housing models will catch up to prospective homeowners\u2019 financial and social realities.\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of people are living with their chosen family: buying homes with friends or partners, or building family through shared values rather than marriage. The future of family isn\u2019t about form. It\u2019s about function \u2014 and who you build your life with.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "A striking piece of Hamptons architectural history is coming on the market.\nA one-of-a-kind, 141-year-old summer cottage in Water Mill is going up for sale,the Wall Street Journal reported. The lodge was built in 1884 by a clergyman named Rev. Henry Turbell Rose. Rose paid his uncle $50 for half an acre of Water Mill farmland and $25 for a house design.\nFast forward centuries, a time in which the Hamptons because a playground for the rich and famous, and the reverend could not have imagined that his quaint summer cottage would one day go on the market for $14.25 million.\nThe home is named Rosemary Lodge \u2014 a combination of Rose\u2019s last name and that of his wife, Mary.\nThe late Victorian house wasadded to the National Register of Historic Placesin 2000, in which it was described as \u201ca highly intact example of the Shingle Style\u201d and praised for Rose\u2019s exceptional workmanship.\nThe home spans a little over 4,100 square feet and two-and-a-half stories. It boasts a large porch, a steep gabled roof and shingle exteriors with red trim. Each room is clad in a different type of wood, the Journal reported.\nElaborate interior woodwork, crafted by Rose and inspired by the English Tudor period, features floral motifs and even carved inscriptions of Shakespeare, according to the Register.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so different from going to these new houses, where everything is white and it\u2019s all glass windows,\u201d listing agent Steven Dorn of Brown Harris Stevens told The Journal.\nRosemary Lodge last changed hands in 2005, according to Suffolk County records, for $2.57 million.\nRecent restorations remained faithful to the home\u2019s old-world details, the Journal reported, but not the home\u2019s old footprint. According to the National Register, Rosemary Lodge was moved nearly half a mile south in 1985. A pool and a pool house were added after the move.\nThe current owners renovated the kitchen and bathrooms, the Journal reported, as well as built a screened-in porch. The owners are generously including 50 pieces of original furniture and cabinetry, as well, all built by Rose.\nAdvertisement",

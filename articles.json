        "content": "The stately brick homes on Beacon Hill aren\u2019t the only real estate that\u2019s selling for a premium fee.A single parking spot in a garage on Brimmer Street is on the market for $750,000, according to a real estate listing posted last week. It\u2019s just the latest spot to notch a steep price tag in the neighborhood, where it seems the only thing more coveted than housing is parking.\u201cIt\u2019s a great long-term hold,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, a realtor for Cabot & Company and one of the spot\u2019s two listing agents. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be building any more parking on the hill.\u201dThe parking space, first reported on by the Boston Herald, is located in a luxury garage just off Storrow Drive that offers refueling, car washing, and other concierge services, according to the listing.AdvertisementRodriguez said the spot belongs to a family that recently closed a deal to sell their home in the neighborhood. Some potential buyers have shown interest in the space, but it was still \u201cvery much available\u201d as of Thursday, he added.Brimmer Street Garage, which bills itself as Beacon Hill\u2019s \u201cmost exclusive venue to capture a parking space,\u201d operates as a condominium; the spots are sold privately as deeded, taxable pieces of property.When homes are sold on Beacon Hill, the sellers usually include the value of their parking spaces in the overall sale price. Oftentimes, the deeds to the spaces are transferred by a symbolic payment, Rodriguez said.\u201cWhen [sellers] go to record the sale of the house, they also record the sale of the parking because it\u2019s a fully separate deed, and they\u2019ll just record it as $1,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we actually don\u2019t know what the true value was ... for that parking space.\u201dBut when parking spaces come on the market separately, they can fetch well over half a million dollars.\u201cThe owners of this space thought it made more sense to bring it to market and see what the market would bear,\u201d Rodriguez said.In 1979, single parking spaces at the Brimmer were being sold for $7,500, or roughly $35,000 in today\u2019s money, according to the garage\u2019s website.AdvertisementLast year, the most expensive parking spot in the garage sold for $565,000, Rodriguez said.It\u2019s rare for a parking space at a \u201cfull service\u201d garage like the Brimmer to come on the market, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re spending $5 million, $10 million, $20 million for a house on the Hill and you don\u2019t have any parking \u2014 at that point, for purchasing a spot, it becomes splitting hairs whether you pay $500,000 or $600,[000] or $700,000,\u201d he said.Camilo Fonseca can be reached at camilo.fonseca@globe.com.

        "content": "In the latest test for Boston\u2019s beleaguered office market, Rockpoint Group is preparing to put the two interconnected offices at 75-101 Federal St. in downtown Boston on the market in partnership with Wells Fargo, and is tapping brokerage Newmark to market the buildings for sale in the coming weeks, The Boston Globe has learned.Three real estate industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the pending listing. Rockpoint and Wells Fargo both declined to comment, while a representative for Newmark did not respond.The complex spans about 853,000 square feet and is about 71 percent occupied, according to data from real estate firm CoStar Group.Related: One of Boston\u2019s skyline-defining towers is on the auction block \u2014 and expected to sell at a big discountThe pending sale comes amid a broad price reset for Boston\u2019s office market, with a growing roster of towers going up for sale for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shook up demand for office space. Real estate experts expect downtown properties could be worth between 40 percent and 60 percent less than they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and several recent sales bear out that thesis.Rockpoint Group has owned 75-101 Federal, at least in part, since 2015, when it purchased the conjoined offices for $326.5 million. Rockpoint sold a 50 percent stake in the buildings to Carr Properties in March 2020 \u2014 the very same week COVID was declared a national emergency \u2014 for about $185 more per square foot than it had paid five years previously. (Carr sold its stake back to Rockpoint last year for an undisclosed price). Also that week, Rockpoint and Carr finalized a $292 million mortgage with Wells Fargo, according to Suffolk County records, a mortgage with a maturity date of March 12, 2025.AdvertisementThe 75-101 Federal St. buildings have entrances on both Federal and Devonshire streets in downtown Boston. Here, one of the towers is reflected in the facade of 100 Federal St. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe brick and stone 75 Federal St. building dates to 1929 and was once described by the Boston Landmarks Commission as \u201cthe most elaborately decorative Art Deco skyscraper standing in Boston.\u201d The 31-story tower at 101 Federal St. was built as an adjoining office in 1988. The towers are connected by a block-long lobby linking their two entrances \u2014 one on Federal Street, the other on Devonshire Street \u2014 that was renovated in 2016.AdvertisementTwo real estate industry sources said Rockpoint and Wells Fargo are working closely on the sale and collectively decided to bring Newmark\u2019s capital markets team in to market the property. The 262,000-square-foot 75 Federal St. is 78 percent occupied, while the 591,000-square-foot 101 Federal St. is 64 percent occupied, according to CoStar.Related: Take a look at the first skyscraper proposed in downtown Boston since the pandemicIt\u2019s not clear for how much the towers could sell. Several recent deals have seen properties trade at big discounts, with significant implications for both the city\u2019s tax base and their owners\u2019 balance sheets.For example, after purchasing 179 Lincoln St. near South Station in January 2020 for $155.7 million, a Blackstone entity sold the five-story building to Boston\u2019s Synergy Investments last March for $76.5 million \u2014 a 51 percent price decline, according to research from Avison Young. Also last March, Synergy purchased 101 Arch St. in Downtown Crossing for $78 million \u2014 some 36 percent less than it sold for in 2005, and some $11 million less than the property had sold for in 2002.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "For the last six years, Annie Gordon has not gone a day without worrying about facing eviction or a huge rent increase.Now, she can relax.Developer Related Beal, with financial backing from the City of Boston, is buying the 347-unit Mattapan apartment complex where Gordon has lived for nearly 50 years and setting rents at affordable rates, putting an end to a lengthy saga that saw fixed-income tenants battle with a landlord that bought the property in 2018 and raised rents dramatically.\u201cThe feeling is overwhelming relief,\u201d said Gordon, who is 74. \u201cWhen I got the call with the news, I couldn\u2019t even believe it because we\u2019ve been fighting, trying to stay in our homes for so long. There\u2019s still a part of me that can\u2019t believe it. We fought so hard, and we actually won.\u201dAdvertisementSome tenants wept when they heard the news, Gordon said.\u201cThe toll this took on all of us,\u201d she said, \u201cwas huge.\u201dThe city is contributing more than $10 million to the purchase to guarantee affordable rents for all of the units, as well as protections against big rent increases, officials said at a press conference at Fairlawn Estates, as the property was known before it was purchased in 2018. Half of the units will be set at rents affordable to tenants making 60 percent of the area median income, or $78,360 for a household of two, and the other half will be set at 80 percent AMI. Related\u2019s deal with the city also caps annual rent increases at 2 percent a year.Related\u2019s affiliate, Related Affordable, would not say how much they are spending to purchase the 12-building property, but DSF Group paid $65 million to buy it in 2018.Boston\u2019s $10 million contribution is coming through its Acquisition Opportunity Program, which provides funding to community and housing groups to finance the purchase of market-rate housing to be maintained as permanently affordable. The groups behind the transactions can borrow against the city\u2019s contribution to obtain additional capital. In this case, the city said it was able to secure nine times its $10 million investment in private funds.At 347 units, Related\u2019s purchase of the Mattapan property is by far the largest such acquisition under the AOP. In 2022, the city helped finance the purchase of 36 small apartment buildings totaling 114 apartments in East Boston for affordable housing.Related: Leader of Mattapan tenant organization staves off eviction ... for nowAdvertisementThe program is part of a broader strategy by Mayor Michelle Wu that has seen the city pour hundreds of millions of pandemic recovery dollars into the construction and acquisition of affordable housing. By purchasing market-rate homes, the city can avoid the prohibitive costs it takes to build new affordable housing, while maintaining buildings in neighborhoods that are gentrifying rapidly.\u201cThe City of Boston is so proud to play a role in restoring Fairlawn as an affordable home, because for decades, these units were known that way: an affordable place to raise a family,\u201d Wu said Monday. \u201cOver the last few years especially, the rent here was hiked up ... and families were forced out of Fairlawn, out of Mattapan, and out of the city.\u201dNow, \u201cit\u2019s a new day,\u201d said city housing chief Sheila Dillon.Fairlawn was built in the 1960s off Mattapan\u2019s Bismarck Street, and it eventually became a community cornerstone because its cheap rents supported a community of longtime tenants, some of whom live on fixed incomes.Annie Gordon in her Mattapan apartment in June 2020.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffA few of those tenants spent years advocating for the addition of the Mattapan commuter rail stop, but when it was finally built, the apartment complex became attractive for prospective investors, Gordon said.That\u2019s when DSF bought the place. Rents immediately rose, in some cases, by hundreds of dollars. Many tenants couldn\u2019t afford the increases. Some left, but others stayed and fought, refusing to pay the increases and forming a tenant association with the help of tenant group City Life/Vida Urbana.Related: From 2022: In East Boston, a big move to keep renters in their homesAdvertisementLast year, DSF moved to evict Gordon, but a judge sided with her and let her stay.\u201cTenants have been traumatized by this,\u201d said Gabrielle Rene, the Mattapan community organizer for City Life. \u201cThis has been years of pain and struggle.\u201dThe saga at Fairlawn Estates highlights how vulnerable many residents of the city are to big rent increases, and why policy makers should prioritize protections for renters, said Gordon. People like Gordon would benefit directly from something like rent control, she said. And the city should also pass the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would require landlords to give tenants and housing groups the opportunity to purchase apartment buildings before they go up for sale on the private market, she said.Related\u2019s purchase is a rare victory for tenants in a city where apartment buildings change hands and rents soar frequently. Many of those sales have much different endings.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cI\u2019m grateful I get to stay in my home.\u201dResidents and advocates gave a round of applause during the announcement Monday.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The town of Middleborough sued Governor Maura Healey and the state housing office Friday, seeking an exemption from the controversial MBTA Communities Act, which requires cities and towns served by the T to make it easier to build multifamily housing within their borders.The lawsuit asks for a waiver from the law\u2019s zoning requirements under a recent opinion from State Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who called the law an \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d because, she said, the Legislature did not designate adequate funds for its implementation.Related: More controversy erupts after state auditor says Mass. housing law is an \u2018unfunded mandate\u2019Middleborough, the town said in the lawsuit, has already built housing near its commuter rail station in recent years, and should not be forced to make room for more. Adhering to the law\u2019s requirements would be a \u201csignificant expense\u201d because the town does not have the infrastructure to accommodate more development, it said. Lawyers for the town added that the state has gone too far in punishing towns it deems noncompliant, carrying out a \u201ccampaign of threats, intimidation, and coercion.\u201dMiddleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law\u2019s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.AdvertisementThe town wrote to DiZoglio\u2019s office last year requesting her to weigh in on the law, and when Middleborough officials received her opinion last week calling it an unfunded mandate, they moved quickly to prepare a lawsuit.For the Healey administration, this is yet another roadblock for a law that it inherited from the Legislature but has become central to its housing strategy.The administration set a goal in February of building 222,000 new homes by 2035 in order to head off the housing shortage, which is quickly warping the economic reality of everyday residents. The state is well behind the pace of construction needed to meet that goal, and officials see MBTA Communities \u2014 Massachusetts\u2019 most consequential new housing law in decades \u2014 as key to course correcting. Most of the state\u2019s housing production over the last several decades has happened in Boston and a few neighboring communities. The law is designed to stimulate housing production in the suburbs and towns in Eastern Massachusetts that have long shut out new development.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysAdvertisementBut towns have not taken kindly to the law. Some see it as an affront on Massachusetts' tradition of local government decisions over land-use rules, and many do not want to encourage the production of more homes, particularly apartment buildings.The law requires 177 cities and towns with access to the T create zoning districts that allow for multifamily housing, but it does not mandate building.Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued the town of Milton last year for failing to meet the law\u2019s requirements, and the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law, though it also ruled that the state must put the guidelines that shape its implementation through a formal regulatory process.Campbell, in a statement Friday, said her office will defend the law.\u201cI am grateful to the majority of communities that understand the importance of responsible zoning, and my office and I intend to successfully defend this law in court,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Auditor\u2019s incorrect legal assessment has spurred challenges to a law meant to address our housing crisis.\u201dMiddleborough officials say the town created a multifamily zoning district in 2021 that has since yielded 174 multifamily units, a quarter of which are set at affordable rents. And over the last 20 years, the town has seen 881 housing units built within a mile of its commuter rail station.Related: How will the state\u2019s historic rezoning mandate affect your community?AdvertisementIt argues that should be enough to satisfy the requirements of MBTA Communities. But under the law, the town has to create zoning that makes room for at least 1,471 units. The zoning the town passed in 2021 only allows for 549 units.Lawyers for the town said it has been unfairly punished for not complying with the law\u2019s requirements \u201cthrough the withholding and/or recission of more than $6.5 million in funding for school programs, infrastructure projects, and other initiatives that are necessary to provide the very housing the Act was enacted to create.\u201d Those funding programs are discretionary, and the state has, in some cases, tied towns\u2019 chances of approval to their MBTA Communities compliance status.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new in Middleboro. We recognize the need for more housing near public transit as a function of responsible town planning,\u201d Middleborough Town Manager James McGrail said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our part. We are not anti-housing. The fact that we\u2019re even having to go to court to sort this out is crazy.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.",

Those plans attracted sophisticated investors, including San Francisco-based DivcoWest and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, according to a real estate industry source with knowledge of the deal.\u201cThis is an important moment for our firm and all of our partners,\u201d said Joel Kestenbaum, president of Brooklyn-based Fortis, at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t be prouder to see this deal come to fruition after nearly a year in the making.\u201dNext week, the 503-foot tower will go up for auction \u2014 a move forced by one of Fortis\u2019s unpaid lenders.AdvertisementIt\u2019s a stunning turn of events for a building whose blue glass and gray granite facade has long been one of the most prominent points on Boston\u2019s skyline. For two decades, it was home to State Street Corp., until 2023, when the financial giant decamped for a new tower across town.One Lincoln never recovered, and today \u2014 despite HarbourVest\u2019s arrival \u2014 the building still stands about half empty. There are at least four big loans on the tower, and with little rent coming in, Fortis has struggled to pay down its substantial debt. Now lenders want the money back. In the auction process, a new owner will likely take over the building.The facade at One Lincoln St.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFortis did not respond to a request for comment.While it\u2019s not clear how much One Lincoln will fetch at auction, it\u2019s fair to expect a far lower sum than the $1 billion valuation it commanded in 2022. That\u2019s a reality facing many commercial real estate owners in Boston right now. Five years after COVID upended the city\u2019s office market, a long-delayed reckoning on the value of office towers is coming, with major implications on the city\u2019s tax base and the future of downtown.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s like the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s not a loss until you sell it,\u201d said Dion Sorrentino, associate director of market analytics at CoStar Group in Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hold it for as long as they can.\u201dFor a dozen years after the 2008 financial crisis, commercial real estate prices steadily rose in Boston, generating eye-popping sales numbers and fueling the city\u2019s budget. Rock-bottom interest rates made borrowing easy and cheap. Companies poured into downtown to tap the city\u2019s talented young workforce. By the end of 2019, office vacancy was in the single digits and investors spent more than $8 billion that year alone to snap up commercial real estate that, by all accounts, was going to remain valuable for years to come.Then came the pandemic. Demand for office space plummeted, and today the vacancy rate is 21.1 percent, according to real estate firm Newmark. Meanwhile interest rates skyrocketed. That made it more expensive to borrow money for development projects and to refinance existing debt, particularly loans made at low, pre-COVID, interest rates.A developer has proposed converting 400 Atlantic Ave., a low-lying brick office facing Boston Harbor, into a hotel.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffDowntown landlords could hang on, for a time.While there are abundant smaller owners, many premier buildings in Boston are owned \u2014 in full or in part \u2014 by large real estate firms such as Boston Properties and Tishman Speyer; private equity like Rockpoint Group; or investment arms of pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, such as Oxford Properties and Norges Bank. Their deep pockets bought them time, and lenders offered extensions on repayments for a year or two, said Mark Fallon, director of research and strategy at real estate brokerage Hunneman in Boston.AdvertisementFor years, that \u201cextend and pretend\u201d phenomenon kept Boston\u2019s commercial real estate sales market in relative stasis. Meanwhile owners fished for lucrative new leases to pay down their debt. The prospect of converting office to lab space \u2014 expensive, but with the potential to draw in high-paying life-science companies as tenants \u2014 continued to generate hope for a turnaround.But mostly, local owners have held off on selling for a simple reason, said Jeffrey Havsy of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no forcing mechanism, if the debt wasn\u2019t due.\u201dNow though, those bills are coming due, prompting new momentum in the sales market. For many, the decision to sell will be difficult and costly: Havsy said many downtown buildings could sell for 40 to 60 percent of their pre-COVID price.The trend is one that city officials and financial watchdogs are monitoring closely. Some 71.1 percent of Boston\u2019s $4.6 billion budget is funded by property taxes \u2014 much of it on commercial property \u2014 and price declines could hit that revenue hard. But the change could also lower rents, potentially broadening the number of tenants who can afford space downtown.Related: Corporate signs are proliferating on Boston's skylineA price reset, Havsy said, can also loosen up opportunities for investors with cash and patience, like Norges Bank. In December, an arm of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund paid $248 per square foot for just over half of 33 Arch St., according to research from real estate firm Avison Young. That\u2019s less than half the $606 per square foot that retirement behemoth TIAA paid to buy the 33-story downtown tower in 2011. (Norges bought out the first half of TIAA\u2019s stake in 2013.)Advertisement\u201cIn a period of heightened dislocation in the office sector, we see this as an opportune moment to invest,\u201d said Norges real estate executive Per L\u00f8ken in a statement. Along with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Norges also bought just over half of 501 Boylston St. in Back Bay \u2014 noting its $194.9 million in existing debt \u2014 giving it full control of the building after it bought the first half in 2018.TIAA did not respond to a Globe request for comment.That kind of real estate calculus \u2014 or perhaps musical chairs \u2014 can get tricky fast, leaving a fair amount of uncertainty as to what buildings are actually worth. In the past five years, it\u2019s been tough to discern the pandemic\u2019s impact on office values, and, in turn, municipal tax revenues \u2014 in large part because many owners haven\u2019t had to sell.\u201cWhat is happening now is a reset,\u201d said Jason S. Weissman, founder of Boston Realty Advisors. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing it all over.\u201dMany of the city\u2019s largest taxpayers are commercial landlords. One Lincoln, the tower up for auction in March, owes more than $15 million in net tax to the city this fiscal year. The 32-story office tower at 99 High St., which went up for sale in July, owes $8.6 million in net taxes. The value of those buildings has an outsize impact on city finances, one reason Mayor Michelle Wu last year sought to hike commercial tax rates to keep revenue flowing. That effort stalled in the state Senate, but she is trying again this year.The 32-story office tower at 99 High St. was listed for sale in July 2024.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in downtown property values could represent a mammoth hit to city finances. The Boston Municipal Research Bureau, an independent financial watchdog organization, in November explored how the city could diversify its revenue sources to not be so heavily dependent on property taxes.AdvertisementOf course, not all buildings are selling for a loss. An entity of Qatari investor Ezdan Holding Group paid $99.5 million for the 11-story office at 855 Boylston St. in Back Bay in fall 2023 \u2014 more than double what the property sold for in 2000. And, generally speaking, newer and higher-end buildings have maintained stronger demand from tenants willing to pay top-tier rents.But for buildings with low occupancy, it\u2019s difficult to restructure debt, said Aaron Jodka, the director of US capital markets research for Colliers. That\u2019s opening up avenues for buyers \u2014 family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other private investors \u2014 who are seeing \u201ca generational acquisition opportunity,\u201d Jodka said, and sometimes a chance to try something other than office space.One example: JAJ Investment Group, the Luxembourg-based family office of French financier Jacques Chahine, plans to convert 400 Atlantic Ave. \u2014 a low-lying former law office facing Boston Harbor \u2014 into a hotel. The office was formerly the longtime home of Goulston & Storrs, which moved to nearby One Post Office Square last April.\u201cWhen there is upheaval and change in the market, it does create new opportunities for others,\u201d Jodka said. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s usually the pain the previous owner has to go through.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

He dealt with learning disabilities and lingering effects of malnutrition from his earliest years, then went on to run track in high school and graduate from North Shore Community College.Montanino struggled with alcoholism in his college years \u2014 a problem that led him to living on the streets for nearly two years. He\u2019d bounce back and forth from the Constitution Beach Walk to Jeffries Point, to the library and the flower shop. Sometimes he did food app delivery on foot for $7 an order.\u201cThat was my homeless life, just going from one thing to another ... never really knowing where my next meal was coming from,\u201d he said.AdvertisementThese days, though, Montanino is calling Jamaica Plain home. He\u2019s one of the new residents at 3368 Washington St., a five-story, $105 million residential building celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. Developed by Boston-based The Community Builders and homeless services provider Pine Street Inn, the building \u2014 to be named \u201cThe Lyndia\u201d in honor of Pine Street Inn executive director Lyndia Downie \u2014 is the largest permanent supportive housing development in New England. The 202-unit building includes 140 studios for formerly unhoused people referred by Pine Street in one wing, and 62 affordable units for families in another.The city of Boston provided some $17.3 million to the project, and supported it amid a lengthy lawsuit that challenged its zoning.Related: \u2018Permanent supportive housing\u2019 may be controversial to would-be neighbors, but it\u2019s been beneficial to those who live in it | Shirley Leung\u201cTo solve homelessness, you have to tackle the roots of the problem, which is making sure that people can have a home, and have support in living in their homes,\u201d said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \u201cYou really have to have a plan for homes to be accessible and supportive for everyone.\u201dDownie has long championed permanent supportive housing, which is basically an apartment with social services on site, and Pine Street has gradually grown its inventory of such buildings in recent years. Advocates say tackling the roots of homelessness requires more than just handing out grants, and instead making sure individuals have both a roof over their heads and access to health and wellness support systems to guide them through a world-upending transition. Montanino said he is frequently connected with security and outreach personnel, case managers, a personal landlord, and property managers, all of whom helped him move \u2014 and stay \u2014 off the streets.Advertisement\u201cThey\u2019re all hands on deck here,\u201d he said.Michael Montanino in his new unit at 3368 Washington St.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe 3368 Washington project includes support services like onsite mental health counseling, 24/7 security, and key fob-activated elevators. Residents are directly referred by Pine Street Inn. On a recent tour of the building, fliers for workforce development programs with Pine Street and Roxbury Community College were available for anyone to read.The property was formerly a low-slung warehouse, which Pine Street bought in 1997 and over the years used for a variety of functions, including office space for case workers and a small woodworking program. As Pine Street ramped up its housing development efforts, the site stood out, particularly given its proximity to the Green Street Orange Line station. Most developers responded to Pine Street\u2019s bid for proposals with pitches for around 40 to 60 units, Downie said. But Bart Mitchell, CEO of The Community Builders, aimed higher.\u201cBart and I went over to look at the site, and Bart, even that day, said, \u2018Look, if we can get some height relief, we can do something really sustainable here. We can get some scale,\u2019\u201d Downie said. \u201cThat was what, for us, was so exciting. ... The more long-term people you can move out, the better chance you have of meeting shelter demand.\u201dThe project hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. The landlord of a neighboring property sued in 2020, alleging the zoning process to allow the project was flawed. Though the lawsuit eventually settled, the delay cost \u201cmultiple millions\u201d of dollars, said Andy Waxman, Community Builders\u2019 senior vice president of real estate.AdvertisementPine Street and The Community Builders are collaborating on similar projects, including 900 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester, which is under construction now.

And so it takes people some time to learn that.\u201dPotential residents apply through the Boston Housing Authority, and then are screened by Pine Street. Folks have moved in gradually over the past few months, Downie said, and the building is expected to be full by June.With a gentle demeanor and a quick smile, Montanino proudly showed off his new home last week. He\u2019s learning to cook, and there are spices and oil next to his stove \u2014 he\u2019s done steaks and chicken, burgers, and salads. He\u2019s volunteering, and has lined up a job \u2014 he starts in April. He dreams of adopting a child, as his mother did him.\u201cMy life\u2019s back,\u201d Montanino said. \u201cI get up early in the morning.

        "hed": "Josh Kraft wants to bring rent control back to Boston. But not the same rent control as Michelle Wu proposed.",
        "subhead": "The proposal by Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s challenger is not really rent control in the traditional sense, housing experts and political observers say. Regardless, his embrace of the term appears to be a calculated move.",
        "content": "On the day he launched his mayoral campaign, Josh Kraft went on the offensive, assailing Mayor Michelle Wu over her record on bike lanes and housing construction. That was no surprise.But one avenue of attack raised eyebrows across the city. Kraft said he would make good on a progressive policy promise that Wu had tried but failed: Bringing rent control back to Boston.\u201cMayor Wu promised us rent control three years ago,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cWe will deliver it finally.\u201dThat Kraft, the son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft and a favored candidate in some corners of the business community, would lean into an issue that many economists believe does more harm than good and most landlords despise, signals just how big a problem the cost of housing has become for everyday Bostonians. Yet the specifics of his proposal suggest he\u2019s trying to walk a fine political line to appeal to two very different political constituencies that rarely see eye to eye: the business community and tenants.While Kraft calls his proposal rent control, housing experts and political observers said it is not really rent control in the traditional sense of the hard rent caps seen in New York City, San Francisco, and Boston before state voters outlawed them here in 1994. It is instead an optional program for landlords who would receive tax breaks if they agree to cap annual rent increases. While it could be appealing for property owners to participate, it is not mandatory. And critics argue Kraft\u2019s plan may simply provide some landlords with tax breaks, while doing little to protect struggling renters.Related: Josh Kraft\u2019s tax break for \u2018good landlords\u2019 already exists, and the Boston City Council just voted for itAdvertisementBut his embrace of a term once considered politically untenable appears to be a calculated move. The idea of rent control has become increasingly popular in some corners of the city as rents climb relentlessly upward. And these days, political observers say, winning an election in Boston requires a whatever-it-takes approach to housing affordability.\u201c[Kraft\u2019s proposal] is not rent control, but the fact that he\u2019s proposing it shows how significant an issue housing has become for the city,\u201d said Josh Zakim, a former city councilor who served alongside Wu and who now runs a housing advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest issue facing the city and the Commonwealth, and I don\u2019t think you can run a serious campaign for public office here without a plan to address it.\u201dAdvertisementKraft\u2019s plan takes considerable cues from the version of rent control that Wu tried unsuccessfully to push through the state Legislature in 2023. Like Wu\u2019s plan, it would tie allowable rent hikes to inflation, with a hard cap of 10 percent per year. While Wu\u2019s set no income guidelines, Kraft\u2019s plan would be open to tenants who make less than 200 percent of the Area Median Income, more than $300,000 for a family of four, which he said would prevent luxury buildings from participating.Mayor Michelle Wu looked on as the City Council voted to approve her proposal to restore rent control in Boston in 2023. The measure later died on Beacon Hill.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe biggest differences are that Kraft\u2019s program would be optional for landlords, and would come with a sweetener: property tax breaks of 20 percent for participating buildings. Kraft said he\u2019d pay for that with tax revenue generated by new residential construction, which he hopes to spark by lowering affordable housing requirements.The city requires 20 percent of units in new developments to be set aside at affordable rents. Kraft wants to lower it to 13 percent, the rule that was in place before Wu took office.Kraft\u2019s campaign said that because the money would be distributed to landlords in the form of grants, as opposed to formal tax rebates, his plan would not need to go through the state Legislature (though that point is disputed by some advocates and legislators).\u201cJosh\u2019s opt-in rent control plan would provide real relief to renters, unlike Mayor Wu\u2019s failed plan that has helped no one,\u201d the Kraft campaign said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another unfulfilled promise which Mayor Wu needs to explain to voters instead of calling names and making excuses.\u201dRelated: Who is Josh Kraft, the nonprofit leader and son of the Patriots owner challenging Michelle Wu for mayor?AdvertisementFor her part, Wu assailed Kraft\u2019s plan, calling it \u201cfake rent control.\u201d She said he is using the promise of rent control to win over struggling renters who are hurting, while offering them no real protections.\u201cThis program, a voluntary program, is not going to \u2026 protect against the worst offenders [of extreme rent hikes],\u201d Wu said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio last week. \u201cIt is a use of resources without offering the types of protections that we really need.\u201dWu has not reintroduced her rent control plan since it died in the Legislature last year.So far, no prominent tenant groups have come out in support of Kraft\u2019s plan, but it\u2019s getting a positive reception among some real estate interests, who lobbied against Wu\u2019s plan and ultimately helped sink it on Beacon Hill.Developers and landlords generally oppose mandatory rent caps because they limit a building\u2019s profitability, making it more difficult to attract the investors needed to build and therefore slowing new construction. They\u2019re also a political constituency that appears at least intrigued by \u2014 if not yet openly supportive of \u2014 Kraft\u2019s candidacy.\u201cWe have long been opposed to rent control because we have seen the impact it has on housing production,\u201d said Tamara Small, chief executive of real estate trade group NAIOP Massachusetts, which does not endorse political candidates. \u201cWhen the investors that finance housing development hear the words rent control, they flee. But this proposal is clearly different. I don\u2019t think it would hurt production the way [Wu\u2019s] proposal would.\u201dAdvertisementAn apartment building under construction in Jamaica Plain last year. New construction has slowed in Boston amid higher interest rates and materials costs. Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft has said he'd lower affordable housing requirements to help boost new projects.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffWhile it\u2019s unclear how many landlords may opt in to such a program, some have already indicated they may be interested. In some cases, the program may actually be profitable for landlords, as they\u2019d get tax breaks even in years when they wouldn\u2019t normally raise the rent above the proposed cap.Take Chris Lehman, cofounder of real estate investment group Groma. His group typically raises rent by an average of 3 to 5 percent a year across its more than 300-unit portfolio, well below the cap Kraft proposes. He conducted a financial feasibility analysis of Kraft\u2019s plan at the request of his campaign, and found that savings on taxes would make up for lost rent. He said he would consider enrolling the majority of his units.Related: Lessons in modern-day rent control, 3,000 miles from Boston\u201cIf there were an actual rent control, we would of course oppose it,\u201d he said. \u201dBut this program could mean lower rent increases for our residents without hurting development.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether Kraft\u2019s rent moderation policy will be enough to win over housing advocates and tenants who have historically come out in force for Wu and who have often demanded stronger affordability requirements in new development. At least one group of advocates, the Coalition for a Truly Affordable Boston, is more focused on his plan to cut affordability, which they called a \u201cdirect attack on Boston\u2019s affordability and housing justice efforts.\u201d\u201cIncreasing housing supply alone does not guarantee affordability \u2014 especially when developers are not required to build homes that meet the needs of our residents,\u201d said Shameeka Moreno, a member of the Boston Tenant Coalition.AdvertisementAnd lawmakers who\u2019ve long worked on housing issues say they\u2019re skeptical that Kraft\u2019s plan would generate enough affordable units to cancel out the ones lost by lowering affordable housing requirements, or do much to control Boston\u2019s soaring rents at all.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the words he\u2019s using \u2014 it\u2019s not rent control,\u201d said State Senator Lydia Edwards, a Wu ally and former city councilor from East Boston. \u201cI welcome creative policy solutions and that this is a major issue in the mayor\u2019s race. But this feels like he\u2019s using the term rent control in order to try to get some attention and some headlines.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Apartment buildings need a lot of wood. And around here, wood mostly comes from Canada.",
        "content": "There are two main ingredients in cost of building housing: labor and materials. Here in New England especially \u2014 where builders have long wrestled with the cost of construction \u2014 the 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports instituted this week by President Trump will make the latter even more expensive.Much of the softwood lumber and mass timber that goes into apartment buildings in Massachusetts comes from Canada, as does fabricated steel and aluminum. While costs vary, it\u2019s typical for materials to make up between 40 and 50 percent of a construction budget \u2014 with anywhere from 6 to 12 percent of that coming from imported goods, said Mike Kearns, chief operating officer of the New England region for construction management firm Shawmut Design and Construction in Boston.New tariffs are likely to spark a domino effect on costs, he says. A 25 percent premium on Canadian lumber could prompt a run on domestic suppliers \u2014 a market that\u2019s already at maximum capacity, Kearns said \u2014 which will in turn likely bring those domestic prices up, and further extend an already stressed supply chain.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why it costs so much to build housing in Greater BostonAdvertisementBuilders are constantly on the hunt for ways to bring costs down, but the tariffs are likely to affect whether a project\u2019s economics work \u2014 and whether builders can build. Indeed, in the Northeast, lumber costs comprise typically 15 to 18 percent of the cost of building a new home.\u201cIt\u2019s always this balancing act,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cIf that value proposition isn\u2019t there, then that\u2019s when you could see something pause.\u201dKearns stressed, however, that the industry is \u201ca long way from seeing [tariffs] shut down work,\u201d and that there are ways to navigate costs.Still, any adjustment in the existing tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber results in almost universal groans among wood suppliers who watch the changes closely, said Paul Rogers, purchasing manager at Shepley Wood Products, a supplier with offices in Hyannis, Nantucket, and Wellfleet. If the price of Canadian lumber effectively goes up 25 percent, the price charged by American mills in turn \u201cgoes up in sympathy,\u201d Rogers said.\u201cEverybody follows the numbers,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what side of the border it\u2019s coming from.\u201dAdvertisementThe margin on lumber is already slim \u2014 \u201cin the single digits,\u201d Rogers said \u2014 and tariffs further limit a lumber supplier\u2019s ability to negotiate pricing. Canadian softwood lumber like spruce, pine, and fir have carried tariffs since 1980, said Shepley president Tony Shepley. Now those will go up even higher.An apartment building under construction in Everett in 2023.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFor development projects in the Northeast, architects will often specify that they want Canadian softwood lumber \u2014 both for how it\u2019s grown and how it survives in the Northeastern climate, said Rita Ferris, president of the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association, which represents independent lumber and building material suppliers from Maine to Washington, D.C.There\u2019s huge concern about tariffs further slowing development of residential housing, which has already faced huge cost pressures, Ferris said.\u201cWe just don\u2019t grow enough of our own to meet our own demands,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cWe totally get the goal of putting America first and having American workers and all of that. But if you can\u2019t supply yourself, it\u2019s really an extra burden.\u201dTariffs are of course nothing new to the construction industry. Prior presidential administrations have instituted tariffs on materials including steel and lumber, boosting their overall price, wrote Paul Brussow, president of Rider Levett Bucknall North America, in the firm\u2019s recent quarterly construction cost report. That report saw typical costs in Boston climb 5.4 percent over the last year, second only to Chicago among major markets.\u201cWhile tariffs have had an impact, it was nothing compared to what inflation has done in recent years,\u201d Brussow wrote in January. \u201cWhen coupled with inflation and labor shortages, this trifecta, in the last few years, has strained supply chains, raised construction costs, and affected project timelines.\u201dRelated: A 10,000-unit housing development at Suffolk Downs is on hold indefinitely. Here\u2019s why.AdvertisementAdditional tariffs \u201care more likely to exacerbate these challenges, particularly for metals, plastics, and essential construction materials, potentially adding thousands to the cost of residential and commercial projects,\u201d Brussow wrote.For Riverdale Mills, a Northbridge company that makes steel wire mesh used in products like fences and lobster traps, the new tariffs are a one-two punch of bad news. Riverdale buys much of its steel from Canada \u2014 and an additional 25 percent tariff on steel will kick in on March 12. So by mid-month, the company will be paying 50 percent more for its most important raw material.The company\u2019s chief executive, James Knott Jr., said Riverdale can\u2019t avoid the tariffs by buying American steel, because US steelmakers used the tariffs as an excuse to jack up their own prices. They didn\u2019t even wait for the tariffs to begin.\u201cBack in February, the domestic guys all raised their prices in advance of those tariffs,\u201d Knott said.Knott has no intention of switching to a US source.\u201cRather than buy from a domestic supplier, I\u2019m going to buy from my reliable supplier in Canada,\u201d said Knott, \u201cbecause all the prices are equal.\u201dIronically, Knott said that most of the US suppliers are foreign-owned, but his Canadian supplier is owned by a US firm.The tariffs will harm him in another way, said Knott. About 35 to 45 percent of Riverdale\u2019s products are exported. But since the tariffs have boosted his production costs, his exported steel mesh will be too expensive to compete on world markets.Meanwhile Shepley of Shepley Wood Products said he would hope for \u201ccommon sense and cooler heads\u201d to prevail.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s our mission as an industry to protect consumers, to not let housing get driven further out of reach, and to get things settled down,\u201d Shepley said. \u201cSo this was a bit of a shock to the system, but we\u2019ll hope that everybody pulls themselves together and gets this going.\u201dSteel and lumber, two major components in housing construction, both face substantial price increases amid 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada.David L.

        "content": "Thousands of drivers whiz by the vacant brick building perched precariously over the Mystic River every day without giving it a second thought. But city officials in Everett and Boston have been giving this former sewage pumphouse a lot of thought lately, as they eye it for potential restoration and redevelopment amid the broader rebirth underway around the Encore Boston Harbor casino across the street.Although it\u2019s on the Everett side of the river, the 15,000-square-foot pumphouse actually sits within a tiny sliver of Boston that extends along Alford Street (Route 99). Consultants are about to finish studying the feasibility of redoing the 19th-century building, as soon as this month, on behalf of the cities of Everett and Boston, and funded by state gaming commission funds.Ideas have ranged from turning it into a community center, to a kayak and canoe launch, to a beer hall. The leading concept, though, seems to be a ferry terminal, in part because the Kraft Group is eyeing the site next door to build a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution.\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about it,\u201d said Patrick Herron, executive director of the Mystic River Watershed Association. \u201cWhat a way to breathe life into a historic building on the edge of the water.\u201dAdvertisementKathy Abbott, chief executive of the nonprofit Boston Harbor Now, said the site is an ideal location for a ferry terminal because it\u2019s on the Boston Harbor side of the Alford Street bridge, whose low height prevents many commercial boats from passing under it. (Casino owner Wynn Resorts commissioned ferries purpose-built to fit under the bridge to serve casino customers.)While a boat landing could help with game-day transit for pro soccer games, Abbott said any terminal\u2019s full potential would depend on whether other public transportation projects proposed for the area come to fruition, such as a Silver Line bus-rapid-transit extension or a new commuter rail stop next to the casino.The conversations around the pumphouse, currently owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, started a few years ago, long before state lawmakers approved legislation in November that rezones the adjacent site for a soccer stadium. That legislation removes the site next door, home to a shuttered power plant, from what\u2019s known as a Designated Port Area, where only marine industrial uses can be developed.AdvertisementHowever, per state officials, the legislation left the pumphouse property in the DPA. That could pose a challenge to any redevelopment of the site, although a ferry terminal would be an allowed use within the zone. Other challenges include the limited space for parking and a dilapidated seawall that needs to be shored up.Herron said he expects state regulators would be willing to remove the site from the DPA because it\u2019s not currently home to industrial use. (The MWRA stopped pumping at the facility in 1993, replacing it with a more modern facility across the street, though an active sewer pipe passes under one portion of the 1890s building.)Everett and Boston officials are also engaged in discussions about a harborwalk extension that would bring the path along the Mystic River from the casino across the street, under the Alford Street bridge, and around the pumphouse to the stadium site.Tom Philbin, an environmental planner with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria\u2019s administration, said Massachusetts Gaming Commission grants have so far provided nearly $250,000 to design the 1,500-foot harborwalk extension and around $200,000 to study the feasibility of restoring the pumphouse. (The money comes out of community mitigation funds overseen by the gaming commission for casino host cities and nearby communities.)In a preliminary community agreement signed with DeMaria in late 2023, the Kraft Group agreed to pay for completing the harborwalk extension from the casino to the soccer stadium site. However, the Revs and Patriots ownership is not currently involved in the talks around the pumphouse\u2019s future.AdvertisementStacy Thompson, interim executive director at Historic Boston, the primary consultant studying the pumphouse\u2019s viability, said the restoration hinges on the eventual price tag. But she remains hopeful that the pumphouse could become an important piece in the broader mosaic of this new urban neighborhood gradually taking shape. At this time, any final decision on the building\u2019s fate would ultimately be up to the MWRA.\u201cThere\u2019s so much potential,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cCould it be a ferry station or a landing point? Yes. Could it be something else that serves the community? Yes. We\u2019re not there yet [but] we\u2019re getting closer to understanding what\u2019s possible.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

        "subhead": "There\u2019s one hitch: The site has a legacy of industrial contamination",
        "content": "Massachusetts state officials have offered up a prime location in Woburn for development: the 26-acre Anderson Regional Transportation Center.The transportation hub, at 100 Atlantic Ave., is owned by a joint venture of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and is home to a station for the MBTA\u2019s Lowell commuter rail line, Amtrak\u2019s Downeaster line, and Massport\u2019s Logan Express shuttles. Any development would need to retain or enhance the various transit uses. However, because of a history of pollution there, residential and school uses are currently not allowed.The goal is to find a developer willing to take some or all of the 2,400 surface parking spaces and consolidate them in a multi-level garage, opening up land for development. For now, the transit agencies are seeking \u201cexpressions of interest\u201d from developers to better understand the site\u2019s potential and the market demand. Responses are due by April 30.Other development activities nearby include the rezoning of 53 acres east of the rail line, to allow for multifamily construction in compliance with the MBTA Communities Act, the start of construction of a 425-unit multifamily project northwest of the transit hub, and permits issued for a 250-unit multifamily project north of the hub and a mixed-use project just to the west of it.AdvertisementOne of the biggest challenges, though, will be dealing with the property\u2019s contamination and its legacy as a Superfund site (a federal designation that identifies highly polluted properties). Industrial operations at the property, part of what was once known as the Industri-Plex site, contaminated the nearby Aberjona River as well as adjacent wetlands and the Mystic Lakes over the course of more than a century, through the 1960s. The transit agencies, in developing the Anderson center more than 20 years ago, built 25 acres of parking and a subsurface \u201cgeotextile\u201d barrier to help contain the underground pollution.For a developer to proceed with residential construction, the transit agencies said, it would need to work with federal and state environmental regulators to reevaluate the residential restriction.The transit hub is named after Jimmy Anderson, a child who died at the age of 12 from leukemia and whose case was made famous in the book and the movie, \u201cA Civil Action,\u201d about groundwater pollution in Woburn.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

        "hed": "For Mayor Wu, not all sports stadiums are created equal",
        "subhead": "The mayor\u2019s enthusiasm for the White Stadium project stands in sharp contrast to seven years ago, when she blocked a plan for a New England Revolution stadium as a city councilor",
        "content": "It wasn\u2019t that long ago that one of the most powerful members of the Boston City Council raised all sorts of questions about whether the city was moving too quickly to sell city land to a private developer for a professional soccer stadium.The councilor? Michelle Wu, who in 2018 stood in the way of then-Mayor Marty Walsh\u2019s plan to help Robert Kraft build a soccer stadium for his New England Revolution. Walsh wanted to issue a request for proposals, or an RFP, to sell an 18-acre city-owned tow lot in South Boston off the Southeast Expressway, as a way to give Kraft an opportunity at a site for a long-planned Revs stadium.But Walsh had to get his plan past Wu, who at the time chaired a council committee that had to declare the lot surplus property before it could be sold. And she wasn\u2019t going to just greenlight it.\u201cRather than just take a vote and move on, we should hear more from the public and gather more [information],\u201d Wu told the Globe at the time. \u201cPublic land should be used for the greatest public good. We haven\u2019t seen any analysis yet of what the greatest good would be.\u201dAdvertisementMy my, how the tables have turned.The lot never went up for sale \u2014 it\u2019s still where you go when your car gets towed from downtown \u2014 and Kraft moved on, setting his sights on building a stadium in Everett. But the more things change, the more they stay the same.Wu\u2019s now the mayor, trying to help a new professional women\u2019s soccer team turn White Stadium in Franklin Park into a gleaming new home. And now she, too, is getting in hot water over the city\u2019s RFP process.The White Stadium arrangement is different than the tow lot in that Wu is not selling the 10,000-seat facility to a private developer, but rather leasing it to Boston Unity Soccer Partners for 10 years. Under the deal, the city would continue to own the stadium, and the team would share it with Boston Public Schools. The city and team will split the cost of the renovation, which is expected to exceed $200 million.AdvertisementThe city tow lot south of downtown was once seen as a potential site for a stadium for the New England Revolution. But then-City Councilor Michelle Wu blocked a deal.David L. RyanWhite Stadium has been crumbling for decades, and many a mayor has tried to renovate it. The Wu administration contends that having a private partner is the only way the city can afford to fix it, and the deal struck with the team still gives the community and BPS full-day access to the stadium for all but 40 days of the year.But much as Wu did seven years ago, critics say the White Stadium plan is opaque, misguided, and being rammed through. The city, they say, needs to do more research on how best to renovate the stadium for BPS.This week we learned, as first reported in the Boston Herald, that Wu\u2019s City Hall has been in talks with Boston Unity Soccer Partners about White Stadium as early as September 2022. With the seed planted, the city issued an RFP in April 2023 for a lease of White Stadium in a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201dWe can all guess what happened next: The RFP went out, and Boston Unity Soccer Partners was the only group that submitted a proposal.Opponents of the White Stadium plan \u2014 some neighbors and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy \u2014 have seized on the Herald story, based on email exchanges between the team and city officials, as proof the team had an inside track on the stadium.Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft had choice words, too, calling the report evidence of a \u201csecretive and rigged RFP process.\u201dWu has vigorously disputed that characterization, calling it \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s nothing untoward about potential bidders having conversations with the city before an RFP is filed, and it\u2019s conceivable that the RFP generated only a single response.Advertisement(Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has had a minority interest in the women\u2019s soccer team, and last week she announced she is pulling out of the team\u2019s investor group.)As for what happened in 2018, Wu got on the phone on Thursday to say that she has been \u201ccompletely consistent\u201d on how there should be public discussions about how to use public land. She said the Walsh administration\u2019s proposal to sell the tow lot for a soccer stadium never went anywhere because no one was willing to publicly offer details at a hearing Wu chaired at the time.\u201cI was never opposed to a soccer stadium in Boston,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that we should try to bring that amenity and economic development opportunity and excitement to the city.\u201dWu went on to say that after becoming mayor she reached out to Robert Kraft about having the Revs stadium in Boston. She said she never heard back. (On Friday, a spokesperson for Robert Kraft said he never heard from the Wu administration.)The White Stadium deal reflects how she feels that public land should not be sold off, similar to how she felt as a councilor in 2018, and how public land as a general principle \u201cshould stay wherever possible, under the public trust, under public ownership, because that is how you have permanent control over what happens.\u201dStill, that hasn\u2019t placated opponents who have sued the city to halt the project, with the case set to go to trial on March 18. Demolition is well underway, and Wu said the construction schedule is on track. The women\u2019s team is planning to play in the renovated White Stadium by its inaugural season next spring.AdvertisementMeantime, it\u2019s a mayoral election year. Stadium opponents and supporters are worked up. And just as you thought the L\u2019Affaire White Stadium couldn\u2019t get any messier \u2014 it has.So, for Wu, perhaps we\u2019ll file this one under: Do as I say, not as I do.Shirley Leung is a Business columnist.

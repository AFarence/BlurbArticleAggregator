        "subhead": "The mayor\u2019s enthusiasm for the White Stadium project stands in sharp contrast to seven years ago, when she blocked a plan for a New England Revolution stadium as a city councilor",
        "content": "It wasn\u2019t that long ago that one of the most powerful members of the Boston City Council raised all sorts of questions about whether the city was moving too quickly to sell city land to a private developer for a professional soccer stadium.The councilor? Michelle Wu, who in 2018 stood in the way of then-Mayor Marty Walsh\u2019s plan to help Robert Kraft build a soccer stadium for his New England Revolution. Walsh wanted to issue a request for proposals, or an RFP, to sell an 18-acre city-owned tow lot in South Boston off the Southeast Expressway, as a way to give Kraft an opportunity at a site for a long-planned Revs stadium.But Walsh had to get his plan past Wu, who at the time chaired a council committee that had to declare the lot surplus property before it could be sold. And she wasn\u2019t going to just greenlight it.\u201cRather than just take a vote and move on, we should hear more from the public and gather more [information],\u201d Wu told the Globe at the time. \u201cPublic land should be used for the greatest public good. We haven\u2019t seen any analysis yet of what the greatest good would be.\u201dAdvertisementMy my, how the tables have turned.The lot never went up for sale \u2014 it\u2019s still where you go when your car gets towed from downtown \u2014 and Kraft moved on, setting his sights on building a stadium in Everett. But the more things change, the more they stay the same.Wu\u2019s now the mayor, trying to help a new professional women\u2019s soccer team turn White Stadium in Franklin Park into a gleaming new home. And now she, too, is getting in hot water over the city\u2019s RFP process.The White Stadium arrangement is different than the tow lot in that Wu is not selling the 10,000-seat facility to a private developer, but rather leasing it to Boston Unity Soccer Partners for 10 years. Under the deal, the city would continue to own the stadium, and the team would share it with Boston Public Schools. The city and team will split the cost of the renovation, which is expected to exceed $200 million.AdvertisementThe city tow lot south of downtown was once seen as a potential site for a stadium for the New England Revolution. But then-City Councilor Michelle Wu blocked a deal.David L. RyanWhite Stadium has been crumbling for decades, and many a mayor has tried to renovate it. The Wu administration contends that having a private partner is the only way the city can afford to fix it, and the deal struck with the team still gives the community and BPS full-day access to the stadium for all but 40 days of the year.But much as Wu did seven years ago, critics say the White Stadium plan is opaque, misguided, and being rammed through. The city, they say, needs to do more research on how best to renovate the stadium for BPS.This week we learned, as first reported in the Boston Herald, that Wu\u2019s City Hall has been in talks with Boston Unity Soccer Partners about White Stadium as early as September 2022. With the seed planted, the city issued an RFP in April 2023 for a lease of White Stadium in a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201dWe can all guess what happened next: The RFP went out, and Boston Unity Soccer Partners was the only group that submitted a proposal.Opponents of the White Stadium plan \u2014 some neighbors and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy \u2014 have seized on the Herald story, based on email exchanges between the team and city officials, as proof the team had an inside track on the stadium.Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft had choice words, too, calling the report evidence of a \u201csecretive and rigged RFP process.\u201dWu has vigorously disputed that characterization, calling it \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s nothing untoward about potential bidders having conversations with the city before an RFP is filed, and it\u2019s conceivable that the RFP generated only a single response.Advertisement(Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has had a minority interest in the women\u2019s soccer team, and last week she announced she is pulling out of the team\u2019s investor group.)As for what happened in 2018, Wu got on the phone on Thursday to say that she has been \u201ccompletely consistent\u201d on how there should be public discussions about how to use public land. She said the Walsh administration\u2019s proposal to sell the tow lot for a soccer stadium never went anywhere because no one was willing to publicly offer details at a hearing Wu chaired at the time.\u201cI was never opposed to a soccer stadium in Boston,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that we should try to bring that amenity and economic development opportunity and excitement to the city.\u201dWu went on to say that after becoming mayor she reached out to Robert Kraft about having the Revs stadium in Boston. She said she never heard back. (On Friday, a spokesperson for Robert Kraft said he never heard from the Wu administration.)The White Stadium deal reflects how she feels that public land should not be sold off, similar to how she felt as a councilor in 2018, and how public land as a general principle \u201cshould stay wherever possible, under the public trust, under public ownership, because that is how you have permanent control over what happens.\u201dStill, that hasn\u2019t placated opponents who have sued the city to halt the project, with the case set to go to trial on March 18. Demolition is well underway, and Wu said the construction schedule is on track. The women\u2019s team is planning to play in the renovated White Stadium by its inaugural season next spring.AdvertisementMeantime, it\u2019s a mayoral election year. Stadium opponents and supporters are worked up. And just as you thought the L\u2019Affaire White Stadium couldn\u2019t get any messier \u2014 it has.So, for Wu, perhaps we\u2019ll file this one under: Do as I say, not as I do.Shirley Leung is a Business columnist.

        "hed": "Middleborough sues Healey, state over MBTA housing law requirements",
        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The town of Middleborough sued Governor Maura Healey and the state housing office Friday, seeking an exemption from the controversial MBTA Communities Act, which requires cities and towns served by the T to make it easier to build multifamily housing within their borders.The lawsuit asks for a waiver from the law\u2019s zoning requirements under a recent opinion from State Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who called the law an \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d because, she said, the Legislature did not designate adequate funds for its implementation.Related: More controversy erupts after state auditor says Mass. housing law is an \u2018unfunded mandate\u2019Middleborough, the town said in the lawsuit, has already built housing near its commuter rail station in recent years, and should not be forced to make room for more. Adhering to the law\u2019s requirements would be a \u201csignificant expense\u201d because the town does not have the infrastructure to accommodate more development, it said. Lawyers for the town added that the state has gone too far in punishing towns it deems noncompliant, carrying out a \u201ccampaign of threats, intimidation, and coercion.\u201dMiddleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law\u2019s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.AdvertisementThe town wrote to DiZoglio\u2019s office last year requesting her to weigh in on the law, and when Middleborough officials received her opinion last week calling it an unfunded mandate, they moved quickly to prepare a lawsuit.For the Healey administration, this is yet another roadblock for a law that it inherited from the Legislature but has become central to its housing strategy.The administration set a goal in February of building 222,000 new homes by 2035 in order to head off the housing shortage, which is quickly warping the economic reality of everyday residents. The state is well behind the pace of construction needed to meet that goal, and officials see MBTA Communities \u2014 Massachusetts\u2019 most consequential new housing law in decades \u2014 as key to course correcting. Most of the state\u2019s housing production over the last several decades has happened in Boston and a few neighboring communities. The law is designed to stimulate housing production in the suburbs and towns in Eastern Massachusetts that have long shut out new development.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysAdvertisementBut towns have not taken kindly to the law. Some see it as an affront on Massachusetts' tradition of local government decisions over land-use rules, and many do not want to encourage the production of more homes, particularly apartment buildings.The law requires 177 cities and towns with access to the T create zoning districts that allow for multifamily housing, but it does not mandate building.Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued the town of Milton last year for failing to meet the law\u2019s requirements, and the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law, though it also ruled that the state must put the guidelines that shape its implementation through a formal regulatory process.Campbell, in a statement Friday, said her office will defend the law.\u201cI am grateful to the majority of communities that understand the importance of responsible zoning, and my office and I intend to successfully defend this law in court,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Auditor\u2019s incorrect legal assessment has spurred challenges to a law meant to address our housing crisis.\u201dMiddleborough officials say the town created a multifamily zoning district in 2021 that has since yielded 174 multifamily units, a quarter of which are set at affordable rents. And over the last 20 years, the town has seen 881 housing units built within a mile of its commuter rail station.Related: How will the state\u2019s historic rezoning mandate affect your community?AdvertisementIt argues that should be enough to satisfy the requirements of MBTA Communities. But under the law, the town has to create zoning that makes room for at least 1,471 units. The zoning the town passed in 2021 only allows for 549 units.Lawyers for the town said it has been unfairly punished for not complying with the law\u2019s requirements \u201cthrough the withholding and/or recission of more than $6.5 million in funding for school programs, infrastructure projects, and other initiatives that are necessary to provide the very housing the Act was enacted to create.\u201d Those funding programs are discretionary, and the state has, in some cases, tied towns\u2019 chances of approval to their MBTA Communities compliance status.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new in Middleboro. We recognize the need for more housing near public transit as a function of responsible town planning,\u201d Middleborough Town Manager James McGrail said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our part. We are not anti-housing. The fact that we\u2019re even having to go to court to sort this out is crazy.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.",

        "content": "A team of Boston developers and Chicago investors have unveiled their designs for a pair of 18-story apartment towers on the site of the former WLVI television studio in Dorchester, the first phase of an already approved project that would bring five other buildings to that stretch of Morrissey Boulevard.Local development firm Copper Mill and an entity managed by Chicago-based investor POB Capital are proposing two towers with a combined 754 apartments near the JFK/UMass MBTA stop, next to the former headquarters of The Boston Globe, now a lab and office complex called Southline.The development team \u201cis committed to delivering a mixed-use program that serves the long-term interests of Savin Hill, Columbia Point and greater Dorchester neighborhoods,\u201d wrote Andrew Flynn, Copper Mill\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a December letter to the Boston Planning Department.AdvertisementA rendering of two 18-story residential towers proposed at 75 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester.CBTDesigned by Boston-based CBT Architects, the towers \u2014 one at 204 feet facing Morrissey Boulevard, another at 206 feet facing Interstate 93 \u2014 would each have three levels of underground parking. Between them, the developers have planned a roughly half-acre community park.The Morrissey Boulevard project stretches nearly 9 acres from 35-75 Morrissey Blvd., including the Star Market grocery store and former TV studio along with the former Beasley Media radio studios. A seven-building master plan, approved by the Boston Planning and Development Agency board in 2023 \u2014 albeit under a different developer \u2014 calls for three apartment buildings and four office/lab buildings.The BPDA board-approved master plan calls for a grocery store to be included within the third planned residential tower. The radio site at 55 Morrissey Blvd. now houses The Record Co., which offers affordable recording studio and rehearsal spaces.

        "content": "Massachusetts state officials have offered up a prime location in Woburn for development: the 26-acre Anderson Regional Transportation Center.The transportation hub, at 100 Atlantic Ave., is owned by a joint venture of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and is home to a station for the MBTA\u2019s Lowell commuter rail line, Amtrak\u2019s Downeaster line, and Massport\u2019s Logan Express shuttles. Any development would need to retain or enhance the various transit uses. However, because of a history of pollution there, residential and school uses are currently not allowed.The goal is to find a developer willing to take some or all of the 2,400 surface parking spaces and consolidate them in a multi-level garage, opening up land for development. For now, the transit agencies are seeking \u201cexpressions of interest\u201d from developers to better understand the site\u2019s potential and the market demand. Responses are due by April 30.Other development activities nearby include the rezoning of 53 acres east of the rail line, to allow for multifamily construction in compliance with the MBTA Communities Act, the start of construction of a 425-unit multifamily project northwest of the transit hub, and permits issued for a 250-unit multifamily project north of the hub and a mixed-use project just to the west of it.AdvertisementOne of the biggest challenges, though, will be dealing with the property\u2019s contamination and its legacy as a Superfund site (a federal designation that identifies highly polluted properties). Industrial operations at the property, part of what was once known as the Industri-Plex site, contaminated the nearby Aberjona River as well as adjacent wetlands and the Mystic Lakes over the course of more than a century, through the 1960s. The transit agencies, in developing the Anderson center more than 20 years ago, built 25 acres of parking and a subsurface \u201cgeotextile\u201d barrier to help contain the underground pollution.For a developer to proceed with residential construction, the transit agencies said, it would need to work with federal and state environmental regulators to reevaluate the residential restriction.The transit hub is named after Jimmy Anderson, a child who died at the age of 12 from leukemia and whose case was made famous in the book and the movie, \u201cA Civil Action,\u201d about groundwater pollution in Woburn.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

He dealt with learning disabilities and lingering effects of malnutrition from his earliest years, then went on to run track in high school and graduate from North Shore Community College.Montanino struggled with alcoholism in his college years \u2014 a problem that led him to living on the streets for nearly two years. He\u2019d bounce back and forth from the Constitution Beach Walk to Jeffries Point, to the library and the flower shop. Sometimes he did food app delivery on foot for $7 an order.\u201cThat was my homeless life, just going from one thing to another ... never really knowing where my next meal was coming from,\u201d he said.AdvertisementThese days, though, Montanino is calling Jamaica Plain home. He\u2019s one of the new residents at 3368 Washington St., a five-story, $105 million residential building celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. Developed by Boston-based The Community Builders and homeless services provider Pine Street Inn, the building \u2014 to be named \u201cThe Lyndia\u201d in honor of Pine Street Inn executive director Lyndia Downie \u2014 is the largest permanent supportive housing development in New England. The 202-unit building includes 140 studios for formerly unhoused people referred by Pine Street in one wing, and 62 affordable units for families in another.The city of Boston provided some $17.3 million to the project, and supported it amid a lengthy lawsuit that challenged its zoning.Related: \u2018Permanent supportive housing\u2019 may be controversial to would-be neighbors, but it\u2019s been beneficial to those who live in it | Shirley Leung\u201cTo solve homelessness, you have to tackle the roots of the problem, which is making sure that people can have a home, and have support in living in their homes,\u201d said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. \u201cYou really have to have a plan for homes to be accessible and supportive for everyone.\u201dDownie has long championed permanent supportive housing, which is basically an apartment with social services on site, and Pine Street has gradually grown its inventory of such buildings in recent years. Advocates say tackling the roots of homelessness requires more than just handing out grants, and instead making sure individuals have both a roof over their heads and access to health and wellness support systems to guide them through a world-upending transition. Montanino said he is frequently connected with security and outreach personnel, case managers, a personal landlord, and property managers, all of whom helped him move \u2014 and stay \u2014 off the streets.Advertisement\u201cThey\u2019re all hands on deck here,\u201d he said.Michael Montanino in his new unit at 3368 Washington St.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe 3368 Washington project includes support services like onsite mental health counseling, 24/7 security, and key fob-activated elevators. Residents are directly referred by Pine Street Inn. On a recent tour of the building, fliers for workforce development programs with Pine Street and Roxbury Community College were available for anyone to read.The property was formerly a low-slung warehouse, which Pine Street bought in 1997 and over the years used for a variety of functions, including office space for case workers and a small woodworking program. As Pine Street ramped up its housing development efforts, the site stood out, particularly given its proximity to the Green Street Orange Line station. Most developers responded to Pine Street\u2019s bid for proposals with pitches for around 40 to 60 units, Downie said. But Bart Mitchell, CEO of The Community Builders, aimed higher.\u201cBart and I went over to look at the site, and Bart, even that day, said, \u2018Look, if we can get some height relief, we can do something really sustainable here. We can get some scale,\u2019\u201d Downie said. \u201cThat was what, for us, was so exciting. ... The more long-term people you can move out, the better chance you have of meeting shelter demand.\u201dThe project hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. The landlord of a neighboring property sued in 2020, alleging the zoning process to allow the project was flawed. Though the lawsuit eventually settled, the delay cost \u201cmultiple millions\u201d of dollars, said Andy Waxman, Community Builders\u2019 senior vice president of real estate.AdvertisementPine Street and The Community Builders are collaborating on similar projects, including 900 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester, which is under construction now.

And so it takes people some time to learn that.\u201dPotential residents apply through the Boston Housing Authority, and then are screened by Pine Street. Folks have moved in gradually over the past few months, Downie said, and the building is expected to be full by June.With a gentle demeanor and a quick smile, Montanino proudly showed off his new home last week. He\u2019s learning to cook, and there are spices and oil next to his stove \u2014 he\u2019s done steaks and chicken, burgers, and salads. He\u2019s volunteering, and has lined up a job \u2014 he starts in April.

        "content": "When Fortis Property Group announced a $1 billion refinancing of One Lincoln St. in 2022, the developers championed the deal as a milestone for downtown Boston\u2019s revitalization.Fortis had landed a deal to lease 11 floors of the 36-story office building to private equity company HarbourVest and promised a heap of amenities \u2014 rooftop tennis and basketball courts, an artisanal market, and biergarten \u2014 to draw more tenants to fill the rest of the half-empty tower. Those plans attracted sophisticated investors, including San Francisco-based DivcoWest and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, according to a real estate industry source with knowledge of the deal.\u201cThis is an important moment for our firm and all of our partners,\u201d said Joel Kestenbaum, president of Brooklyn-based Fortis, at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t be prouder to see this deal come to fruition after nearly a year in the making.\u201dNext week, the 503-foot tower will go up for auction \u2014 a move forced by one of Fortis\u2019s unpaid lenders.AdvertisementIt\u2019s a stunning turn of events for a building whose blue glass and gray granite facade has long been one of the most prominent points on Boston\u2019s skyline. For two decades, it was home to State Street Corp., until 2023, when the financial giant decamped for a new tower across town.One Lincoln never recovered, and today \u2014 despite HarbourVest\u2019s arrival \u2014 the building still stands about half empty. There are at least four big loans on the tower, and with little rent coming in, Fortis has struggled to pay down its substantial debt. Now lenders want the money back. In the auction process, a new owner will likely take over the building.The facade at One Lincoln St.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFortis did not respond to a request for comment.While it\u2019s not clear how much One Lincoln will fetch at auction, it\u2019s fair to expect a far lower sum than the $1 billion valuation it commanded in 2022. That\u2019s a reality facing many commercial real estate owners in Boston right now. Five years after COVID upended the city\u2019s office market, a long-delayed reckoning on the value of office towers is coming, with major implications on the city\u2019s tax base and the future of downtown.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s like the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s not a loss until you sell it,\u201d said Dion Sorrentino, associate director of market analytics at CoStar Group in Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hold it for as long as they can.\u201dFor a dozen years after the 2008 financial crisis, commercial real estate prices steadily rose in Boston, generating eye-popping sales numbers and fueling the city\u2019s budget. Rock-bottom interest rates made borrowing easy and cheap. Companies poured into downtown to tap the city\u2019s talented young workforce. By the end of 2019, office vacancy was in the single digits and investors spent more than $8 billion that year alone to snap up commercial real estate that, by all accounts, was going to remain valuable for years to come.Then came the pandemic. Demand for office space plummeted, and today the vacancy rate is 21.1 percent, according to real estate firm Newmark. Meanwhile interest rates skyrocketed. That made it more expensive to borrow money for development projects and to refinance existing debt, particularly loans made at low, pre-COVID, interest rates.A developer has proposed converting 400 Atlantic Ave., a low-lying brick office facing Boston Harbor, into a hotel.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffDowntown landlords could hang on, for a time.While there are abundant smaller owners, many premier buildings in Boston are owned \u2014 in full or in part \u2014 by large real estate firms such as Boston Properties and Tishman Speyer; private equity like Rockpoint Group; or investment arms of pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, such as Oxford Properties and Norges Bank. Their deep pockets bought them time, and lenders offered extensions on repayments for a year or two, said Mark Fallon, director of research and strategy at real estate brokerage Hunneman in Boston.AdvertisementFor years, that \u201cextend and pretend\u201d phenomenon kept Boston\u2019s commercial real estate sales market in relative stasis. Meanwhile owners fished for lucrative new leases to pay down their debt. The prospect of converting office to lab space \u2014 expensive, but with the potential to draw in high-paying life-science companies as tenants \u2014 continued to generate hope for a turnaround.But mostly, local owners have held off on selling for a simple reason, said Jeffrey Havsy of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no forcing mechanism, if the debt wasn\u2019t due.\u201dNow though, those bills are coming due, prompting new momentum in the sales market. For many, the decision to sell will be difficult and costly: Havsy said many downtown buildings could sell for 40 to 60 percent of their pre-COVID price.The trend is one that city officials and financial watchdogs are monitoring closely. Some 71.1 percent of Boston\u2019s $4.6 billion budget is funded by property taxes \u2014 much of it on commercial property \u2014 and price declines could hit that revenue hard. But the change could also lower rents, potentially broadening the number of tenants who can afford space downtown.Related: Corporate signs are proliferating on Boston's skylineA price reset, Havsy said, can also loosen up opportunities for investors with cash and patience, like Norges Bank. In December, an arm of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund paid $248 per square foot for just over half of 33 Arch St., according to research from real estate firm Avison Young. That\u2019s less than half the $606 per square foot that retirement behemoth TIAA paid to buy the 33-story downtown tower in 2011. (Norges bought out the first half of TIAA\u2019s stake in 2013.)Advertisement\u201cIn a period of heightened dislocation in the office sector, we see this as an opportune moment to invest,\u201d said Norges real estate executive Per L\u00f8ken in a statement. Along with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Norges also bought just over half of 501 Boylston St. in Back Bay \u2014 noting its $194.9 million in existing debt \u2014 giving it full control of the building after it bought the first half in 2018.TIAA did not respond to a Globe request for comment.That kind of real estate calculus \u2014 or perhaps musical chairs \u2014 can get tricky fast, leaving a fair amount of uncertainty as to what buildings are actually worth. In the past five years, it\u2019s been tough to discern the pandemic\u2019s impact on office values, and, in turn, municipal tax revenues \u2014 in large part because many owners haven\u2019t had to sell.\u201cWhat is happening now is a reset,\u201d said Jason S. Weissman, founder of Boston Realty Advisors. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing it all over.\u201dMany of the city\u2019s largest taxpayers are commercial landlords. One Lincoln, the tower up for auction in March, owes more than $15 million in net tax to the city this fiscal year. The 32-story office tower at 99 High St., which went up for sale in July, owes $8.6 million in net taxes. The value of those buildings has an outsize impact on city finances, one reason Mayor Michelle Wu last year sought to hike commercial tax rates to keep revenue flowing. That effort stalled in the state Senate, but she is trying again this year.The 32-story office tower at 99 High St. was listed for sale in July 2024.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in downtown property values could represent a mammoth hit to city finances. The Boston Municipal Research Bureau, an independent financial watchdog organization, in November explored how the city could diversify its revenue sources to not be so heavily dependent on property taxes.AdvertisementOf course, not all buildings are selling for a loss. An entity of Qatari investor Ezdan Holding Group paid $99.5 million for the 11-story office at 855 Boylston St. in Back Bay in fall 2023 \u2014 more than double what the property sold for in 2000. And, generally speaking, newer and higher-end buildings have maintained stronger demand from tenants willing to pay top-tier rents.But for buildings with low occupancy, it\u2019s difficult to restructure debt, said Aaron Jodka, the director of US capital markets research for Colliers. That\u2019s opening up avenues for buyers \u2014 family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other private investors \u2014 who are seeing \u201ca generational acquisition opportunity,\u201d Jodka said, and sometimes a chance to try something other than office space.One example: JAJ Investment Group, the Luxembourg-based family office of French financier Jacques Chahine, plans to convert 400 Atlantic Ave. \u2014 a low-lying former law office facing Boston Harbor \u2014 into a hotel. The office was formerly the longtime home of Goulston & Storrs, which moved to nearby One Post Office Square last April.\u201cWhen there is upheaval and change in the market, it does create new opportunities for others,\u201d Jodka said. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s usually the pain the previous owner has to go through.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "On the day he launched his mayoral campaign, Josh Kraft went on the offensive, assailing Mayor Michelle Wu over her record on bike lanes and housing construction. That was no surprise.But one avenue of attack raised eyebrows across the city. Kraft said he would make good on a progressive policy promise that Wu had tried but failed: Bringing rent control back to Boston.\u201cMayor Wu promised us rent control three years ago,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cWe will deliver it finally.\u201dThat Kraft, the son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft and a favored candidate in some corners of the business community, would lean into an issue that many economists believe does more harm than good and most landlords despise, signals just how big a problem the cost of housing has become for everyday Bostonians. Yet the specifics of his proposal suggest he\u2019s trying to walk a fine political line to appeal to two very different political constituencies that rarely see eye to eye: the business community and tenants.While Kraft calls his proposal rent control, housing experts and political observers said it is not really rent control in the traditional sense of the hard rent caps seen in New York City, San Francisco, and Boston before state voters outlawed them here in 1994. It is instead an optional program for landlords who would receive tax breaks if they agree to cap annual rent increases. While it could be appealing for property owners to participate, it is not mandatory. And critics argue Kraft\u2019s plan may simply provide some landlords with tax breaks, while doing little to protect struggling renters.Related: Josh Kraft\u2019s tax break for \u2018good landlords\u2019 already exists, and the Boston City Council just voted for itAdvertisementBut his embrace of a term once considered politically untenable appears to be a calculated move. The idea of rent control has become increasingly popular in some corners of the city as rents climb relentlessly upward. And these days, political observers say, winning an election in Boston requires a whatever-it-takes approach to housing affordability.\u201c[Kraft\u2019s proposal] is not rent control, but the fact that he\u2019s proposing it shows how significant an issue housing has become for the city,\u201d said Josh Zakim, a former city councilor who served alongside Wu and who now runs a housing advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest issue facing the city and the Commonwealth, and I don\u2019t think you can run a serious campaign for public office here without a plan to address it.\u201dAdvertisementKraft\u2019s plan takes considerable cues from the version of rent control that Wu tried unsuccessfully to push through the state Legislature in 2023. Like Wu\u2019s plan, it would tie allowable rent hikes to inflation, with a hard cap of 10 percent per year. While Wu\u2019s set no income guidelines, Kraft\u2019s plan would be open to tenants who make less than 200 percent of the Area Median Income, more than $300,000 for a family of four, which he said would prevent luxury buildings from participating.Mayor Michelle Wu looked on as the City Council voted to approve her proposal to restore rent control in Boston in 2023. The measure later died on Beacon Hill.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe biggest differences are that Kraft\u2019s program would be optional for landlords, and would come with a sweetener: property tax breaks of 20 percent for participating buildings. Kraft said he\u2019d pay for that with tax revenue generated by new residential construction, which he hopes to spark by lowering affordable housing requirements.The city requires 20 percent of units in new developments to be set aside at affordable rents. Kraft wants to lower it to 13 percent, the rule that was in place before Wu took office.Kraft\u2019s campaign said that because the money would be distributed to landlords in the form of grants, as opposed to formal tax rebates, his plan would not need to go through the state Legislature (though that point is disputed by some advocates and legislators).\u201cJosh\u2019s opt-in rent control plan would provide real relief to renters, unlike Mayor Wu\u2019s failed plan that has helped no one,\u201d the Kraft campaign said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another unfulfilled promise which Mayor Wu needs to explain to voters instead of calling names and making excuses.\u201dRelated: Who is Josh Kraft, the nonprofit leader and son of the Patriots owner challenging Michelle Wu for mayor?AdvertisementFor her part, Wu assailed Kraft\u2019s plan, calling it \u201cfake rent control.\u201d She said he is using the promise of rent control to win over struggling renters who are hurting, while offering them no real protections.\u201cThis program, a voluntary program, is not going to \u2026 protect against the worst offenders [of extreme rent hikes],\u201d Wu said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio last week. \u201cIt is a use of resources without offering the types of protections that we really need.\u201dWu has not reintroduced her rent control plan since it died in the Legislature last year.So far, no prominent tenant groups have come out in support of Kraft\u2019s plan, but it\u2019s getting a positive reception among some real estate interests, who lobbied against Wu\u2019s plan and ultimately helped sink it on Beacon Hill.Developers and landlords generally oppose mandatory rent caps because they limit a building\u2019s profitability, making it more difficult to attract the investors needed to build and therefore slowing new construction. They\u2019re also a political constituency that appears at least intrigued by \u2014 if not yet openly supportive of \u2014 Kraft\u2019s candidacy.\u201cWe have long been opposed to rent control because we have seen the impact it has on housing production,\u201d said Tamara Small, chief executive of real estate trade group NAIOP Massachusetts, which does not endorse political candidates. \u201cWhen the investors that finance housing development hear the words rent control, they flee. But this proposal is clearly different. I don\u2019t think it would hurt production the way [Wu\u2019s] proposal would.\u201dAdvertisementAn apartment building under construction in Jamaica Plain last year. New construction has slowed in Boston amid higher interest rates and materials costs. Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft has said he'd lower affordable housing requirements to help boost new projects.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffWhile it\u2019s unclear how many landlords may opt in to such a program, some have already indicated they may be interested. In some cases, the program may actually be profitable for landlords, as they\u2019d get tax breaks even in years when they wouldn\u2019t normally raise the rent above the proposed cap.Take Chris Lehman, cofounder of real estate investment group Groma. His group typically raises rent by an average of 3 to 5 percent a year across its more than 300-unit portfolio, well below the cap Kraft proposes. He conducted a financial feasibility analysis of Kraft\u2019s plan at the request of his campaign, and found that savings on taxes would make up for lost rent. He said he would consider enrolling the majority of his units.Related: Lessons in modern-day rent control, 3,000 miles from Boston\u201cIf there were an actual rent control, we would of course oppose it,\u201d he said. \u201dBut this program could mean lower rent increases for our residents without hurting development.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether Kraft\u2019s rent moderation policy will be enough to win over housing advocates and tenants who have historically come out in force for Wu and who have often demanded stronger affordability requirements in new development. At least one group of advocates, the Coalition for a Truly Affordable Boston, is more focused on his plan to cut affordability, which they called a \u201cdirect attack on Boston\u2019s affordability and housing justice efforts.\u201d\u201cIncreasing housing supply alone does not guarantee affordability \u2014 especially when developers are not required to build homes that meet the needs of our residents,\u201d said Shameeka Moreno, a member of the Boston Tenant Coalition.AdvertisementAnd lawmakers who\u2019ve long worked on housing issues say they\u2019re skeptical that Kraft\u2019s plan would generate enough affordable units to cancel out the ones lost by lowering affordable housing requirements, or do much to control Boston\u2019s soaring rents at all.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the words he\u2019s using \u2014 it\u2019s not rent control,\u201d said State Senator Lydia Edwards, a Wu ally and former city councilor from East Boston. \u201cI welcome creative policy solutions and that this is a major issue in the mayor\u2019s race. But this feels like he\u2019s using the term rent control in order to try to get some attention and some headlines.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "The stately brick homes on Beacon Hill aren\u2019t the only real estate that\u2019s selling for a premium fee.A single parking spot in a garage on Brimmer Street is on the market for $750,000, according to a real estate listing posted last week. It\u2019s just the latest spot to notch a steep price tag in the neighborhood, where it seems the only thing more coveted than housing is parking.\u201cIt\u2019s a great long-term hold,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, a realtor for Cabot & Company and one of the spot\u2019s two listing agents. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be building any more parking on the hill.\u201dThe parking space, first reported on by the Boston Herald, is located in a luxury garage just off Storrow Drive that offers refueling, car washing, and other concierge services, according to the listing.AdvertisementRodriguez said the spot belongs to a family that recently closed a deal to sell their home in the neighborhood. Some potential buyers have shown interest in the space, but it was still \u201cvery much available\u201d as of Thursday, he added.Brimmer Street Garage, which bills itself as Beacon Hill\u2019s \u201cmost exclusive venue to capture a parking space,\u201d operates as a condominium; the spots are sold privately as deeded, taxable pieces of property.When homes are sold on Beacon Hill, the sellers usually include the value of their parking spaces in the overall sale price. Oftentimes, the deeds to the spaces are transferred by a symbolic payment, Rodriguez said.\u201cWhen [sellers] go to record the sale of the house, they also record the sale of the parking because it\u2019s a fully separate deed, and they\u2019ll just record it as $1,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we actually don\u2019t know what the true value was ... for that parking space.\u201dBut when parking spaces come on the market separately, they can fetch well over half a million dollars.\u201cThe owners of this space thought it made more sense to bring it to market and see what the market would bear,\u201d Rodriguez said.In 1979, single parking spaces at the Brimmer were being sold for $7,500, or roughly $35,000 in today\u2019s money, according to the garage\u2019s website.AdvertisementLast year, the most expensive parking spot in the garage sold for $565,000, Rodriguez said.It\u2019s rare for a parking space at a \u201cfull service\u201d garage like the Brimmer to come on the market, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re spending $5 million, $10 million, $20 million for a house on the Hill and you don\u2019t have any parking \u2014 at that point, for purchasing a spot, it becomes splitting hairs whether you pay $500,000 or $600,[000] or $700,000,\u201d he said.Camilo Fonseca can be reached at camilo.fonseca@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Apartment buildings need a lot of wood. And around here, wood mostly comes from Canada.",
        "content": "There are two main ingredients in cost of building housing: labor and materials. Here in New England especially \u2014 where builders have long wrestled with the cost of construction \u2014 the 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports instituted this week by President Trump will make the latter even more expensive.Much of the softwood lumber and mass timber that goes into apartment buildings in Massachusetts comes from Canada, as does fabricated steel and aluminum. While costs vary, it\u2019s typical for materials to make up between 40 and 50 percent of a construction budget \u2014 with anywhere from 6 to 12 percent of that coming from imported goods, said Mike Kearns, chief operating officer of the New England region for construction management firm Shawmut Design and Construction in Boston.New tariffs are likely to spark a domino effect on costs, he says. A 25 percent premium on Canadian lumber could prompt a run on domestic suppliers \u2014 a market that\u2019s already at maximum capacity, Kearns said \u2014 which will in turn likely bring those domestic prices up, and further extend an already stressed supply chain.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why it costs so much to build housing in Greater BostonAdvertisementBuilders are constantly on the hunt for ways to bring costs down, but the tariffs are likely to affect whether a project\u2019s economics work \u2014 and whether builders can build. Indeed, in the Northeast, lumber costs comprise typically 15 to 18 percent of the cost of building a new home.\u201cIt\u2019s always this balancing act,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cIf that value proposition isn\u2019t there, then that\u2019s when you could see something pause.\u201dKearns stressed, however, that the industry is \u201ca long way from seeing [tariffs] shut down work,\u201d and that there are ways to navigate costs.Still, any adjustment in the existing tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber results in almost universal groans among wood suppliers who watch the changes closely, said Paul Rogers, purchasing manager at Shepley Wood Products, a supplier with offices in Hyannis, Nantucket, and Wellfleet. If the price of Canadian lumber effectively goes up 25 percent, the price charged by American mills in turn \u201cgoes up in sympathy,\u201d Rogers said.\u201cEverybody follows the numbers,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what side of the border it\u2019s coming from.\u201dAdvertisementThe margin on lumber is already slim \u2014 \u201cin the single digits,\u201d Rogers said \u2014 and tariffs further limit a lumber supplier\u2019s ability to negotiate pricing. Canadian softwood lumber like spruce, pine, and fir have carried tariffs since 1980, said Shepley president Tony Shepley. Now those will go up even higher.An apartment building under construction in Everett in 2023.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFor development projects in the Northeast, architects will often specify that they want Canadian softwood lumber \u2014 both for how it\u2019s grown and how it survives in the Northeastern climate, said Rita Ferris, president of the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association, which represents independent lumber and building material suppliers from Maine to Washington, D.C.There\u2019s huge concern about tariffs further slowing development of residential housing, which has already faced huge cost pressures, Ferris said.\u201cWe just don\u2019t grow enough of our own to meet our own demands,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cWe totally get the goal of putting America first and having American workers and all of that. But if you can\u2019t supply yourself, it\u2019s really an extra burden.\u201dTariffs are of course nothing new to the construction industry. Prior presidential administrations have instituted tariffs on materials including steel and lumber, boosting their overall price, wrote Paul Brussow, president of Rider Levett Bucknall North America, in the firm\u2019s recent quarterly construction cost report. That report saw typical costs in Boston climb 5.4 percent over the last year, second only to Chicago among major markets.\u201cWhile tariffs have had an impact, it was nothing compared to what inflation has done in recent years,\u201d Brussow wrote in January. \u201cWhen coupled with inflation and labor shortages, this trifecta, in the last few years, has strained supply chains, raised construction costs, and affected project timelines.\u201dRelated: A 10,000-unit housing development at Suffolk Downs is on hold indefinitely. Here\u2019s why.AdvertisementAdditional tariffs \u201care more likely to exacerbate these challenges, particularly for metals, plastics, and essential construction materials, potentially adding thousands to the cost of residential and commercial projects,\u201d Brussow wrote.For Riverdale Mills, a Northbridge company that makes steel wire mesh used in products like fences and lobster traps, the new tariffs are a one-two punch of bad news. Riverdale buys much of its steel from Canada \u2014 and an additional 25 percent tariff on steel will kick in on March 12. So by mid-month, the company will be paying 50 percent more for its most important raw material.The company\u2019s chief executive, James Knott Jr., said Riverdale can\u2019t avoid the tariffs by buying American steel, because US steelmakers used the tariffs as an excuse to jack up their own prices. They didn\u2019t even wait for the tariffs to begin.\u201cBack in February, the domestic guys all raised their prices in advance of those tariffs,\u201d Knott said.Knott has no intention of switching to a US source.\u201cRather than buy from a domestic supplier, I\u2019m going to buy from my reliable supplier in Canada,\u201d said Knott, \u201cbecause all the prices are equal.\u201dIronically, Knott said that most of the US suppliers are foreign-owned, but his Canadian supplier is owned by a US firm.The tariffs will harm him in another way, said Knott. About 35 to 45 percent of Riverdale\u2019s products are exported. But since the tariffs have boosted his production costs, his exported steel mesh will be too expensive to compete on world markets.Meanwhile Shepley of Shepley Wood Products said he would hope for \u201ccommon sense and cooler heads\u201d to prevail.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s our mission as an industry to protect consumers, to not let housing get driven further out of reach, and to get things settled down,\u201d Shepley said. \u201cSo this was a bit of a shock to the system, but we\u2019ll hope that everybody pulls themselves together and gets this going.\u201dSteel and lumber, two major components in housing construction, both face substantial price increases amid 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada.David L.

Rockpoint and Wells Fargo both declined to comment, while a representative for Newmark did not respond.The complex spans about 853,000 square feet and is about 71 percent occupied, according to data from real estate firm CoStar Group.Related: One of Boston\u2019s skyline-defining towers is on the auction block \u2014 and expected to sell at a big discountThe pending sale comes amid a broad price reset for Boston\u2019s office market, with a growing roster of towers going up for sale for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shook up demand for office space. Real estate experts expect downtown properties could be worth between 40 percent and 60 percent less than they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and several recent sales bear out that thesis.Rockpoint Group has owned 75-101 Federal, at least in part, since 2015, when it purchased the conjoined offices for $326.5 million. Rockpoint sold a 50 percent stake in the buildings to Carr Properties in March 2020 \u2014 the very same week COVID was declared a national emergency \u2014 for about $185 more per square foot than it had paid five years previously. (Carr sold its stake back to Rockpoint last year for an undisclosed price). Also that week, Rockpoint and Carr finalized a $292 million mortgage with Wells Fargo, according to Suffolk County records, a mortgage with a maturity date of March 12, 2025.AdvertisementThe 75-101 Federal St. buildings have entrances on both Federal and Devonshire streets in downtown Boston. Here, one of the towers is reflected in the facade of 100 Federal St. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe brick and stone 75 Federal St. building dates to 1929 and was once described by the Boston Landmarks Commission as \u201cthe most elaborately decorative Art Deco skyscraper standing in Boston.\u201d The 31-story tower at 101 Federal St. was built as an adjoining office in 1988. The towers are connected by a block-long lobby linking their two entrances \u2014 one on Federal Street, the other on Devonshire Street \u2014 that was renovated in 2016.AdvertisementTwo real estate industry sources said Rockpoint and Wells Fargo are working closely on the sale and collectively decided to bring Newmark\u2019s capital markets team in to market the property. The 262,000-square-foot 75 Federal St. is 78 percent occupied, while the 591,000-square-foot 101 Federal St. is 64 percent occupied, according to CoStar.Related: Take a look at the first skyscraper proposed in downtown Boston since the pandemicIt\u2019s not clear for how much the towers could sell. Several recent deals have seen properties trade at big discounts, with significant implications for both the city\u2019s tax base and their owners\u2019 balance sheets.For example, after purchasing 179 Lincoln St. near South Station in January 2020 for $155.7 million, a Blackstone entity sold the five-story building to Boston\u2019s Synergy Investments last March for $76.5 million \u2014 a 51 percent price decline, according to research from Avison Young. Also last March, Synergy purchased 101 Arch St. in Downtown Crossing for $78 million \u2014 some 36 percent less than it sold for in 2005, and some $11 million less than the property had sold for in 2002.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "Developers working with the Boston Housing Authority have obtained $70 million in backing for the first phase of a long-planned redevelopment of South Boston\u2019s Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex, one of the oldest public housing projects in America.WinnCompanies and the BHA on Thursday said the financing would allow construction of a 112,000-square-foot building with 94 new apartments designated for low-income families who already live at the complex. Under a plan approved in 2023, Winn and the authority plan to raise /$2 billion over the next two decades to redevelop the entire 30-acre complex into a mixed-income, mixed-use property with 3,300 apartments, retail space, and a community center.The first phase, dubbed Building A, will also include a new Veterans Park with an accessible tot lot, bike lane, new trees, and reconfigured streets safer for pedestrians.Advertisement\u201cFor almost nine decades, Mary Ellen McCormack has been a cornerstone of Boston\u2019s commitment to affordable housing,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. \u201cToday, we take a major step forward in ensuring that this historic community remains a vibrant, inclusive home for generations to come.\u201dTenants have been involved in planning the entire project, according to Carol Sullivan, executive director of the Mary Ellen McCormack Task Force, a resident advocacy group. \u201cI am very proud of this partnership and cannot wait to see the smiles on the residents\u2019 faces when they move into their new, affordable homes,\u201d Sullivan said in a statement.An artist's rendering of the first building in the planned redevelopment of South Boston's Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex.The Architectural TeamWinnCompanies chief executive Gilbert Winn said the redevelopment project would be a model for similar projects across the country. \u201cThis first building jumpstarts an ambitious and inspired undertaking many years in the making that will ultimately give rise to a new mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood,\u201d Winn said in a statement.Ed Flynn, who represents the McCormack area on the City Council, said the redevelopment\u2019s new park and community center will offer improvements to benefit all South Boston residents. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to see it through to completion in 2026,\u201d Flynn said in an email.The project\u2019s financing, $62 million for the building and $8 million for infrastructure, came from a variety of sources including a construction loan from Bank of America, federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Energy Tax Credit equity from Bank of America, a tax-exempt bridge loan and tax-exempt first mortgage loan from MassHousing, and a subordinate loan from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund maintained by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing & Livable Communities.AdvertisementThe McCormack project, built during the Great Depression, currently includes 1,016 deeply subsidized apartments across 35 buildings.

        "content": "For the last six years, Annie Gordon has not gone a day without worrying about facing eviction or a huge rent increase.Now, she can relax.Developer Related Beal, with financial backing from the City of Boston, is buying the 347-unit Mattapan apartment complex where Gordon has lived for nearly 50 years and setting rents at affordable rates, putting an end to a lengthy saga that saw fixed-income tenants battle with a landlord that bought the property in 2018 and raised rents dramatically.\u201cThe feeling is overwhelming relief,\u201d said Gordon, who is 74. \u201cWhen I got the call with the news, I couldn\u2019t even believe it because we\u2019ve been fighting, trying to stay in our homes for so long. There\u2019s still a part of me that can\u2019t believe it. We fought so hard, and we actually won.\u201dAdvertisementSome tenants wept when they heard the news, Gordon said.\u201cThe toll this took on all of us,\u201d she said, \u201cwas huge.\u201dThe city is contributing more than $10 million to the purchase to guarantee affordable rents for all of the units, as well as protections against big rent increases, officials said at a press conference at Fairlawn Estates, as the property was known before it was purchased in 2018. Half of the units will be set at rents affordable to tenants making 60 percent of the area median income, or $78,360 for a household of two, and the other half will be set at 80 percent AMI. Related\u2019s deal with the city also caps annual rent increases at 2 percent a year.Related\u2019s affiliate, Related Affordable, would not say how much they are spending to purchase the 12-building property, but DSF Group paid $65 million to buy it in 2018.Boston\u2019s $10 million contribution is coming through its Acquisition Opportunity Program, which provides funding to community and housing groups to finance the purchase of market-rate housing to be maintained as permanently affordable. The groups behind the transactions can borrow against the city\u2019s contribution to obtain additional capital. In this case, the city said it was able to secure nine times its $10 million investment in private funds.At 347 units, Related\u2019s purchase of the Mattapan property is by far the largest such acquisition under the AOP. In 2022, the city helped finance the purchase of 36 small apartment buildings totaling 114 apartments in East Boston for affordable housing.Related: Leader of Mattapan tenant organization staves off eviction ... for nowAdvertisementThe program is part of a broader strategy by Mayor Michelle Wu that has seen the city pour hundreds of millions of pandemic recovery dollars into the construction and acquisition of affordable housing. By purchasing market-rate homes, the city can avoid the prohibitive costs it takes to build new affordable housing, while maintaining buildings in neighborhoods that are gentrifying rapidly.\u201cThe City of Boston is so proud to play a role in restoring Fairlawn as an affordable home, because for decades, these units were known that way: an affordable place to raise a family,\u201d Wu said Monday. \u201cOver the last few years especially, the rent here was hiked up ... and families were forced out of Fairlawn, out of Mattapan, and out of the city.\u201dNow, \u201cit\u2019s a new day,\u201d said city housing chief Sheila Dillon.Fairlawn was built in the 1960s off Mattapan\u2019s Bismarck Street, and it eventually became a community cornerstone because its cheap rents supported a community of longtime tenants, some of whom live on fixed incomes.Annie Gordon in her Mattapan apartment in June 2020.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffA few of those tenants spent years advocating for the addition of the Mattapan commuter rail stop, but when it was finally built, the apartment complex became attractive for prospective investors, Gordon said.That\u2019s when DSF bought the place. Rents immediately rose, in some cases, by hundreds of dollars. Many tenants couldn\u2019t afford the increases. Some left, but others stayed and fought, refusing to pay the increases and forming a tenant association with the help of tenant group City Life/Vida Urbana.Related: From 2022: In East Boston, a big move to keep renters in their homesAdvertisementLast year, DSF moved to evict Gordon, but a judge sided with her and let her stay.\u201cTenants have been traumatized by this,\u201d said Gabrielle Rene, the Mattapan community organizer for City Life. \u201cThis has been years of pain and struggle.\u201dThe saga at Fairlawn Estates highlights how vulnerable many residents of the city are to big rent increases, and why policy makers should prioritize protections for renters, said Gordon. People like Gordon would benefit directly from something like rent control, she said. And the city should also pass the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would require landlords to give tenants and housing groups the opportunity to purchase apartment buildings before they go up for sale on the private market, she said.Related\u2019s purchase is a rare victory for tenants in a city where apartment buildings change hands and rents soar frequently. Many of those sales have much different endings.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cI\u2019m grateful I get to stay in my home.\u201dResidents and advocates gave a round of applause during the announcement Monday.

Now a bead of sweat dribbles down the side of his forehead as he leads a trio of Northeastern University students in sweatpants back down four flights of creaking stairs and into a narrow basement.Roughly 10 minutes of searching and two calls to the building owner later, he finally discovers apartment 41A, at the bottom of an outdoor staircase that is hidden by a stand of bushes.Now, he can go to work.The current occupants of unit 41A sit awkwardly in their bedrooms as Macdonald leads the students around the basement apartment. The place smells vaguely of cat urine, and there is a network of pipes running across the ceiling that may, or may not, transport the building\u2019s sewage. Macdonald explains that if they want a three-bedroom for around $4,500, this is the most spacious option they\u2019ll find.Related: What\u2019s the rent where you live?

And after New York City outlawed tenant-paid broker fees last year, Boston and neighboring cities like Cambridge and Somerville constitute the only major urban center in the United States where renters are obligated to pay.Related: Renters hate to pay broker fees. Could this be the year those fees go away?That could soon change. Momentum is building for a law in Boston that would charge the fees to whoever hires the broker between the landlord and the renter, rather than allowing landlords to decide. Key legislators have signaled their support, and Governor Maura Healey has signed on.Some brokers have taken that recent push as an affront on their profession, and warn that the housing market cannot function without them. Their job, they say, is to find renters a good deal.Renters aren\u2019t so sure.\u201cWe\u2019re expected to pay this guy?\u201d one of the students remarked under his breath as Macdonald wandered through the Symphony building searching for apartment 41A.Macdonald has only been a broker for a few years, but he knows the business. He wears a navy suit bulky enough for a professional wrestler and oozes with the confidence of a 22-year-old, which he is. He crushes energy drinks instead of coffee, and the empty cans litter his car\u2019s floorboards. He fires off text messages at red lights, because, he says, \u201ctime is money.\u201d He hopes to parlay the money he makes leasing rentals into investment properties someday.Related: NYC is about to make landlords cover most brokers fees. Will Boston follow suit?Macdonald is the youngest broker at Jacob Realty on Newbury Street, one of a handful of brokerages run by Boston real estate mogul Demetrios Salpoglou. He lives with his parents in New Hampshire and starts his day around 7:30 a.m., after an hour\u2019s drive to work.AdvertisementOn a recent day, Macdonald settles into his desk near a drafty window overlooking Newbury Street. The room fills with chatter of brokers calling landlords and loudly drafting voice-to-text messages to prospective tenants. In a back room, there is a wall with thousands of keys to apartments Jacob helps rent.Thomas Macdonald sat at his desk in the Jacob Realty office on Newbury Street.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffMacdonald usually starts his days scanning Salpoglou\u2019s database of 215,000 rental units for apartments that are about to hit the market or that have lingered for awhile.This morning, he has spotted a couple of one-bedrooms in Allston that are about to hit the market, both renting for over $2,000 a month.\u201cCan you make the moving costs any easier?\u201d he asks the landlord on the phone, angling for a sweetener he can offer would-be tenants, like a break on the security deposit.The landlord says no.Real estate brokers have been around in Boston for as long as people have needed homes. Brokers say they serve an important purpose: helping people navigate the cutthroat housing market to find a home where they can build their lives. But they tend to work mostly on behalf of landlords in this housing market, where homes are in high demand. Those owners typically have enough leverage to push the broker fee off to their tenants.Sites like Zillow and Apartment List allow apartment-hunters to narrow down options, but in many cases, they can\u2019t tour a unit without interacting with a broker who has listed the place on a landlord\u2019s behalf.It can be a lucrative venture. Macdonald would not say how much he makes in a year, but its an eat-what-you-kill business. Most rental brokers\u2019 compensation consists entirely of fees they charge on apartment rentals, and it can vary widely from broker to broker. A successful broker can easily make six figures by leasing expensive apartments at an efficient clip. Others who lease just a few units a month make considerably less. There are thousands of brokers in Boston battling for the listings and leases of the city\u2019s more than 300,000 apartments. On Newbury Street alone, there are several dozen brokerages.Advertisement\u201cBrokers and leasing agents provide a valuable service, and we get compensated for those services,\u201d said Eric Shabshelowitz, vice president of the luxury real estate agency Cabot & Company. \u201cYears ago, it was landlords who paid the fee, but the market has changed.\u201dRelated: Governor Healey announces plan to eliminate renter-paid broker feesSome brokers focus on hawking cheaper rentals to Boston\u2019s flood of college students. Others work in specific neighborhoods.Rob Oteri, who founded the rental site JPRentals, focuses mainly on apartments in Jamaica Plain, where he lives. He said he tries to maintain personal relationships with landlords and works diligently with prospective renters to help them find the best place for them in their price range.When brokers do their job well, Oteri said, the fee shouldn\u2019t be quite so painful. But theirs is a volume business, and some brokers simply try to lease as many units as possible as quickly as possible. That leads to instances, he said, when brokers show up to lead apartment tours without ever having seen the unit.\u201cI certainly understand the frustration with some brokers who maybe have a \u2018turn and burn\u2019 mentality about the work,\u201d Oteri said. \u201cBut a good broker earns their money by working closely with tenants to get them the best deal.\u201dAdvertisementMacdonald\u2019s day has taken him into Allston, near Commonwealth Avenue, where he has picked up keys from one of the city\u2019s biggest student landlords, Alpha Management, so he can take photos of Alpha apartments that will soon come on the market.His first stop is a clean but tiny one-bedroom with a closet too thin for a person to stand in. It has nice natural light and a full kitchen.\u201cThis one will go fast,\u201d he says while taking note of the \u201cstandalone closet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Macdonald checks out an apartment in Allston before creating a listing on his brokerage's website.\n   \t\t(John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Macdonald on the phone in the Jacob Realty office.\n   \t\t\t\t (John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\n\nAs he drives toward his next stop, he defends the value of his profession.Finding apartments without brokers, he says, would be harder, because there would be no one to cultivate and centralize listings and organize tours. And his knowledge of the market helps him find renters the best deals, which is his top priority.\u201cIt\u2019s the free market,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it.\u201dRelated: Renters are vexed by broker fees.

        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nIf you\u2019re buying a condo, you\u2019ve probably reviewed the rules and regulations of the condominium association to confirm they don\u2019t conflict with your planned use of the property. But did you check out the association itself? Failing to ensure that the association\u2019s finances are healthy can lead to huge bills for unsuspecting unit owners.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that a buyer could have a special assessment in the thousands of dollars,\u2019\u2019 saidLinda Barrett, vice president of Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boston. \u201cShould the building\u2019s roof need to be replaced, you could end up with a very high special assessment if the association does not have good reserves.\u2019\u2019\nOwners of condominiums pay regular assessments, usually monthly or quarterly, to cover the operating expenses of the association, as well as reserves \u2014 funds stashed away for future capital projects. But condo associations also can charge unit owners special assessments for emergencies or unusual circumstances, such as damage to the building caused by a winter storm.\nThat\u2019s why Barrett always prepares her condo buyers beforehand. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure buyers not only review the condominium documents, but two years of the budget as well,\u2019\u2019 she said. When she writes an offer, she also includes a contingency allowing the buyer to review the minutes of association board meetings for the past two years. \u201cYou could read in the minutes from a year ago that there\u2019s a problem with the roof,\u2019\u2019 she said. That could signal that a special assessment is in your future.\nRelatedSticker shock: Special assessments can send condo costs even higher. What buyers should be asking.\n\nPrior to closing on a one-bedroom condominium in Boston\u2019s Seaport District two years ago, Anne Stemlar, a legal administrator in Boston, reviewed the association\u2019s financial statements. \u201cI was looking at the health of the organization and what kind of financial reserves they had,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nStemlar concluded that the association was well run, with healthy reserves, a capital budget, and a plan for improvements. But she had an advantage since she had owned two units previously and served on a condo association board of directors. First-time buyers should rely on their real estate agent and lawyer for help reviewing these documents. \u201cAsk a lot of questions, and make sure you come to a comfort level,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nIn addition to reviewing the rules and regulations of the association to ensure you won\u2019t be in violation if you own a large dog, drive a truck, or want to rent your unit, be sure to conduct the following due diligence on the financial stability of the association:\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the past two operating budgets, as well as two years\u2019 worth of board and annual meeting minutes. Be wary if assessments haven\u2019t increased over time; since the cost of goods and services have gone up, maintenance fees should have followed.\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the reserve study of the major capital components of the building, and make sure there are adequate funds to replace them on schedule.\n\u25a0\u00a0Ask questions. Dawn Bauman, senior vice president for government and public affairs at theCommunity Associations Institute, an industry group, said condo buyers should inquire about routine maintenance of the building, whether the board expects to increase assessments, and whether there is a current special assessment or one pending or imminent. Try to talk to the seller, the property manager, and board members.\n\u25a0\u00a0Be skeptical about the operating budget for new construction. Developers often subsidize the expenses of the association by paying costs such as landscaping or snow removal, so it\u2019s common for assessments to increase once the unit owners take control of the association.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t ignore insurance.Spencer M. Houldin, president of Ericson Insurance Advisors in Boston, suggested that condo buyers determine the insurance obligations of both the association and the unit owners. Typically, Houldin said, the association insures the building, while owners are responsible for everything inside their units. Have your insurance agent or lawyer review the association\u2019s insurance to make sure it\u2019s sufficient to rebuild the structure. All unit owners should carry anHO-6 policythat covers the interior of their units and liability.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t waive your right to review association financials. \u201cIt\u2019s a seller\u2019s market, and buyers are willing to overlook things like reserves because they\u2019re just happy they found a place and their offer was accepted,\u2019\u2019 saidMichael Merrill, a real estate and condominium law attorney in Boston. But even if you waive mortgage and inspection contingencies, be wary of waiving a budget review.\n\u201cThat way, when you do become an owner, you\u2019re not surprised by the amount of money you may have to put in to solve a problem,\u2019\u2019 Merrill said.\nRobyn A.

        "content": "By Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen it comes to online gardening trends and how they translate to reality, mileage can vary.\n\n\u201cChaos gardening\u201d lit upTikToklast year, its advocates tossing fistfuls of seed into soil \u2014 or even grass \u2014 while seeming to hope fora wildflower meadow. There are reasons that a planned approach can yield more reliable results: crowding plants can outcompete one another, and not all seeds will thrive in every yard placement. But for some who practice it in the Boston area, chaos gardening is more than an online trend: It\u2019s a longtime mindset they say has helped them maintain a more forgiving relationship with their spaces, easing up on their expectations and enjoying the garden on its own terms.\n\n\u201cI do have ideas for what I want to grow, but whatever works,\u201d said Dana Werbin, who gardens in Jamaica Plain. \u201cIf a seed grows there, that means it likes the conditions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Werbin\u2019s approach lacks design: It\u2019s just that the garden is, to a greater extent than some, also the designer. Their \u201cvolunteer\u201d tomatoes \u2014 ones that sprout from dropped seeds, tend to do better than planted seedlings, for example.\n\n\u201cI could make the decision to rip it up and plant it elsewhere, but it already made the decision that it likes where it is, so I\u2019m not gonna mess that up,\u201d they said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s going to give me good tomatoes.\u201d\n\nWerbin\u2019s description of their garden is a picture of both chaos and order. They don\u2019t know exactly where something will grow, but the garden will let them know. That\u2019s where they will find the scallions this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a percentage of, like, 70 percent chaos, 30 percent order,\u201d they said.\n\nFor Kris Engdahl, the decision opened up a neighborhood conversation.\n\n\nShe sees her chaos garden approach as an outcropping ofmilpa gardening, a sustainable and regenerative indigenous practice related to the \u201cthree sisters\u201d method of planting corn, beans, and squash together. Engdahl\u2019s Watertown front yard received a lot of street salt, which seemed to encourage crabgrass. So, she tore it up and tried flowers: roses, marigolds, and impatiens. But her interest turned to growing food, and she thought,why not?She replaced flowers with a range of vegetables and herbs. Sometimes she added more flowers. Sometimes, tricolor chard. She followed her whims, and soon the garden followed its own.\n\n\nAs  it evolved, the garden\u2019s proximity to the sidewalk attracted interest. Located a short walk to a community path, the foot traffic is frequent. The variety became a magnetic conversation-starter. A group of passersby, with her permission, harvested cilantro. A woman took chard and returned the next day with a delicious recipe she made with it.\n\nWith each season, different plantings would express themselves with more or less influence. One year, Engdahl\u2019s garden was dominated by dill and daikon (white radish). Sometimes pumpkins popped up; sometimes green beans would thrive.\n\nAnd while it can feel that way to Engdahl, to its admirers, the garden was not independent from its gardener. Last year, Engdahl said she fell behind on maintenance \u2014 stymied, as we all experience \u2014 by life and the heat wave. And even during these cold intermediate months, someone checked in.\n\n\u201cI had somebody on Sunday [ask]: \u2018How are you doing? We love looking at your garden. I was concerned about you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes the balance will seem off in some way, and Engdahl will correct it. One season\u2019s parsley, which produced months of winter broths, became next season\u2019s rabbit food.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will do something, and it will be wrong, but gardens are dynamic,\u201d she said. She plans to continue this year, following up on her practice of \u201cno dig\u201d gardening, adding her own homemade compost.\n\nGarden designerDemetra Tseckareshas found the chaos gardening mindset useful when responding to clients who are looking for lower maintenance. Meadows are a great fit for replacing a sunny lawn. Tseckares will hand-seed the area, but is careful to select intentionally, avoiding pre-sold mixes that can often include invasive or aggressive plant species.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get people to understand what a beautiful garden looks like in a different way, because these super neat, super tidy \u2026 cleaned-up gardens that don\u2019t allow a single leaf or a single stem to stand are dead zones, they kill an entire generation,\u201d Tseckares said of the insects that may use stems and leaves for habitat, supporting other parts of the wildlife population.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a more sustainable approach \u2014 including financially.\n\n\u201cYou can change it every year, or it will just do its own thing,\u201d she said, noting that gardeners can harvest seeds at the end of the season for next year\u2019s plantings.\n\nWerbin\u2019s next season, like many gardeners, will begin well before the last frost. Using a small greenhouse, they will start seedlings during the cold season. But they also will practice experimental sowing with a packet of their own mixed seeds as an intentional surprise, to see what comes up.\n\nNot every experiment is fruitful. Last year, Werbin nurtured a plant they thought was ginger. It turned out to be grass.\n\n\u201cI was giving so much love to this weed, thinking that it was going to turn into something, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d they said.\n\nBut care and forgiveness are never wasted. Now Werbin, who has a professional horticulture background, is studying for a career pivot into nursing.\n\n\u201cCultivating a rapport with your patients is just like getting the soil ready,\u201d she said. Their approach to gardening required openness and nonjudgmental thinking. They talk to their plants. And they are carrying that practice into their nursing study.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the same student nurse, if I didn\u2019t have that experience,\u201d said Werbin.\n\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\n\n\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "Wishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.",
        "content": "By Ann Carrns, New York Times Service\n\nWishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.\n\nBut many people don\u2019t realize myriad programs offer grants or loans to help home buyers come up with the necessary funds. \u201cThere are tons of programs to assist them,\u201d said Deatra Kemp, an advocate for first-time home buyers in Milwaukee.\n\nThe programs can ease some of the daunting numbers behind buying a house. The median price of a home has risen to more than $400,000, meaning the once-traditional 20 percent down payment \u2014 an amount paid in cash toward the purchase of a home, in addition to the amount borrowed for a mortgage \u2014 would be about $80,000. And typical house prices are significantly higher in some parts of the country like Massachusetts. The Warren Group reported Tuesday that the median sales price for a single-family home in the state hit $615,000 in December, a year-over-year jump of 11.1 percent. The median condo price in Massachusetts was $521,750, a 5 percent increase.\n\nEven putting down 5 percent to 10 percent is a stretch because rising rents have made it harder for people to save, said Teig Whaley-Smith, chief alliance executive for the Community Development Alliance, a nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes affordable homeownership as a path to racial equity. \u201cFor working families,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s next to impossible.\u201d\n\nPlus, increasing mortgage interest rates, which drive up monthly costs, don\u2019t help. Last week, rates fora 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose above 7 percentfor the first time since May, according toFreddie Mac, the federally backed mortgage finance giant.\n\nSonu Mittal, senior vice president and head of the single-family acquisitions division at Freddie Mac, said that outside of high prices and interest rates, which consumers can\u2019t control, raising a down payment \u201ccontinues to be the No. 1 barrier to homeownership.\u201d\n\nBut down-payment assistance options can help buyers come up with the necessary cash. When combined with loan programs that allow buyers to put less money down \u2014 as little as 3 percent of the home\u2019s purchase price, in some cases \u2014 the help can make buying a home a reality.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible in some cases to put no money down. Two federal government programs offer zero percent down-payment loans to borrowers who meet specific criteria. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers full financing for veterans and those on active military duty, and the Department of Agriculture guarantees zero percent down-payment loans in rural areas.\n\n\u201cTwenty-percent down is a myth,\u201d Kemp said. The typical down payment for first-time buyers in 2024 was 9 percent, according to theNational Association of Realtors. Yet the notion that higher down payments are needed persists. As a result, many people of modest means don\u2019t even consider the notion of owning a home, said Kemp, vice president of programs atActs Housing, a nonprofit that provides financial coaching and other services to help renters become homeowners.\n\nStill, finding the right assistance program isn\u2019t easy.A 2023 report from the Urban Institute,a nonprofit research group, identified more than 1,600 government programs across the country designed to help with down payments. Some are offered by the federal government, others by state housing finance agencies or county and local governments. Community-funded organizations and even commercial lenders may also offer help.\n\nMost, but not all, programs serve first-time buyers, and most set income limits for borrowers \u2014 typically based on the median income in the home\u2019s area. The dizzying assortment of programs, which have varying criteria and geographic restrictions, can make it challenging to identify and apply for available help.\n\n\u201cHome buyers don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Ashley Moore, community lending manager withChase Home Lendingin Houston.\n\nSome programs offer grants, which don\u2019t need to be repaid, but most offer help in the form of a low- or no-interest second mortgage, meaning there is additional debt on the home. Payments on the loans, however, are often deferred, meaning you don\u2019t have to start paying them back right away, and the loans may be forgiven if you remain in the home for a certain period of time \u2014 often five years.\nMore on home buyingMore home buyers are asking relatives for down payment helpMedian down payment tops $105k for metro Boston home buyersSpring House Hunt: Why you don\u2019t need 20% down to buy a home\nJung Hyun Choi, principal research associate for the Urban Institute\u2019s housing finance policy center, said borrowers may combine benefits of several different down-payment programs, a practice sometimes called \u201cstacking,\u201d to come up with the necessary funds. But it can take time and effort to find and apply for various programs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty complicated,\u201d she said, and can drag out the buying process.\n\nGroups like Acts Housing seek to help borrowers identify the right programs and often find that borrowers are eligible for more than one. \u201cWe love to stack,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nActs Housing recently worked with a buyer who was able to get $19,500 in down-payment assistance from a combination of grants from federal and private lenders and a city program, she said. The buyer put down less than $700 out of pocket at closing for a home in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cGet all the grants you deserve,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave any money on the table.\u201d\n\nThe borrower, Latoya Myrick, 44, who works in community services, said the assistance had enabled her to buy a duplex for about $200,000, realizing a longtime goal of owning her own home. She had tried before, she said, but didn\u2019t have enough for a down payment. She closed on Jan. 6 and will soon move in. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d\n\nOther resources are emerging to help home buyers find down-payment assistance. Freddie Mac in late 2023 began offering a free online search tool,DPA One,to help lenders and housing counselors match eligible borrowers with down-payment help.\n\n\u201cLoan officers may not even know there is a program available,\u201d Mittal said. \u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t miss those opportunities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say how many homes have been purchased because of the new offering, Mittal said, but the tool is gaining traction. About 7,000 loan officers use the tool, which now has information on about 800 programs across 50 states and the District of Columbia. (Home buyers can try DPA One, but it\u2019s mainly intended for professionals.)\n\nAnother option isDown Payment Resource, an online search tool. Borrowers enter details about themselves and the type of home they want and can get information about programs for which they may be eligible.\n\nYou can also contact your state housing finance authority or work with a housing counseling agency certified by the federalDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentto learn about available programs. You can search on the HUD website for agencies in your area.\n\n\nWill using a down-payment assistance program cause the interest rate on my loan to be higher?\n\nSome predatory lenders may charge a higher rate to borrowers using assistance programs, Kemp said. When that happens, counselors at certified housing agencies can work with buyers to find lenders who won\u2019t penalize borrowers using down-payment help, she said.\n\nCan I use a family gift to help with a down payment?\n\nLenders may allow gifts from close family members to be included as part of a down payment. In 2024, 8 percent of homebuyers (and 21 percent of first-time buyers) said they had used a gift from a relative or friend, according to the National Association of Realtors. You may need to provide a letter signed by the donor to document that the money doesn\u2019t need to be repaid, according to credit bureauExperian.\n\nDo private lenders offer assistance with down payments?\n\nSome do. Chase, for instance, offers grants of up to $7,500 in eligible areas, including federally identified neighborhoods with majority Black, Hispanic, or Latino populations, that can be used toward a down payment or to reduce a home loan\u2019s interest rate or closing costs.

The price? $7,495,000.\nThe legendary actress,who died in 1969, rented the home while her daughter,Liza Minnelli, performed at theCape Cod Melody Tent. Minnelli also worked as an assistant at the legendary venue as a teen, where she was responsible for changing scenery, the startold the Cape Cod Timesin 2007.\n\u201cIt was funny because Judy called my grandfather one day, less than a day before Liza was performing, and said: \u2018Bill, my daughter is very nervous.

In the foyer, hardwood floors and a blue-carpeted staircase greet you.\nTo the right, you\u2019ll find a 244-square-foot sitting room with three windows and a fireplace that\u2019s boarded.\nTo the left is the living room, a 580-square-foot space with white beamed ceilings and a stone fireplace. Across the room, a bay window offers a sunny spot on a built-in seat. The living room flows naturally into the 277-square-foot dining room, where dark beamed ceilings run overhead and a set of doors leads back out to the porch, the perfect place for taking in the sunset after dinner.\nStep through a door to the bright eat-in kitchen (329 square feet), where a small room to the left serves as a pantry and laundry area. In the kitchen, you\u2019ll find stainless steel appliances and natural stone countertops surrounded by white cabinetry. There\u2019s a double window over the sink.\nA second door offers direct access to the foyer, while a third door reveals a roomy, but unheated, back hallway that continues into a utility and storage room (477 square feet). A half bath completes this level. Only two of these bedrooms are included in the overall bedroom count.\nThe hallway also provides access to a back staircase you can take to four bedrooms and a full bath with a claw-foot tub. This part of the home is not heated.\nBack in the main portion of the home, the main staircase ascends to a bedroom level that holds the primary suite, four other bedrooms ranging from 178 to 268 square feet, and three full bathrooms.\nIn the primary bedroom, expansive windows provide views of the water hitting the beach from the 432-square-foot room. \u00a0Blue carpeting runs throughout the space, which has double closets.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nAfter six years of fighting, residents of the Fairlawn Estates in Mattapan can breathe a sigh of relief: their market-rate homes will permanently become affordable.\n\u201cBy securing these homes as permanently affordable, we are continuing our efforts to make Boston a home for everyone and ensuring that families can continue to live and thrive in their neighborhood without the fear of being priced out,\u201d Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement.\nIn anannouncementon Monday, the city said it invested $10 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to support Related Beal\u2019s acquisition of the Fairlawn Estates, permanently converting the housing to affordable homes.\nThe investment is also part of the city\u2019sAcquisition Opportunity Program, which helps developers buy and preserve existing affordable housing.\nThe acquisition was possible through city funds, private investment, and loans. The newly created Boston Acquisition Fund provided a nearly $1 million commitment.\nThe Fairlawn Estates comprises 12 apartment buildings and a leasing office on Fairlawn Avenue, Cummins Highway, and Bismarck Street.\nThe release said the Flatley Companies constructed the complex in the 1960s, and it was known for its affordability. However, in 2018, that all changed when the long-awaited commuter rail stop opened across from the apartment complex. The building was sold to an investor group, and the property was rebranded as SoMa at the T. Residents faced increased rents, which resulted in evictions.\nThe new owner, Related Affordable, an affiliate of Related Beal, has committed to permanently restricting all 347 units to affordable housing.\n\u201cAffordable housing is core to Related\u2019s DNA, and we are thrilled to provide a more sustainable living solution in such an important, transit-oriented location in Mattapan,\u201d said Kimberly Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal.\nThe release said Related Affordable plans to invest $6.4 million in immediate repairs and building upgrades, including roof replacements, balcony repairs, and appliance upgrades in all apartments. Related Affordable will also focus on making the buildings more energy efficient.\nThe investment will ensure that half the apartments are for households earning no more than 60% of the Area Median Income, while the other half are for those earning no more than 80%.\nThe agreement with Related also limits rent increases to no more than 2% per year and provides ongoing support for households with housing vouchers.\nThe conversion to affordable housing follows years of advocacy and organizing by Fairlawn tenants, City Life/Vida Urbana, and neighbors in Mattapan.\n\u201cThe constant stress of facing huge rent increases and eviction weighed on us every day over the past six years, and it wasn\u2019t right \u2014 but we want people to know that housing is a human right and we can win the homes we deserve,\u201d said Betty Lewis, of the Fairlawn Tenant Association. \u201cThis is a community victory won by neighbors working together.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nBaby boomers own a significant chunk of the housing stock in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t count on that changing to solve the housing shortages anytime soon.\n\nBaby boomers \u2014 those from age 58 to 76 \u2014 accounted for nearly 39 percent of the homeowner pool statewide in 2023, according to Redfin\u2019s most recent data.\n\nNationwide, about 21 million homes are \u201cempty nests\u201d \u2014 those with at least three bedrooms and occupied by residents 55 and up with no children at home,according to Zillow.That has the potential to more than make up for the estimated 4.5 million unit national home shortage.\n\nBut for all the talk of a pending \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of generational wealth \u2014 and housing \u2014 transfer to younger demographics, experts caution this won\u2019t be a flash flood of supply.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in our industry have been thinking about this idea that there would be maybe a big wealth transfer, that maybe there would be a lot of baby boomers [with homes] coming on the market at some point,\u201d saidOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. \u201cBut unfortunately, our research shows that there\u2019s just not enough of those older families.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers also are staying in their homes longer than ever, meaning you likely shouldn\u2019t expect a sudden jolt of new supply:40 percent of American baby boomershave lived in their current homes for at least 20 years, according to Redfin.\n\nRedfin also noted empty-nest baby boomers owned 25 percent of large homes (those with at least three bedrooms) in Greater Boston in 2022 \u2014 compared to millennials with children owning just 12.5 percent of the supply.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s keeping these older homeowners parked in their current abodes rather than downsizing? Money talks, but the high cost of moving \u2014 especially when it pertains to higher mortgage rates compared to what they might have on their existing homes \u2014 has caused many to decide not to leave their longtime homes.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of baby boomersnationally planned to age in place, an increasingly standard plan for older homeowners, according to Redfin.\n\nEmpty nests would need to be more concentrated in markets with the largest housing shortages \u2014 like Greater Boston \u2014 to make a dent in home prices. But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn the local market, Zillow notes there are 281,773 empty nests, or about 14 percent of the local housing supply. That\u2019s slightly less than the 16 percent national average of empty nests found coast to coast.\n\n\u201cBoston is a younger place, and there\u2019s just not enough of these older homes available, even if all of them came on the market someday,\u201d Divounguy said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just empty nesters occupying larger homes that\u2019s driving some of the supply shortage.\n\n\u201cMany baby boomers have had very prosperous careers, and that has led to many of them owning multiple properties, whether it be that they own a primary residence and secondary for vacationing, or perhaps a primary and then also in owning investment properties as part of their portfolio,\u201d saidSarah Gustafson, president of theMassachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cWith that, they\u2019re taking up so much of that available inventory, it\u2019s exacerbating the housing shortage that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nMany older homeowners just prefer to stay where they are.\n\n\u201cThe most common reasons [for baby boomers deciding to age in place] are that people like where they live and that there is no good alternative for them,\u201d saidChen Zhao, economics research lead at Redfin. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it boils down to.\u201d\n\nThink of the pending generational wealth and housing supply transfer more like a trickle than a tsunami, according to the Redfin team. Higher mortgage rates and home prices increase the supply shortage in a market like Greater Boston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long while coming,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cBoston has probably one of the tighter home markets and is one of the places where it seems like the market is frozen.\u201d\n\nThere are a mix of policy levers a region like Greater Boston can pull to help younger generations with housing accessibility and affordability. Governor Maura Healey\u2019sUnlocking Housing Production Commissionexamined the state\u2019s housing shortage and notedsingle-family-only zoning is a key obstacle, blocking more housing construction.\n\nThe commission recommended eliminating single-family zoning across the state in a move that wouldn\u2019t ban single-family homes from being constructed. Instead, the measure would prohibit municipal governments from blocking many multi-unit housing proposals on residential lots.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not to wait and hope for existing homes to come on the market. It\u2019s to help the builders build more housing,\u201d Zillow\u2019s Divounguy said. \u201cBoston happens to be one of the more restrictive markets in terms of building restrictions. It means loosening some of these building restrictions in the metro area and allowing for more construction.\u201d\n\nThere also are much longer-term solutions to some of the housing shortage. Baby boomers and millennials are larger generations, and that presents a multigenerational need for housing.\n\nBut declining birth rates in the US and expected lower immigration rates also can mean decreased housing demand in the distant future \u2014 emphasis on distant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen immediately, but at some point this does make a difference for housing demand and our housing shortage,\u201d Zhao said.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nTaylor Halldeparted theBruinsfor theChicago Blackhawksback in 2023, but the hockey player\u2019s Fort Point condo is up for grabs. The four-bedroom, 3.5-bath unit is listed for $4,099,000.\nBuilt at the turn of the last century, 355 Congress St. was originally known asTremont Electric Lighting Co.At the time, you would find the company\u2019s machine shop on the first floor, where they built electric meters and motors. The lamp department was on the second floor, according to historical documents. (These days, the brick beauty of a building is better known as the home ofLucky\u2019s Lounge.)\nDespite its historic bona fides,Unit 601exudes a modern sensibility.\nStep inside the building\u2019s secure entrance, equipped with aButterflyMXaccess-control system. Steps head up to the lobby floor, where you\u2019ll find the mailroom to the left. Take the historic elevator to the fifth floor.\nThe foyer is on the bedroom level. Closets on both sides await your boots, coats, and hockey bag. Tired from pond skating? There\u2019s a bedroom straight ahead. The nearly 114-square-foot space does not have a closet but could easily function as a home office or den.\nBack in the hallway, there\u2019s a glass staircase on the left and a long hallway that features utilities, storage, and laundry. There\u2019s also a full bathroom with a tub and access to a 193-square-foot bedroom that boasts stunning views of the brick-filled neighborhood. Next door to that is a slightly bigger bedroom (198 square feet) that features double-door closets and beautiful views of the neighborhood and Farnsworth Street. The en-suite bath has a glass-enclosed shower and an entrance from the hallway.\nClimb the glass staircase to the living level, which offers 13-foot ceilings and an open floor plan that the staircase cuts in half. A few steps down, and you\u2019re in the 593-square-foot living room. Grab a seat around the fireplace, which is surrounded by Carrara marble and has wood features above it around a built-in television. Floating shelves sit on the left and right, while a bar area with refrigerated drawers is ready for you to stock up for entertaining.\n\u201cYou can see the Fort Point sign from the living room window,\u201d\u00a0 saidAmy Carlisle, lead\u00a0of The Carlisle Group at Compass, who has thelisting. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pretty view.\u201d\nFrom the living room, a door opens to a long, narrow deck. That deck lines the outside of the condo and leads to the 1,022-square-foot main deck, with direct access to the 200-square-foot primary bedroom suite. The suite\u2019s 86-square-foot walk-through closet comes with built-ins and ushers you through to a stunning primary bath that\u2019s home to dual vanities, a shower, and a motorized toilet.\nThe dining room (134 square feet) is also off the hallway. It features sliding doors that open out to the main deck. The dining area is off the 320-square-foot kitchen, which has an integrated refrigerator and high-gloss white cabinets. A gray stone island anchors the space, which has same pale hardwood flooring that runs throughout the home. There\u2019s also a half bathroom off that room.\nClimb the glass stairs up another flight to the condo\u2019s beautiful roof deck, which faces the harbor. The 315-square-foot space offers views that stretch into the Financial District.\nThe condo, which a developer transformed in 2018, has a $677 monthly homeowners association fee. It comes with a parking spot behind the building. A second parking spot is available for rent at the Farnsworth Garage for $500 a month. The building allows pets, according to the write-up on the Multiple Listing Service.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "By ANDRE MUGGIATI, Associated Press\n\nWELLFLEET, Mass. (AP) \u2014A luxury home that had been on the verge of tumbling into Cape Cod Baydue to erosion has been demolished.\n\nA potential collapse of the 5,100-square-foot home threatened oyster beds in nearby Wellfleet Harbor, but a dispute over its removal had left it teetering on the edge of a sandy bluff for months. But on Monday, heavy machinery rolled in to remove the house piece by piece, with trucks carrying it away. By Tuesday, only its concrete slab, chimney and a generator remained.\n\n\u201cOn one side, it is sad because it was a beautiful house that became a landmark in that place,\u201d said John Cobler, a member of the Wellfleet Environmental Commission. \u201cOn the other, I am happy that it is gone. It is a great relief for our town and for our environment.\u201d\nA luxury house is close to tumbling into Cape Cod Bay. Will anyone stop it?\nCobler said attorneys for owner John Bonomi filed a request with the town last week to remove the house. An attorney for Bonomi declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nThe house was built in 2010 on the bay side of the Cape Cod peninsula. Its original owners sought permission in 2018 to build a seawall to stave off erosion. The commission rejected the seawall out of concern for unintended effects on the beach and how water carries nutrients in the bay. They also questioned whether it would save the house.\n\nIn 2019, Bonomi, a New York attorney, bought the house for $5.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the erosion advanced. A report prepared for Wellfleet last year estimated the house would fall down the bluff within three years, potentially sending debris into a harbor where shellfish farmers grow the town\u2019s namesake oysters, and the environment commission asked Bonomi for a plan to remove the house.\n\nJust a week before the demolition, strong winds battered the cape for three days, exposing more of the home\u2019s concrete pillars.\n\nAn attorney for Bonomi had told the commission at its January meeting that the house had been sold to a salvage company that would not fund removal of the house. But the town\u2019s conservation agent noted at the time that no transfer of deed had been recorded, and a check of records Tuesday also found no record of sale.\nSign up for the Today newsletterGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

Ellement, The Boston Globe\n\n639 Corea Road, Gouldsboro, Maine\n\n$799,000\n\nStyleContemporary\n\nYear built1950; updated 2024\n\nSquare feet2,500\n\nBedrooms3\n\nBaths2 full\n\nSewer/WaterPrivate\n\nTaxes$2,874 (2025)\n\nIt\u2019s found on the rugged coastline near the town of Gouldsboro, Maine, and in the backyard there are views ofSchoodic Peninsulaharbor, where commercial fish and lobster boats still sail out to the Gulf of Maine.\n\nWhat we are talking about is pink granite, and large chunks of it are formed into a fire circle in the backyard of this 2,500-square-foot home in a town that boasts five distinct villages and 55 miles of coastline within its boundaries.\n\n\nBut before sharing stories around a backyard fire, take a walk through this 75-year-old home that was fully updated in 2024. From the driveway, walk past the deck overlooking the sloping front yard to reach the front door at the top of three stone steps.\n\nIt opens into the living room that features a black gas fireplace, and the updated white oak engineered hardwood throughout the house. There are views of the town and harbor.\n\n\nTo the left, a central hallway connects to the rest of the rooms on this level. The first to appear is the fully updated kitchen on the left. It\u2019s a study in white, black, and glistening silver.\n\nThe countertops on the large island and the counters are white quartz flecked with gray. The cabinets are white, but the faucet and the island are black. The range is fueled by gas, and the appliances are stainless steel. A slider connects to the backyard, and the ceiling is knotty planks. Beyond the kitchen is a dining area with access to the front deck amid three large double-hung windows.\n\n\nOn the right side of the house is the first full bath, which has a single vanity sink with a quartz top. The shower has a clear glass door with a gray subway tile backsplash.The flooring in both the shower and the bathroom is stone mosaic tile,with radiant heat below the walking space. There is also a large closet and laundry room with space for full-size appliances.\n\n\nCompleting this floor is a large bedroom in the rear of the house.\n\nThe primary bedroom is on the second floor in the left corner of the home, providing scenic views from the double-hung windows on two exterior walls. The interior wall is decorated with white shiplap. The entrance to the bathroom is framed by wood timbers and the door itself is a barn-style slider.\n\n\nThe full bath \u2014 shared with another bedroom \u2014 features a white oval soaking tub and a double vanity with gold faucets, a white quartz countertop, and a Navy blue wood cabinet. The shower is behind gold-framed glass and has a stone mosaic tile floor and a gray tile backsplash. There is a square rain shower head. This bathroom also has radiant heat flooring.\n\n\nOn the other side is another bedroom, now outfitted with a pair of twin beds. There are double-hung windows on two exterior walls.\n\nThe third floor can be used as a rec room, but is currently set up with two twin beds along with four comfortable chairs. The walls have shiplap molding and two windows in the corner look out to the harbor.\n\nThe basement has a dirt floor and storage space.\n\nAccording to the listing agent,Tacy Ridlonof Better Homes & Gardens The Masiello Group in Ellsworth, Maine, Gouldsboro does not restrict rentals in a town where the summer population doubles to about 3,400.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nThe Bay State might have the misfortune of being labeled \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d but experts point to how it\u2019s not as bad as itcouldbe from a property tax standpoint. That distinction goes to New Jersey \u2014 at least this year, anyway.\n\nStill, Massachusettshome buyersshouldn\u2019t be caught off guard by property tax increases, which can add even more financial stress to homeownership.\n\n\u201cOver time, property taxes have inched up, but I think it\u2019s really about how the counties and the state manage their financials,\u201d saidEllen Steinfeld, senior executive vice president of consumer lending and payments at Berkshire Bank.\n\nProperty taxes are what homeowners pay to their city or town based on the assessed value of their home and the municipal tax rate. This tax rate varies by community and largely depends on a municipality\u2019s financial status and spending levels.\n\nIf you average these tax rates,the effective property tax rateacross Massachusetts is 1.14 percent on every assessed dollar \u2014 making Massachusetts the 18th highest of any US state and the District of Columbia, according toRocket Mortgage.\n\nNew Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the country. Illinois, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut round out the top five, respectively.\n\nPlus,a study the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership and the Donahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, released Monday ranked the state 46th (from strongest to weakest) in the nation when it comes to state and local tax collections per capita as a competitive weakness.\nMore Fall House HuntThe fix is in. Shoppers flock to buy homes that need work.All the world\u2019s a stage, so make your home its starThe median home price in Mass. in July was $650k. Here\u2019s what that gets you now.\nRates can vary significantly within the state itself.\n\nAlmost one-third of Massachusetts municipalities have split property tax rates between commercial and residential dwellings, according to thePioneer Institute of Public Policy Research, a maneuver some states use to offset the high cost of housing with a reduced tax burden. This often means municipalities with higher commercial bases can have lower residential taxes.\n\nBucolic Wendell \u2014 with a municipal property tax rate of $22.15 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 had the highest rates in the state in fiscal 2024, according to theMassachusetts Department of Revenue. Chilmark on Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2014 at $2.12 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 has the lowest. Some communities like Boston also offer a residential tax exemption that \u201creduces your tax bill by excluding a portion of your residential property\u2019s value from taxation. Last fiscal year, the residential exemption will [have] saved qualified Boston homeowners up to $3,610.53 on their tax bill.\u201d\n\nCommercial and industrial property owners paid 58 percent of all property taxes in 2022 compared to 42 percent of residential property owners, per the Pioneer Institute report. But there is concern this balance could shift more toward residential property owners amid higher vacancy rates in commercial buildings following the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into property taxes, but generally, I don\u2019t see higher property taxes as a bad thing,\u201d saidDaryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cThe downside of having property taxes very low is that it makes housing a more appealing financial investment, and then that can crowd out first-time home buyers if investors are buying homes simply because it has favorable taxes.\u201d\n\nFurther, it\u2019s important for homeowners to keep tabs on how frequent towns reassess property values to avoid sticker shock.\n\n\u201cSome municipalities do their assessments frequently, so the changes aren\u2019t as big,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cSome will do assessments more sporadically, and then people can get pretty big shocks when they go and see how much their home has been reassessed for.\u201d\n\nA reassessment doesn\u2019t have to be the final verdict, however. You can contest an assessment by filing an abatement application with your local tax assessor\u2019s office for potential overvaluation. Further, senior citizens are eligible for property tax credits and exemptions.\n\nMassachusetts has a safeguard against municipalities going overboard with hikes: Proposition 2\u00bd prevents a town from raising the rate more than 2.5 percent a year without a majority override vote.\n\nThere was an expectation coming out of the pandemic thatoverride votes would increase amid rising inflationand dwindling government relief funds to cover budget shortfalls. That appears to be precisely what happened.\n\nProp 2\u00bd override votes are becoming increasingly common: Nearly 100 such votes have taken place in the past 18 months \u2014 the most seen in more than a decade, the Globe\u2019s James Vaznisreported in July. About two-thirds of them were successful.\n\nPerhaps the nickname \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d at least when it comes to property tax hikes on the horizon, isn\u2019t such an overstatement after all.\n\nSend comments to[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress newsletterGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

It was built in 2001.\nPerched at the beginning of the street behind a fieldstone wall overlooking the Dedham Country & Polo Club, a short flight of steps up to the front door brings guests into the stunning two-story foyer under a sparkling chandelier. Boasting an open floor plan, it features hardwood floors and custom woodwork running throughout the dramatic space.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nThat stubborn, dirt-flecked pile of snow in the shady corner of my garden serves as an unwelcome reminder of the winter season, now only a few weeks from coming to an official end. Sunshine and warmer temperatures this past week have lifted my spirits nearly as much as seeing the first of the blooming snowdrops I planted last year push through the earth. Students of nature will have observed the buds swelling on trees and shrubs, while the bud scales of early blooming willows shyly reveal their silvery, furry flower buds underneath.\n\nWe are on the cusp of spring returning to New England. Gardeners recognize the invigorating energy, the drive to return outside that spring awakens within us. Whether you have started seeds in your basement, greenhouse, or kitchen, the excitement is palpable.\n\nMy thoughts now turn to bed preparation, clean up of winter debris, and cutbacks of last year\u2019s stems. Here are a few things to consider as you get ready for spring cleanup.\n\nLeaving stems standing over winter has loads of benefits, from protecting the crown of the plant, providing habitat and nesting for bees and other wildlife, as well as extending the aesthetic interest of your garden. But now that winter is almost over, when is it safe to cut those stems back? A good rule of thumb is to wait until you observe flying insects in your garden. In our area, that\u2019s usually from late March into early April, depending on the weather trends.\n\nFor mulch, I like to leave as much leaf litter in the beds as possible in the fall while collecting leaves from the lawn into a pile. If I have time and motivation, I may run them over with the lawn mower to chop them smaller. That pile of composting leaves is now a great source to top-dress any sections of planting beds blown bare by winter winds. Smaller pieces are easy to work with around the emerging stems, leaves, and blossoms of spring bulbs and perennials.\n\nFor some tips on bed preparation, let us turn to a reader question:\n\nQ.This spring, I plan to move a 6-foot-long by 3-foot-deep bed of hydrangeas about 4 feet behind their current location. The new location currently is overrun with various wild woodland plants/weeds. The new location is lower than the current bed, and I will fill it with about 3 to 4 feet of new loam. Once transplanted, I will add about 3 inches of mulch.\n\nMy question is: Should I use a herbicide to kill current, unwanted undergrowth before filling with new loam? Will using a herbicide create a risk to the transplanted hydrangeas? Will simply adding 4 to 4 feet of new loam on top of existing wild plants stifle any new growth without applying herbicide?\n\nKevin,Natick\n\nA.The tenets ofintegrated pest management(IPM) teach us to approach pest or weed management in an environmentally sensitive manner. The first step is to observe and learn about your problem. Our reader has identified unwanted plants that may threaten his plans to establish a new bed. Before reaching for the herbicide, let\u2019s consider a few nontoxic solutions that would solve the problem without using chemicals.\n\nThe next step in this scenario would be to consider a physical barrier to smother the unwanted plants. Given the amount of loam planned to be added on top, I would put down a layer of cardboard first before the loam is piled on. While the herbicide might not impact the hydrangeas, it will affect the beneficial life found in the loam. Soil is alive with countless organisms that help break down and repackage organic matter into forms that plants can use. Keeping your soil healthy will keep your garden growing abundantly.\n\nIf you believe the weeds to be especially tenacious, you can escalate the solution to nontoxic herbicides that use active ingredients like vinegar, citric acid, or botanical oils.Arbico Organicsis a great source for these types of products. Organic herbicides are safe to use around people and pets and will not affect the soil kingdom.\n\nAfter exhausting all other alternatives, then and only then, consider turning to chemical herbicides. The IPM approach ensures that we continue to move away from the days of blanket spraying your plants to the use of organic products delivered with very targeted applications using the smallest amount needed. Happy spring, my fellow gardeners, I hope to see you over the garden gate soon!\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

There are two double-hung windows on the two exterior walls, hardwood flooring, and an antique period medallion as the central light fixture. The current owner has placed a table with seating for six. On the right side, there is a wide pass-through into the kitchen, and at the end of the room is a custom-built China cabinet that is original to the 145-year-old home.\n\n\nKitchens are considered the heart of the home, and this iteration absolutely qualifies.

There is a large closet and double-hung windows on three exterior walls. The flooring is hardwood.\n\n\nThe second bedroom is 165 square feet and also has a skylight.

        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nHouses in New England are a special breed. Plenty of them are more than 100 years old, while others make the most of narrow floor plans on tiny lots. Historic districts, zoning restrictions, and other guardrails can add layers of red tape while renovating or expanding these homes.\n\nTo work around some of these rules, builders and architects have had to get creative \u2014 whether that\u2019s carving out additional storage space from some unused corner or transforming an oddly shaped nook into something more useful. Ahead, find three unique home projects that maximize each home\u2019s nooks and crannies.\n\n\nWhen Rajiv Raman set out to convert the garage of his 1870s Somerville home into another bedroom, he knew he might encounter a few challenges. For one, working within the home\u2019s small footprint would be complex, and removing and adding walls was likely to affect other parts of the house.\n\nThat was the case in Raman\u2019s small kitchen, which needed to be expanded to connect the garage to the main house. The problem? The only wall offering natural light into the space needed to go. \u201cWe knew that we would have to get rid of the bay window in our kitchen, but we didn\u2019t want to just wall it off,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe wanted to create some other source of light in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nSo he brainstormed with his architect, Patrick Rettig, to find a unique solution: Building a \u201cskylight nook\u201d as an additional lounge area for his two kids, with rows of windows to let sunlight into the kitchen. Now, this 5\u00bd-foot-tall bump-out is a place for the kids to play games, kick back with their Nintendo Switch or iPad, and do homework.\n\nSince the three windows on the wall looked directly out to their neighbor\u2019s roof deck, Raman attached window clings to create a frosted effect for privacy. For added customization, he ordered carpet fragments to cover the back of the built-in bench below the nook.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also this company on Amazon where you can just send them exact dimensions of very odd-shaped benches, and they\u2019ll custom make a cushion,\u201d he said, so he plopped the custom cushions on the bench to complete the new dining area created by the nook. The built-in bench and accompanying table freed up precious square footage in the kitchen, too.\n\n\u201cNow we have a kitchen you can actually walk around in,\u201d Raman said. \u201cIt really opened up the space by Somerville standards.\u201d\n\n\nRenovation projects located in historic districts naturally come with constraints. For his clients who lived in a half-Cape in Provincetown, Chris Brown, principal and founder ofb Architecture studio, knew the challenge was optimizing the home\u2019s original footprint without expanding it.\n\n\nThe first floor, in particular, was in desperate need of creative storage solutions. To find a place for everyday essentials, Brown modified the home\u2019s central staircase, building full-depth drawers below them for shoes and other mudroom accessories. Two triangular and two rectangular drawers are now equipped with heavy-duty drawer glides, allowing them to hold considerable weight.\n\n\nJust around the corner, the team also built an appliance storage cubby on the remaining underside of the staircase. Each cubby was custom-sized and built to fit both the coffee maker and microwave, effectively preventing them from cluttering the countertops.\n\n\u201cAnd then we still had a little bit of leftover space, and the clients asked \u2018What about a small wine fridge?\u2019\u201d Brown said. He devised a way to squeeze an eight- to 12-bottle wine fridge in the remaining nook. Now, Brown reasoned, the clients can enjoy an ideal use of that space.\n\n\u201cMaybe half of our projects, sometimes more, are dealing with at least some existing conditions, and certainly zoning and square footage constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love doing these types of creative, fun built-ins that let us think a little differently about what that space could be.\u201d\n\n\nWhile expanding their primary bathroom, the owners of a duplex in Charlestown were presented with a small conundrum: They needed to encroach into the floor plan of the adjoining guest bedroom \u2014 unevenly.\n\n\n\u201cIt became an odd footprint,\u201d explained Dennis Duffy, principal ofDuffy Design Group, since the expanded bathroom left an angular \u201chole\u201d in the bottom section of the wall.\n\nAt the same time, Duffy said the clients were keen to have a place where their guests could relax on their own, either to watch TV or read. The solution then materialized: The extra space could be converted into a \u201cpit\u201d for reading and relaxing, as well as additional sleeping space for visiting children. (Later, a TV was installed in the nook.)\n\n\u201c[The clients] loved the solution of the modular \u2018pit,\u2019\u201d Duffy said. They enthusiastically agreed to a graphic treatment off the interior wall, featuring strips of wood and offset disk light fixtures.\n\nAs for what to relax upon, the team selected a layout with cushions inspired byRoche Bobois\u2019s iconicMah Jong collection, a modular sofa that can be converted into countless different shapes.\n\nThe result is a cozy relaxation pit balancing equal parts comfort and style.\n\n\u201cHaving begun my career in New York City, I\u2019m used to working with small spaces,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI learned early on to try to find the best functional solutions for spaces like this, as long as it stays on message with the concept and adds functionality.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nAnyone who has ever taken a field trip to Salem will recognize the name tied to 252 Essex Street in Beverly, which is currently on the market for $600,000.\nGiles Corey, a farmer accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials, pleaded \u201cnot guilty.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d achieve a fair trial and refused to speak. He was subsequently sentenced to death by pressing\u00a0and became one of the most notable figures from the witch trials with the phrase he repeated as he died: \u201cMore weight.\u201d According to legend, that\u2019s what Corey repeatedly said to his executioners as they added more stones on top of him. (He was also written as a character in Arthur Miller\u2019sThe Crucible.)\nThe four-bed, two-bath property, which was first built in 1675 and underwent a variety of transformations over the years,\u00a0belonged to William Cleaves, who was Corey\u2019s son-in-law.\nSet on .79 of an acre, the 2,315-square-foot home looks almost plucked out of Corey\u2019s era thanks to everything from the wide-plank pine floors to the well in the basement (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s on city water now).\nA few steps up, on the right side of the home, under a small porch, brings you into an 184-square-foot kitchen, the first space built in the home. It features green tile floors, an operational 1930s stove, and a walk-in pantry. There\u2019s also a door to an additional staircase to the second story. Next door is the second dining room, a 222-square-foot space featuring wood floors and a ceiling with beams that resemble logs. The remnants of a chimney stack sit in the corner. A 267-square-foot living room has wide plank floors and a fireplace that should be inspected before use. Two windows overlook the stunning gardens and street. A green door to the right of the fireplace leads to the downstairs bathroom, which features a shower. A door to the left of the fireplace moves into the foyer, home to the main entrance of the home.\nContinue through to the second dining room, a charming 241-square-foot space with a built-in hutch, beamed ceiling, and easy access to the back patio through a door. The main kitchen, a 169-square-foot space, is next door and has a washer/dryer that\u2019s included in the sale, track lighting overhead, and a door to the other front porch. A French door leads into a pantry, while a thinner French door leads to a mini pantry. Another door leads to the back patio.\nHead back into the foyer to access the main staircase to the second story, where you\u2019ll find each of the four bedrooms. The top of the staircase is also home to the second full bathroom, which has a tub. A bonus room measuring 239 square feet is a great addition to the second story, and a walk-up attic provides extra storage space.\nThe home features a fieldstone and dirt basement. There is also a separate 1-car garage that measures 344 square feet, as well as a storage space that measures 121 square feet.\nThe home\u2019s outdoor spaces are some of its greatest features. The backyard, which is partially protected by conservation restrictions, is filled with trees, giant rocks, and a treehouse. The front yard is home to beautiful gardens, where wisteria hangs, and garden plots outlined by stone are frequently noticed by passersby.\n\u201cThe gardens are something that almost everybody knows,\u201d saysDiantha Phosithanof Engel & V\u00f6lkers By the Sea, who has thelisting.\nThe home will need a new roof \u201cpretty much right away.\u201d\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "A year after a landmark settlement called for a disruption in how real estate agents are paid, people say they still feel forced to pay them excessive commissions.",
        "content": "By Debra Kamin, New York Times Service\n\nWhen Mike Chambers was ready to sell his house in Boulder, Colorado, last month, he interviewed a handful of real estate agents who promised he could fetch $2.75 million or more if he listed with them.\n\nBut the promise would come at a cost: Each agent wanted him to pay a commission of at least 5%, or $137,500.\n\nFrustrated that not a single agent was willing to budge on the rate, Chambers, 39, decided to sell his house on his own, and he took to social media with the handle @realtorshateme to chronicle the process. His reels drew 50,000 views or more.\n\nWithin days, local agents were making their own social media posts that countered his points \u2014 an action Chambers described as an aggressive campaign aimed at preventing him from making a sale on his own.\n\nCall it the Realtor recoil.\n\nOne year after theNational Association of Realtors agreed, as part of a legal settlement, to change a key rule on real estate commissions \u2014 a rule that had long uphelda tradition of commissionsbetween 5% and 6%, little has changed.\n\nWhat was hailed as a watershed has so far produced a mere drizzle.\n\nSome economists predicted the rule change would upend the business model and bring competition to a long-stilted marketplace, breaking the standard 6% rate \u2014 one of the highest rates in the world \u2014 and forcing down home prices as a result.\n\nThough average commissions appear to be slipping, industry watchdogs say that Realtors and their brokerages have used workarounds and pressure on sellers like Chambers to subvert the settlement. So far, they\u2019re finding success.\n\n\u201cThe industry understood the threat to 5 or 6% rates right away, so looked for opportunities to discourage negotiation,\u201d said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Policy Center, who has been vocal about the need for greater consumer awareness in the real estate industry.\n\nReal estate commissions in the United States have long been baked into a home\u2019s listing price and then paid by the seller to their agent. The agent would then split that payout with the agent who brought a buyer, usually with 2.5% to 3% for each.\n\nThe rate of the commission split was communicated on private listing databases available only to agents, called multiple listing services, and in the lawsuit that led to the settlement,a group of home sellers in Missouriargued that the covert sharing of rates led to a lack of transparency about whom, and how much, home sellers were required to pay. They also argued it inflated fees.\n\nA jury agreed, and NAR and the brokerages were ordered to pay nearly $2 billion in damages. The settlement came five months later, with the NAR agreement to end the practice of commission-sharing over MLS databases as part of the deal. NAR also agreed to pay$418 million to settle the claims, and some brokerages separately settled for millions of dollars.\n\nAfter a six-month reprieve, the NAR rule changebecame official in August 2024. Average commissions dropped from 5.64% to 4.96% in the months that followed, which means a drop in commission of $2,870 on a median-priced home, according to a survey of 1,300 agents conducted by RISMedia, a real estate media company. (Two other studies, conducted by the online brokerage Redfin and the cloud-based real estate accounting firm AccountTech, found commissions have not changed, but those results could be considered biased because both organizations have a stake in the results.)\n\n\u201cThe system has been in place for 100 years. It\u2019s not going to change overnight,\u201d said Michael Ketchmark, the lawyer who represented the Missouri homeowners. \u201cIt\u2019s not like one day we started streaming movies and then Blockbuster video stores were suddenly gone. It was a slow progressive change in technology and that\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing here.\u201d\n\nMany agents say that since the settlement, they\u2019ve felt cornered by buyers and sellers alike to defend their value. Jeremy Larsen, a Realtor in Dallas, said that consumers who decide to navigate the home market without an agent are taking huge risks with their money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like walking into a courtroom without an attorney. Why would you do that? There\u2019s so many possible things that can go wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nOne viral Instagram video, created last month by a Realtor in Fresno, California, with 114,000 followers, shows a man driving down a suburban cul-de-sac and encountering a seller\u2019s agent standing outside a house for sale with a sign that reads \u201c0 percent\u201d \u2014 referring to the amount of commissions the sellers were willing to pay any agent who brought a buyer.\n\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nAt the house next door, also for sale, an agent holds a sign that reads \u201c3 percent.\u201d The man pulls over and says he\u2019d like to take a look.\n\nThe video may have been a joke, but its message was clear: Many agents, now banned from making offers of commission to each other on private Realtor-only databases, are not adapting to the intent of the settlement. Rather than encouraging buyers to now negotiate rates on their own, they continue to press sellers to offer commissions of 5% 6%, and then discuss commission splits among themselves.\n\nThose commission splits are largely happening the old-fashioned way: phone, email and text. In one TikTok video viewed by The New York Times, a real estate coach in Virginia with 60,000 followers, trains her viewers on how to build a landing page for each of her listings that sends automated messages to buyers\u2019 agents informing them of the commission they will receive if they bring a buyer.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n\u201cIt only took a matter of weeks really, for most agents to find a loophole. It\u2019s almost a joke,\u201d said Nick Aufenkamp, a Realtor in Washington who started a coaching business, DIY Homebuyer Academy, after the settlement to help buyers learn how to represent themselves in real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to see any change in this industry,\u201d Aufenkamp said. He estimates he has coached 30 clients who wanted to represent themselves in a home purchase and ran into a wall.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe National Association of Realtors \u201cis resolutely opposed to any attempt to circumvent the settlement,\u201d said a spokesperson, Troy Green, who added that any attempts from agents to influence buyers\u2019 or sellers\u2019 decisions in order to gain more commission \u201cis unequivocally not something that NAR condones.\u201d The organization has a fact sheet on its website explaining that steering is a violation of their code of ethics.\n\nBut Green added that the settlement \u201cexpressly allows\u201d agents to communicate offers of commission between each other on venues outside of the MLS databases.\n\nAnd there lies the rub, said Doug Miller, a Minnesota lawyer who five years ago brought one of the first lawsuits over inflated commissions to Cohen Milstein, a Chicago law firm.\n\n\u201cThe NAR settlement solves MLS steering. It did not solve steering,\u201d he said. \u201cSharing is caring. Unless you\u2019re a Realtor, and then it\u2019s collusion.\u201d\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nSome agents have turned to the legislative process to protect commission sharing. A few months after NAR lost its lawsuit, Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Rosino, a former broker, co-sponsored a bill requiring agents on both sides of a transaction to share their fees in writing. With the support of Oklahoma\u2019s influential Realtor association, that bill passed, and went into effect, in May.\n\nThe New York Times interviewed 15 buyers and sellers across the country, from Colorado to Ohio to Arizona and beyond, who said they were blocked out of the market when they tried to negotiate commissions, or navigate transactions without a real estate agent.\n\nIn Boulder, Chambers\u2019 home listing caught the eye of a local real estate agent, Lindsay Alfano. Alfano, 25, has been an agent for two years. She said Chambers had promised to pay a buyer\u2019s agent commission, and she told fellow agents at her brokerage, eXp, that she was planning to show the house to her buyers.\n\nShe received text messages mocking her and encouraging her to change course. The Times reviewed the messages.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working for free,\u201d one colleague said.\n\n\u201cSell your own listings,\u201d another wrote. \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nAlfano described her peers\u2019 reaction as eye-opening. \u201cThe amount of people that were so scared of this guy having access to what we do was a rude awakening for me,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe word is steering. If you\u2019re worried how much you\u2019re going to get paid based on the home that your client loves, you\u2019re doing it for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nChambers found a buyer in early March and his home is now under contract. He is now focused, he said, on building a new company that he says \u201cwill disrupt the real estate industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to pay someone for their services, of course, but I don\u2019t want to just light money on fire because there\u2019s a system that\u2019s forcing me to,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nQ.Our next door neighbors recently installed a Mitsubishi heat pump system. We love the idea of heat pumps and have strongly considered installing one ourselves. However, our sleep at night and peace during the day have been destroyed ever since they started using their heat pump. Our house is getting hit with heavy, low frequency sound/vibrations. It sounds like a train or giant truck idling beside one\u2019s ear and sometimes the sound waves seem to harmonize to such a point that a long, almost groaning, vibratory pulse is heard and felt. The owners themselves do not seem to be effected, but the three fan/compressor units all face our house directly and everything is built on rock here. We suspect that the sound and vibrations are being transferred through the rock and resonating with our own home construction materials. Certain weather and atmospheric conditions seem to amplify and significantly worsen the sound. Have you heard of or experienced this issue and, if so, do you have any suggestions?\n\n\u2014\u00a0MICHELLE\n\nA.This is a tough one. There are a lot of opinions out there given that conditions vary from installation to installation. We have not encountered this problem yet. A few suggestions:\n\nSince many low-frequency noises are associated with vibrations, the easiest first pass would be to ask your neighbors to place vibration-dampening pads under the unit. That could help somewhat.\n\nOur HVAC company said that it is possible to have the fan blades changed to a more aerodynamic model/material. This is the most likely culprit, but is likely to be a costly fix.\n\nAnother option is to have a roof built over the units. We have done that before in certain instances, given that these heat pumps need to be kept clear of snow in the winter to operate properly. Your neighbors could insulate the roof frame with sound-deadening insulation like rock wool. If so, this could mitigate some of the low-frequency noise.\n\nQ.We have a wood stove inserted into our fireplace. We were told to have our chimney cleaned every four cords of wood. That is very different from your advice (How often should you have your chimney swept?, Jan. 19). Also my husband was diagnosed with a pulmonary disorder, so we are being more conscious of particulates in the air that would irritate his lungs. What are your thoughts on both of these?\n\n\u2014 SARAH\n\nA.I would not advise waiting until you burn four full cords of wood to clean your chimney. Especially if there is some soft woods like pine or spruce mixed in with your hardwoods. Soft woods leave far more creosote buildup than hardwoods like oak and maple. One of the reasons we suggest yearly cleaning for people who burn wood regularly is because it gets a professional\u2019s eye on your whole chimney. They clean it, inspect for animal infiltration, check the masonry, etc. It\u2019s like having a quality mechanic regularly looking under the hood of your car.\n\nGiven that a family member has pulmonary concerns, I think you should be extra vigilant. The smoke from wood-burning fires is particularly hazardous if not contained. It may seem natural and nontoxic, but the particulates emitted can get deep into the lungs.\n\nSomething to consider is an exhaust fan at the top of the chimney that mechanically draws the smoke up through the flue. We have used them when we were worried about how well a chimney would draft. Another less expensive option would be to have an air cleaner in the room taking care of any smoke that may escape from the smoke chamber.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nWant to park in the heart of Beacon Hill? It\u2019ll cost you \u2014 $750,000, to be exact.\nA coveted spot in the Brimmer Street Garage is now up for sale, offering a rare chance to own a piece of prime city real estate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pure luxury purchase,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, the senior vice president of Cabot and Company, the listing agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. It\u2019s not like everyone can go shopping at Hermes or take private jet travel.\u201d\n\u201cBut I get it though, because it is outrageous to a certain extent,\u201d Rodriguez continued. \u201cBut, if you have the money to do it, it\u2019s very convenient.\u201d\nLast year, thegarage had three to four transfers, with the highest-priced spot selling for around $565,000. However, several transfers were for only $1 because they were tacked onto a house sale, making it difficult to determine their market value.\nOften, owners sell the spaces privately, so when they do go to market, \u201cthey always create a splash,\u201d said Rodriguez.\nRodriguez said that private transactions sometimes leave money on the table. In this case, the sellers of the parking spot decided to see what they could get on the market.\nMany of the homes on Beacon Hill lack parking spaces, leaving residents with few options for covered, off-street parking, creating a competitive market.\nThe price of parking at the Brimmer Street garage has consistently increased year over year. Rodriguez said the spots first came on the market in the 1970s, and they were going for $7,500 per spot.\n\u201cBut a lot has changed since then,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nHousing prices have also dramatically increased, with many places going for millions \u2014 often without parking.\nRodriguez noted that at those costs, what\u2019s another $750,000 for the convenience of having a parking spot? Plus, it would increase the home\u2019s resale value.\nThe buyer does get some perks. In addition to being a place to park a car, the parking is all valet, it has a filling and charging station, and attended staff can wash the car.\nBut there are ongoing costs beyond buying the deeded spot itself. HOA fees apply, and because the spots are categorized as individual condominiums, they incur additional taxes. Altogether, Rodriguez said it\u2019s about $900 a month.\nBut if you\u2019re not lucky enough to snag a spot at the Brimmer Street Garage, there are the LAZ Charles Street Garage and the Boston Common garages nearby. But both are public, with no valet, and you\u2019ve got to compete with other drivers for limited spaces.\nOr, one can look for street parking.\nEither way, \u201cthe Brimmer Street garage is in a better location,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more exclusive, private parking situation.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

The city and the soccer team dispute those claims, and so far two judges have ruled in their favor, including one that has allowed demolition to proceed ahead of the start of the trial on Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. That case could determine the fate of the $200 million White Stadium project.Related: On eve of White Stadium legal battle, judge\u2019s ruling deals significant blow to plaintiffs\u2019 hopes of stopping projectAdvertisementThe conservancy\u2019s legal campaign has confounded many in Boston\u2019s civic and nonprofit worlds. Since its founding nearly three decades ago, the group has worked closely with City Hall to maintain parkland, a partnership that allows the nonprofit to use the city-owned James Michael Curley mansion on the Jamaicaway as its headquarters for $1 a year. Now they\u2019re at war.\u201cI just feel the conservancy has lost its way,\u201d said Julie Crockford, who served as its president from 2007 to 2015 and notes the organization \u201ccan\u2019t mow a blade of grass\u201d without the city\u2019s permission. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the attitude over the fight. ... I think the voice of cooperation and behind-the-scenes negotiation would have been a stronger hand.\u201dDemolition is underway in preparation for a $200 million redevelopment of White Stadium in Franklin Park.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeThat\u2019s typically how nonprofit parks organizations operate. They don\u2019t always see eye to eye with City Hall and may even find themselves on the opposite sides of an issue, but to sue represents an \u201cextreme choice\u201d that risks irreparable damage to the relationship, said Liz Vizza, who recently retired as the longtime president of the Friends of the Public Garden.AdvertisementIn 2016, Vizza was locked in a similarly fierce battle with the city and then-Mayor Marty Walsh over a plan to change state law to allow a proposed skyscraper at the city-owned Winthrop Square Garage, which would cast shadows across Boston Common and the Public Garden.Related: White Stadium project opponents pitch a scaled-down, cheaper alternativeIn that instance, Friends of the Public Garden did not choose to sue but rather duked it out in the court of public opinion. And even though Walsh got his way \u2014 today the 691-foot Winthrop Center by Millennium Partners soars over the Financial District \u2014 Vizza still believes it was the right decision. (Walsh set aside millions of dollars from the sale of the Winthrop garage to invest in the Common and Franklin Park.)\u201cWe knew that if we sued the city ... it would take a generation or more to reestablish a relationship that is vital to working on behalf of these parks,\u201d Vizza said. \u201cSuing would be an extreme choice that we didn\u2019t make because it would have wrecked the relationship.\u201dLeaders of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, which has never before sued the city, say they did not make this decision lightly, but they felt it was necessary.\u201cWe see this as part of our mission in a way to protect the park,\u201d said Ben Taylor, the conservancy\u2019s longtime chairman and a former publisher of The Boston Globe whose family owned the newspaper for more than a century. \u201cBuilding a professional soccer stadium in Franklin Park is not protecting the park.\u201dRelated: White Stadium project cost has doubled from previous estimates, with city on hook for $91 millionThe conservancy was founded in 1998, conceived to help prevent the kind of flooding of the Muddy River that devastated Kenmore Square in the late 1990s. Since then, it has grown in both staff and scope, helping care for more than 7,000 trees, picking up trash in the parks, sponsoring concerts and artwork, and advocating for parks funding at both the city and state levels. AdvertisementWhile Franklin Park Coalition, a different nonprofit that advocates for Franklin Park and works closely with the conservancy, negotiated with the city for months over concessions for White Stadium, the conservancy seemed intent on throwing up roadblocks, said coalition president Rickie Thompson.The city-owned James Michael Curley House in Jamaica Plain is the headquarters of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeHis coalition had concerns over game-day parking and stadium maintenance but hashed things out with the city and ultimately decided to support the project by the time the city signed a lease with the soccer team in December. (Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has been part of the investor group behind the soccer team but announced last month she is withdrawing from it).With the team aiming to play in 2026, Thompson saw the conservancy\u2019s litigation strategy as a delay tactic tantamount to \u201ckilling the project\u201d and says Boston student-athletes will be the losers.\u201cIt would be fine to slow it down if you had all the time in the world,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI ran track in high school in White Stadium over 50 years ago, and that stadium has been deteriorating ever since. So we\u2019ve been waiting for 50 years. How much do you want to slow it down? 100 years?\u201dThe first whiff of legal trouble came in January 2024, when the conservancy sent a five-page comment letter to the Boston Landmarks Commission as part of the project review process. The letter, as one City Hall aide put it, \u201cwas written by a lawyer.\u201dAdvertisementCity officials immediately convened a series of meetings with Taylor and conservancy president Karen Mauney-Brodek. There was even a sit down with Wu in her fifth-floor office. The city only learned it was being sued when Globe columnist Adrian Walker called for comment a few weeks later, in February 2024.\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Wu said.Rickie Thompson, president of the Franklin Park Coalition, photographed in 2022.Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffBut looking back, the mayor remembers that meeting in her office with conservancy leaders, and feeling like, even at that early stage, the group didn\u2019t want to engage about solutions to their stated concerns.\u201cIt just felt like they were meeting to check a box,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were trying to work through all of the different concerns that they might have, and I was really in listening mode at that point. The project was very much a concept.\u201dWu said she has found the conservancy\u2019s stance \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d and that \u201cwe have not and still are not all at the table together.\u201dOne of the driving forces behind the lawsuit is Mauney-Brodek, who has been president of the conservancy since 2016 after working in the parks departments in San Francisco and New York City.Related: BOS Nation doesn\u2019t want to feel like \u2018the baby sister.\u2019 That\u2019s why the team won\u2019t play with the men in Everett. | Shirley LeungWe met up Friday, walking the perimeter of White Stadium as bulldozers whirred and beeped while prepping the grounds for construction. She showed me the young oak trees the conservancy planted nearby and defended the group\u2019s legal action.\u201cThis is not something just to sit back and watch,\u201d Mauney-Brodek said. \u201cWe repeatedly spoke with the Parks Department, wrote letters, met with them, reached out, attempted to find other resolutions. The city had no other ways to go forward.\u201dAdvertisementAnd if anyone feels blindsided, she said, it is the conservancy. When the city, conservancy, and other stakeholders worked on a Franklin Park Action Plan in 2022, the idea of a professional soccer stadium never came up.So far the law has been on the city\u2019s side. Still, Mauney-Brodek is hoping to prevail at the trial.\u201cThis is about the park, and this is about these protections that matter for the city of Boston, for this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and all of the parks they\u2019re in,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is public land, and that\u2019s the fundamental question here.\u201dOn Tuesday, a judge will begin the process of determining who is right and who is wrong. The lawsuit should be resolved in a week or two. But the divide this case has opened between the city and a parks group could last a lot longer than that.Demolition is underway at White Stadium even as a trial begins Tuesday on a lawsuit challenging the project.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeShirley Leung is a Business columnist.

His father funded High Point State Park and helped birth Fox Film, while his grandfather launched Prudential Insurance and served as a US senator.\nKuser, a Princeton grad, made his own mark pushing the eastern goldfinch as New Jersey\u2019s state bird in 1935 \u2014 a win that had senators mocking with fake chirps, per The Ridgewood News.\nAshley Christus of Turpin Real Estate holds the listing.\n\u201cDenbrooke is a timeless gem,\u201d Christus said. \u201cOver the years, it has been the cherished backdrop for family weddings, graduation parties and intimate gatherings alike.\u201d\nSet on 6.6 acres, the home, in Somerset Hills, has been professionally landscaped to include a deer fence, mature specimen trees, expansive level lawns, a perennial garden and an oval swimming pool, the listing notes. Three finished levels house the bedrooms, seven full baths and three powder rooms.\nBut behind the mansion\u2019s grand doors, Astor\u2019s life was crumbling.\nMarried at 17, she later revealed in her memoir \u201cFootprints\u201d about a marriage riddled with booze, alleged affairs and abuse that left her crying herself to sleep.\nAstor toughed it out long enough to oversee a glam overhaul by A-list architect Albert Musgrave Hyde, but by 1930, she was done \u2014 grabbing their son Anthony and filing for divorce in a split that exploded across headlines nationwide.\nKuser\u2019s political career tanked after losing a reelection bid in 1935, and he faded into obscurity, dying in 1964.\nAstor, however, bounced back, marrying Vincent Astor, inheriting a fortune, and becoming a philanthropy juggernaut, earning a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998 before passing away at 105 in 2007.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "As the saying goes, a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money \u2014 and real estate.\nMore than 13% of the country\u2019s real estate assets are owned by the wealthiest 1% of Americans \u2014\u00a0a circumstance that significantly enriched the well-heeled over the past two years of sky-high rates and housing shortages. The 1% has been so enriched, a recent Redfin analysis revealed, that their combined wealth could now feasibly purchase almost every home in the nation.\nThe analysis further concluded that the top 0.1% alone could purchase every single home in the country\u2019s 25 most populated metro areas, from New York City to San Antonio.\n\u201cIt is a striking example of the concentration of wealth in America that the top 1% could hypothetically afford to buy every home in the country \u2014 without going into debt \u2014 while millions of households struggle to buy or hold onto just one,\u201d said Chen Zhao, Redfin\u2019s economics research lead, in the report.\nThis stark disparity comes at a time when an outsized percentage of Americans believe that homeownership is no longer a realistic milestone.\nTo gain entry into the 1% club, according to the Federal Reserve, a minimum net worth of $11.2 million is required. An estimated 1.3 million American households claim membership, and their combined net worth totals $49.2 trillion. Real estate helps put this gargantuan number into perspective \u2014 the combined value of 100 million US homes is $49.7 trillion.\nIt\u2019s these two eye-popping measures upon which Redfin based its report, using Federal Reserve data and the estimated value of 98 million US properties. While net worth and aggregate home values are not directly related, the Redfin analysis demonstrated how the two measures have pretty much tracked together for the last 20 years.\nAccording to Redfin, aggregate home values exceeded the 1%\u2019s collective wealth from 2000 until the housing and global financial crisis of 2008. The wealth of the top 1% surpassed home values through the 2010s until a steep drop-off after 2020, when the market disruption of COVID-19 hit the heavily invested portfolios of the rich.\nBut America\u2019s fat cats have clawed their way back. The richest 0.1% of Americans grew their wealth by $4.4 trillion, or 25%, in just two years, Redfin reported.\nIf the 0.1% pooled only that $4.4 trillion earned between 2022 and 2024, they could buy every home in the Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Houston metro areas, according to Redfin. Their two-year gains exceed the combined wealth of America\u2019s bottom 50%.\nAsset growth has long outpaced wage growth, which makes real estate one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Almost half of the bottom 50% of Americans\u2019 net worth is tied up in real estate. And while the assets of the 1% dwarf those of the bottom 50%, the latter group claims the highest total mortgage debt at $3.1 trillion, Redfin reported.\nThe analysis adds credence to the frustration of everyday Americans, already discouraged by a real estate market in which the median listing price haslong surpassed $400,000. The median age for first-time buyers is 38 \u2014the oldest on record.\nAdvertisement",

(Of course, there are commercial offerings \u2014 such as condominium buildings \u2014 and other investment sales now listed in the portal that are larger in size.)\nThe discount buzz comes hot on the heels of another posh property,973 Fifth Ave., finally snagging a buyer last month after four years for sale.\nAdam Modlin of the Modlin Group, the broker who nabbed the buyer for that pending sale, now reps the Woolworth pad. He\u2019s crowing that it\u2019s the \u201cbest value\u201d for a place this massive, clocking in at about $2,500 a square foot.\nLucille Roberts, the force behind a women-only gym empire, and her real estate hotshot hubby Bob bought the place for $6 million in 1995 from the Young Men\u2019s Philanthropic League.\nThey poured years into sprucing it up before Lucille passed away in 2003.\nTheir family tried selling it in 2011 for that sky-high $90 million \u2014 hoping to smash townhouse sale records \u2014 but no dice.\nTwo years later, they yanked it off the market after a disgruntled ex-employee of Lucille\u2019s gyms allegedly went rogue, splattering white paint and firing BB pellets at the facade in 2012.\nKevin Roberts, the couple\u2019s son, previously told the Wall Street Journal he bunked there with his dad until 2016. Bob eventually left Manhattan for the Hamptons and Palm Beach, leaving the property to rake in $80,000 a month from a deep-pocketed renter in 2021.\nThe offering, designed by architect C.P.H. Gilbert in 1915 for retail titan Frank Woolworth\u2019s daughter Helena has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, three kitchens \u2014 plus a gym, a library, a sauna and a solarium. Other touches include mosaic tiles, stained glass and a dining room that could host a small army.\nWoolworth, the \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d king, originally built it as part of a family compound \u2014 two other homes for his kids once stood nearby until their deaths in\u00a01920s.

The buyer remains anonymous, hidden behind a shell company \u2014 for now.\nRobert A.M. Stern famously designed the limestone building. But his firm also designed the penthouse, a source said. And the new buyer is hoping that the same team can \u201crefresh\u201d the penthouse to keep it exactly the same, the source added.\nThe sale comes as Kogan is butting heads with Putin over ownership of the Domodedovo airport.\nIn January, Russian news outlet\u00a0Vedomosti\u00a0reported that Russian prosecutorsfiled a caseagainst Kogan and Dmitry Kamenshchik, claiming they failed to renationalize the holding company that manages the facility.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Russian government tried to take back control of the airport, which was privatized in 1997. In Russia, it\u2019s illegal for foreign entities to control assets deemed to be strategic to national security.\nWhen it first hit the market for $65 million in 2023, the 15 Central Park West listing included a one-bedroom and a studio in the building. They are now slated to sell separately for less than $5 million, sources said.\nFor its part, the 40th-floor penthouse is a sprawling 5,398 square feet. It comes with four bedrooms, an elaborate home office that doubles as a screening room and 3\u00bd bathrooms.\u00a0Extravagant details include a giant malachite stone fireplace and large onyx tables, as well as a stained-glass door. There\u2019s also plenty of carved wood, custom floors and high-end finishes \u2014 not to mention a chef\u2019s kitchen and dazzling city views.\nKogan also recently sold his 7-acre Greenwich, Conn., estate for $10.4 million,as Gimme Shelter previously reported.\nHowever, his palatial pad at the Plaza Hotel \u2014 that comes with a castle-like turret \u2014 is still on the market. Since February, the\u00a0condo has been asking $23 million \u2014 down from the original $50 million ask, as Gimme also noted.\nAn additional one-bedroom apartment in the Plaza across the hall, No. 1008, is asking under $3 million. The listing broker for both apartments is Compass\u2019s Charlie Attias.\nThe Kogans also sold a penthouse in Israel for $33 million and a condo at 515 Park Ave. for $14.5 million, which had first listed for $25 million.\u00a0In addition, they have another home in Israel that first listed for $259 million and is now asking a dramatically less $89 million, according to reports.\nThe listing broker for the 15 Central Park West penthouse, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Adam Rothman, declined to comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Thousands of drivers whiz by the vacant brick building perched precariously over the Mystic River every day without giving it a second thought. But city officials in Everett and Boston have been giving this former sewage pumphouse a lot of thought lately, as they eye it for potential restoration and redevelopment amid the broader rebirth underway around the Encore Boston Harbor casino across the street.Although it\u2019s on the Everett side of the river, the 15,000-square-foot pumphouse actually sits within a tiny sliver of Boston that extends along Alford Street (Route 99). Consultants are about to finish studying the feasibility of redoing the 19th-century building, as soon as this month, on behalf of the cities of Everett and Boston, and funded by state gaming commission funds.Ideas have ranged from turning it into a community center, to a kayak and canoe launch, to a beer hall. The leading concept, though, seems to be a ferry terminal, in part because the Kraft Group is eyeing the site next door to build a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution.\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about it,\u201d said Patrick Herron, executive director of the Mystic River Watershed Association. \u201cWhat a way to breathe life into a historic building on the edge of the water.\u201dAdvertisementKathy Abbott, chief executive of the nonprofit Boston Harbor Now, said the site is an ideal location for a ferry terminal because it\u2019s on the Boston Harbor side of the Alford Street bridge, whose low height prevents many commercial boats from passing under it. (Casino owner Wynn Resorts commissioned ferries purpose-built to fit under the bridge to serve casino customers.)While a boat landing could help with game-day transit for pro soccer games, Abbott said any terminal\u2019s full potential would depend on whether other public transportation projects proposed for the area come to fruition, such as a Silver Line bus-rapid-transit extension or a new commuter rail stop next to the casino.The conversations around the pumphouse, currently owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, started a few years ago, long before state lawmakers approved legislation in November that rezones the adjacent site for a soccer stadium. That legislation removes the site next door, home to a shuttered power plant, from what\u2019s known as a Designated Port Area, where only marine industrial uses can be developed.AdvertisementHowever, per state officials, the legislation left the pumphouse property in the DPA. That could pose a challenge to any redevelopment of the site, although a ferry terminal would be an allowed use within the zone. Other challenges include the limited space for parking and a dilapidated seawall that needs to be shored up.Herron said he expects state regulators would be willing to remove the site from the DPA because it\u2019s not currently home to industrial use. (The MWRA stopped pumping at the facility in 1993, replacing it with a more modern facility across the street, though an active sewer pipe passes under one portion of the 1890s building.)Everett and Boston officials are also engaged in discussions about a harborwalk extension that would bring the path along the Mystic River from the casino across the street, under the Alford Street bridge, and around the pumphouse to the stadium site.Tom Philbin, an environmental planner with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria\u2019s administration, said Massachusetts Gaming Commission grants have so far provided nearly $250,000 to design the 1,500-foot harborwalk extension and around $200,000 to study the feasibility of restoring the pumphouse. (The money comes out of community mitigation funds overseen by the gaming commission for casino host cities and nearby communities.)In a preliminary community agreement signed with DeMaria in late 2023, the Kraft Group agreed to pay for completing the harborwalk extension from the casino to the soccer stadium site. However, the Revs and Patriots ownership is not currently involved in the talks around the pumphouse\u2019s future.AdvertisementStacy Thompson, interim executive director at Historic Boston, the primary consultant studying the pumphouse\u2019s viability, said the restoration hinges on the eventual price tag. But she remains hopeful that the pumphouse could become an important piece in the broader mosaic of this new urban neighborhood gradually taking shape. At this time, any final decision on the building\u2019s fate would ultimately be up to the MWRA.\u201cThere\u2019s so much potential,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cCould it be a ferry station or a landing point? Yes. Could it be something else that serves the community? Yes. We\u2019re not there yet [but] we\u2019re getting closer to understanding what\u2019s possible.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

        "content": "This California listing sure \u201cangled\u201d its way into an all-out bidding war.\nA midcentury-modern home in the Berkeley Hills outside of San Francisco \u2014 and one designed by the locally prominent architect John Hans Ostwald \u2014 has sold for $1.6 million, marking a breathtaking increase that was more than double the listing\u2019s asking price.\nWhat\u2019s more, the striking hexagonal residence, which asked $795,000 for sale, only spent two weeks on the market, The Post has learned.\nListed on Feb. 6, the property went into contract 14 days later, fetching 101% over the list price in a frenzy of buyer interest that saw more than 30 offers, 70 private showings, 300 inquiries and more than 1,000 visitors swarm its open houses.\nNeedless to say, the home\u2019s explosive demand caught listing agent, Jodi Nishimura of Kai Real Estate, off guard.\n\u201cWe knew that the [midcentury-modern] vibe and hexagon shape of the home would be interesting, but did not expect as many people to be drawn to the home,\u201d she told The Post.\nThe listing kicked off with a brokers\u2019 tour on Feb. 5, followed by a late-day open house where \u201cpeople were in awe at the incredible sunset during the twilight hours.\u201d\nBy the weekend, the Saturday open house burned through 100 brochures in just two and a half hours, while Sunday saw an unrelenting stream of visitors.\n\u201cOne of our open houses counted over 300 people,\u201d Nishimura said.\nPriced as a \u201cteaser\u201d in a competitive East Bay market, the home\u2019s allure among many prospective buyers stemmed from a perfect storm of factors, with Nishimura citing the ask, its design, its location and market conditions.\nThis architectural treasure, named the Foley House, was commissioned in 1963 by a dental hygienist who remained its sole owner until her recent passing.\nSpanning 1,300 square feet, the two-bedroom, two-bathroom residence boasts panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County, all framed by its distinctive geometric design and pristine original features.\nExposed redwood rafters, refinished oak floors, a copper fireplace, and period details like grass cloth wallpaper and bubble lampshades have been meticulously preserved since its construction more than six decades ago.\nOstwald, a Berlin-born architect who transitioned from law to design, left his mark on the Bay Area with his Swiss-inspired functional aesthetic. Known for blending homes seamlessly with their natural surroundings, he collaborated with California luminaries like Richard Neutra, while also designing local landmarks such as the Bancroft Center and St. John\u2019s Presbyterian Church.\n\u201cWhat dental hygienist can commission a home in Berkeley in this era?\u201d Nishimura quipped, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare property. There are a bunch of [midcentury] homes in the area but this is one of the most unique.\u201d\nAnd it was a lure for many.\nThe buyer pool ranged widely, from \u201cyoung professionals who are enamored with [midcentury] architecture\u201d to architects and designers of all ages.\nThe winning bidder, who offered $1.6 million, had a personal connection to Ostwald\u2019s work.\n\u201cThe buyer fell in love with the architect by visiting a friend\u2019s home designed by the same architect, so when this became available they really wanted [it],\u201d Nishimura said.\nThe Berkeley Hills location didn\u2019t hurt either, with neighbors like Robert Reich, the journalist Michael Pollan, and director Michael Lewis adding a touch of star power to the community.\nAll this said, and as for the broader market, Nishimura sees a resurgence.\n\u201cThe luxury market in San Francisco is coming back strong. And top neighborhoods in the East Bay are doing very well,\u201d she said. \u201cThere continues to be such a dearth of inventory and this is such a desirable place to live that competition remains fierce for the best homes.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

But he\u2019s best known for creating the \u201cvertically integrated\u201d system, in which all powerful studios owned the talent (actors, writers, producers) \u2014 as well as the distribution network and theaters that exhibited the films.\nZukor also once owned more than 300 acres in Rockland County, New York, including this farmhouse that was built in the 1930s and expanded in 1944, said listing broker Richard Ellis of Ellis Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nKnown as Mountain View Farmhouse, the six-bedroom, 4\u00bd-bathroom home is located at 374 South Mountain Road in New City, NY, and sits on 6.7 acres.\nZukor once invited guests such as Mick Jagger to attend screenings on the larger estate.\nOther guests at screenings included sculptor John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, architect/painter Henry Varnum Poor \u2014 and composer\u00a0Kurt Weill and his wife, the Tony Award-winning actress/singer Lotte Lenya.\nThe sellers bought the home for $944,000 in 2017. It then underwent an $800,000 renovation in 2019. The current owner, who declined to be named, called it a \u201cpeaceful country escape with the most amazing beech trees, magnolia, ducks, herons and egrets visiting the pond, just 30 minutes from Manhattan.\u201d\nAt 4,740 square feet, the residence opens to a great room with glass walls. An open chef\u2019s kitchen leads to a large slate patio that runs along the back of the house.\nThe main bedroom suite is on the first floor with an adjacent den; additional bedrooms are on the second level. There\u2019s also a guest suite above the garage.\nDesign details include hand-hewn beams, interior sandstone and brick walls, leaded glass windows, panel doors, 12-foot ceilings and two fireplaces. Outside, there\u2019s a pond, a tennis court, a basketball court and grass lawns with magnolias, dogwood, weeping beech trees and more.\nThe home is also close to High Tor State Park, a 691-acre area with hiking trails and views of the New York City skyline.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Say goodbye to the days of snagging a cheap starter home in South Florida. That ship has sailed, and it\u2019s been replaced by a yacht for millionaires.\nBack in the day \u2014 particularly five years ago in the early days of COVID-19 \u2014 $1.1 million got buyers a fancy house and a spot among the top dogs. Now, they need $2.6 million just to keep up, and even that won\u2019t buy much. The little guy\u2019s dream of owning a home down there is pretty much kaput.\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 and they\u2019re brutal.\nIn Palm Beach County, 24% of houses sold last year went for $1 million or more, according a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. Miami-Dade is close behind at 23%.\nThings are speeding up, too. Long-affluent Palm Beach had a 56% jump in million-dollar sales this past December, the biggest spike since May 2021. TheMiami Association of Realtorssays high-end homes are taking over the market, and there\u2019s no stopping it.\n\u201cSouth Florida still doesn\u2019t have enough inventory to meet demand,\u201d says Eddie Blanco, the 2025 Miami Chairman, in the report. \u201cWealth migration to Miami remains high. Buyers from high-taxed, high-density states continue to move here for our jobs, weather and lifestyle.\u201d\nCash rules everything around here \u2014 West Palm Beach was No. 1 in the US last year with 49.6% of sales paid in full upfront, while Fort Lauderdale and Miami hit a respective 38.9% and 38.1%, according to ATTOM.\nThat\u2019s great if you\u2019re loaded, but if you\u2019re stuck with a mortgage and languishing high interest rates, good luck.\nCheck out January 2025: Miami-Dade\u2019s $1 million-plus house sales went up 3.1% to 164 deals, and the middle price for those homes jumped 7.1% to $675,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a jaw-dropping 184.2% more than it was in January 2015.\nCondos aren\u2019t cheap either \u2014 their middle price crept up 2.3% to $415,000, nearly 120% higher than a decade ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the spring market off to a healthy start, with sales and prices broadly up from one year ago,\u201d says Miami Realtors chief economist Gay Cororaton in a report. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving the market is the upper price tier, with strong growth in the $600,000 and over and million-dollar market.\u201d\nFor the super-rich, it\u2019s a feeding frenzy.\nIn Miami-Dade, the price for a top 5% house shot up 22% in 2024 to $3.3 million, and the top 1% \u201cultra-fancy\u201d ones hit $10 million, a 38% jump, perMiami MLS data.\nCondo prices for the big spenders climbed too \u2014 $2.3 million for the top 5% and $6.3 million for the top 1%. Golden Beach is king with a middle million-dollar price of $8.7 million, followed by spots like Bal Harbour ($3.1 million) and Pinecrest ($2.6 million).\nBut starter homes? They\u2019re history.\nSure, some cheaper condos are selling\u2014$200,000 to $250,000 ones went up 10.3% to 75 sales, and $400,000 to $600,000 ones rose 4.7% to 178 in January 2025. But with barely any homes to buy \u2014 inventory\u2019s down 9.9% from normal, and condo listings are 27.3% below pre-COVID days \u2014 it\u2019s slim pickings.\nFlorida\u2019s trying to help with a law pushing developers to build affordable homes, but it\u2019s not enough when the wealthy keep pouring in.\nBottom line: South Florida\u2019s a millionaire\u2019s paradise now. They\u2019re scooping up huge homes with cash while average Americans are having trouble getting their foot in the door. With home equity gains almost double the national average \u2014 $542,175 in Miami-Dade from 2009 to 2024 compared to $310,232 nationwide \u2014 becoming a homeowner there is growing increasingly difficult.\nAdvertisement",

I\u2019d better at least mention it.\u2019\u201d\nThe deal paid off \u2014 literally.\nThe property rents for $272 an hour through Peerspace, with a six-hour minimum, though Thoy kept mum on exactly how much Netflix shelled out.\nDuring filming, the production crew relocated her family to a bare-bones rental, but Thoy and one of her sons couldn\u2019t resist sneaking back to watch their home morph into the Webb family\u2019s base.\nA bonus perk is when the crew built a shed in the garden \u2014 where Paapa Essiedu\u2019s character Elmore Fitch meets his grisly end \u2014 and left it behind. Her son now uses it for music and gym gear, freeing up her garden room.\nThe house\u2019s history adds another layer of charm.\nHistorian Melanie Backe-Hansen uncovered that it was built for William Morris, a retired surgeon who lived there with two servants until his death at 66. His sisters took over next, followed by a string of residents, including naval captain Halton Stirling Lecky in 1939.\nOnce surrounded by countryside, the mansion\u2019s views have since been gobbled up by London\u2019s sprawl.\nListed withMark Breffitof Hamptons Estate Agents, the nearly 6,000-square-foot gem features a gravel terrace with outdoor dining and a grassy lawn framed by plant borders.\n\u201cWith its gated entrance, off-street parking and an expansive south-facing garden, this property offers a rare combination of privacy and space in the city,\u201d Breffit said in a statement.\n\u201cAnd for those who appreciate a touch of glamour, the house\u2019s starring role in a popular Netflix show adds an intriguing element to its already impressive pedigree.\u201d Breffit said in statement.\nBut despite its star turn and her family\u2019s affection, Thoy is ready to downsize now that her kids have flown the nest, adding that her family loved living in the neighborhood \u2014 but that the house got too big for just her and her husband.\nAdvertisement",

Its cabanas once hosted the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Madonna, but a decade of neglect succeeded by Hurricane Irma in 2017 put an end to the hotel\u2019s heyday.\nNow, an ambitious remodel is giving the luxurious seaside getaway a second wind as Rosewood The Raleigh,theDaily Mail reported.\nThe Raleigh Hotel was built in 1940 on the cusp of Miami\u2019s post-war boom. It was heavily featured in the boundary-breaking 1996 box office hit \u201cThe Birdcage,\u201d starring Williams and Lane, as well as the recently deceasedGene Hackmanand Hank Azaria.\nThe film, based on the 1979 farcical French film \u201cLa Cage Aux Folles,\u201d follows a gay couple \u2014 portrayed by Williams and Lane \u2014 whose son is marrying into the family of a conservative senator, played by Hackman.\nThe hotel was also favored by the late Karl Lagerfeld, who premiered Chanel\u2019s resort line along the Raleigh\u2019s iconic coast-of-arms pool in 2008.\nThe hotel will once again open its doors to Miami\u2019s rich and famous thanks to the $1 billion overhaul by developer Micahel Shvo, whose SHVO company purchased the down-on-its-luck property with a group of developers in 2019.\nRenownedarchitect Peter Marinogave the 60-key hotel a refresh, and constructed a 17-story residential tower next door. The Raleigh will be managed by Rosewood Hotels, a luxury hotel and resort company.\nThe newly constructed glass tower will host 40 coveted waterfront residences. These units range in size from two to five bedrooms and will run you anywhere from $10 to $150 million, the Daily Mail reported.\nThe luxurious homes boast large terraces, stone flooring and bathrooms with refrigerators just for beauty products. The revamped hotel next door will continue to offer high-end amenities including a full spa, a fitness center and a private beach club.\nThe Rosewood collaboration marks a second chance at life for the landmarked hotel. The property was previously owned by Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s Hilfiger Hospitality, but the destruction of Hurricane Irma in 2017 closed the hotel in the midst of much-needed repairs.\nMove-in day for the residences is expected to arrive in late 2027. Shvo told the Daily Mail that \u201cmost\u201d of the residences have already sold to cash offers, with a total of $250 million in pre-sales so far.Such a high uptake would be an impressive feat amidFlorida\u2019s softening housing market, which saw a record number of unsold listings in January.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A distinctively lithe home in Central London is on the market for $1.62 million.\nAt just 7 feet wide, the pale green residence is considered the second skinniest home in London, Jam Press reported.\nIt still manages to squeeze in two bedrooms and two bathrooms across three floors, despite its diminutive size.\nWhat the home lacks in width, it makes up for with Arts and Crafts-style charm. From a dragon headed-drain pipe to a rare outdoor terrace, this compact home contains a big personality.\nThe London listing, which is held by Unique Property Company, jokes that the Kensington flat was \u201cvery much an early adopter\u201d of the tiny home trend. The brick facade was built in 1930 and underwent renovations in the 1950s.\nVisitors are immediately greeted with the kitchen and dining area, which the listing claims has a \u201cTardis-like feel\u201d thanks to high ceilings. The dining area connects to a bathroom and the first of the two bedrooms. Glazed double doors at the rear greet a \u201csliver of a garden.\u201d\nUp the narrow stairs is a cozy drawing room with exposed floorboards, a decorative fireplace and just enough space for a love seat. This floor boasts access to a roof terrace \u2014 a rarity in London that adds much-needed breathing room to the home. The listing photos show room enough for an outdoor bench, table and chairs.\nWhile $1.62 million is by no means cheap, home prices for the skinny home\u2019s Peel Street, Holland Park neighbors averaged almost $3 million in 2024, according to the UK property portal Rightmove.\nThe final floor just barely fits another petite double-bedroom and an ensuite bathroom.\nTwo other London flats are tied for the city\u2019s skinniest home, both measuring 6 feet in width. One of them, an apartment building, sold a two-bedroom flat in 2023 forjust under $1 million.\nAdvertisement",

Tuff Shed prebuilt most of the interior and the two balconies and patio. Cook\u2019s floor plan was all in her head.\n\u201cI\u2019d tell them, put the window 2 feet from the door,\u201d she says.\nThe couple, who have no formal construction training, hired professionals for the crawl space foundation, electric, plumbing, and spray foam insulation. The lot already had a well and septic tank. A builder made sure everything was up to county house code.\nThe \u201cshome\u201d (combination of \u201cshed\u201d and \u201chome\u201d) ended up with two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, two balconies, a full kitchen with a gas range and a large sunken island, laundry closet, and large patio.\nThe stylish but homey interior is Cook\u2019s vision, a look she calls \u201ca blend of farmhouse and beach house\u2014even though it\u2019s on a lake.\u201d\nWhere Cook could have gone with drywall for the ceilings and walls, she insisted on tongue and groove and shiplap.\n\u201cI did that shiplap all by myself,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt came out beautiful, but it took a long time.\u201d\nThe unfinished kitchen cabinets were stock from Lowe\u2019s that Cook painted sage green to complement the green-infused Brazilian granite countertops that she fell for despite their hefty $6,000 price tag.\n\u201cI just like what I like,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything came out the way I saw it in my head.\u201d\nCook also found vintage and Hobby Lobby pieces to jazz up the farmhouse-inspired decor (mostly bought from Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot).\nThere are also the whimsical touches such as the fish sink in one bathroom and a video arcade game in the kitchen. The floors are vinyl plank with custom carpet on the stairs and upper floors, to make them more kid-friendly.\nWhen a plumber left a drain line for the upstairs bathroom bulging from the kitchen wall, Richard improvised, building a matching sage-green birdhouse over the stove to stylishly conceal it.\nNot wanting to waste any space in the 1,296-square-foot shed, Cook added a half-bath under the stairs, along with a \u201cclubhouse\u201d for her grandkids.\nThe cost to turn a shed into a home was approximately $170,000 (minus the shell).\nThe couple lived in it for six months while carrying out the renovation. They decided to list it so they could move on to their next project: a barndominium.\nThe shed-house received many offers and was sold over the asking price at $460,000.\nEven so, Cook feels if she\u2019d waited six months, \u201cI could have gotten an extra $100,000.\u201d\nShe also believes the home was priced too low because it can be listed only as a one-bedroom, despite having two, due to the home being on a \u201cone-bedroom septic.\u201d\n\u201cThat hurt us on the appraisal,\u201d she says. However, the lake-view location definitely helped the home\u2019s popularity.\nCook admits, \u201cWe made a lot of money off it.\u201d\nSo did the buyer, whosoldit in March 2025, closing at $505,000.\nAs to whether Cook will make a career of turning sheds into swoon-worthy homes, she laughs.\n\u201cIf somebody hired me, I\u2019d probably want to. I know my husband and kids want me to.\u201d\nDaughter\u00a0Amanda McCormick, who made the TikTok reels showing off her mom\u2019s work, has bigger ideas.\n\u201cI want her to get a TV show,\u201d she says.\nAdvertisement",

That rarified access, combined with the unit\u2019s ornate 19th-century details, make this listing an extra hot commodity.\nMoreover, that price buys a prime piece of city history. The building at 34 Gramercy Park East claims the title of the oldest surviving co-op in the city, according to architectural historian Andrew Alpern. The 10-story, 45 unit residence was built in 1883 \u2014 the same year the Brooklyn Bridge opened.\n(Co-ops, as opposed to condominiums, are where buyers own shares in the building, rather than the real property of the homes themselves.)\nResidents in the Queen Anne-style building covet not only its prime location and ornate decor.\nThe apartment is in the same landmarked building where British model and actress Cara Delevingnebought Jimmy Fallon\u2019s four-unit triplexin 2022 for $10.8 million. Actor Richard Gerealso purchasedan eight-floor condo there in 2016 for $2.25 million.\nThe for-sale unit is located on the entry floor of the building, and spans around 1,900 square feet. It includes three flexible bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus a salon and kitchen. The listing, held by Lynne C. Lerner of Compass, describes the unit\u2019s \u201chistoric charm,\u201d with Gilded Age architectural details that transport residents to \u201can era of elegance and refinement.\u201d\nThe apartment\u2019s entrance speaks to the grandeur within, featuring non-original parquet flooring with an intricate, inlaid marquetry border, as well as a hand-painted Chinese wall covering. A park-facing salon includes original hardwood floors, an opulent chandelier and a marble fireplace at its focal point. Thirteen-foot ceilings span the apartment.\n\u201cYou see 13 foot ceilings in a lot of modern buildings and some loft conversions, but it\u2019s beautiful to see it in the building of this era,\u201d Lerner told The Post.\nThe lacquer-red primary suite includes a striking floor-to-ceiling chifforobe and an en-suite bath covered in green marble tiles. A second bedroom, currently used as a den, is floor-to-ceiling mahogany, featuring an original fireplace and shuttered windows with stained glass detailing.\nThe final bedroom includes yet another fireplace and even more Gilded Age details in its molding and trim.\nThe home last changed hands in 2004,whenreporter Stone Phillips, the former co-anchor of Dateline NBC, sold the unit to a man named Michael Stotsky, according to city records.\nThe lobby itself is a sight to beyond, with a Tiffany glass ceiling and mosaic tiling. Despite its opulence, 34 Gramercy Park East comes from humble origins. The red brick and terra cotta facade was constructed as a middle class alternative to tenement housing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique property, and very well preserved,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cIt kind of transports you back to 1883.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

That deal now marks the most expensive apartment ever sold downtown, narrowly beating the 2018 record set by billionaire Robert F. Smith\u2019s$59 million penthouse purchasein Chelsea.\nThis recent off-market transaction not only met the sellers\u2019 exact asking price, but also earned them double what they paid for the unit in 2016.\nThe deal was closed on Thursdaythrough a co-listing between Jim St. Andr\u00e9 of Compass and Peter Zaitzeff of Serhant. The Wall Street Journalfirst reported on the sale.\nThe 5,840-square-foot waterfront apartment boasts views of the Hudson River and a large outdoor terrace. While it\u2019s a notable deal for the downtown area, it\u2019s far from the city\u2019s \u2014 and the nation\u2019s \u2014 priciest home sale. Ken Griffin\u2019s roughly $238 million purchase of a multi-story residence inside 220 Central Park South in 2019 continues to hold both of those records.\nThis just-sold home at 150 Charles includes five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms. While little about the interiors of the unit has been advertised, the listing photos show a spacious, modern home with ample natural light and a neutral color palette.\nAn eat-in kitchen features marbled countertops and a backsplash, and a spiraling staircase adds artistic flair to the home\u2019s minimalist design.\nA Serhant promotional video for the listing from November also flaunted$500,000 parking spacesbelow the building.\nThe sellers are financier Harsh Padia, of Hap Capital Advisors, and his wife,interior designer Purvi Padia. The pair bought the apartment in 2016 from the building\u2019s developer, Alex Witkoff, for $29 million. The Padias sold the unit to an unidentified buyer.\nThis isn\u2019t Padia\u2019s first downtown sale. Harsh Padia previously owneda 5-story penthouse at 471 Washington St. that he sold in 2021 for $17.6 million, according to the city register.\nThe 15-story, full-service building at 150 Charles St. is highly coveted real estate in its historic West Village neighborhood. Witkoff opened the 91-unit building in 2013 \u2014 and A-listers includingBon Jovi, Ben Stiller,Ryan Seacrestand Irina Shayk have since called it home.\nThe full-service building includes concierge services, a gym and a private courtyard.\nAdvertisement",

Packed with cutting-edge tech, the penthouse even includes a Savant smart home system for effortless control.\nSarah Williams, the founder of Societe Real Estate, held the listing and declined to comment on the sale. Representing Hafner were Michael Duchon and Eloy Carmenate of Corcoran, who also declined to comment.\nHafner co-founded Kayak in 2004 alongside tech whiz Paul English, turning it into a go-to metasearch engine for flights, hotels, car rentals and vacation deals.\nThe platform, which first hit the web in 2005, evolved from its original name, Travel Search Company, Inc., to Kayak Software Corporation later that year.\nBefore that, Hafner cut his teeth in the travel industry by helping launch Orbitz in 1999, where he spearheaded business growth, ad sales and marketing.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Winter in New York City often enjoys a cooler real estate market, but not this year.\nRenters in Manhattan were met with record-high rents in February, with a median rent of $4,500 \u2014 a 6.4% uptick from the same time last year. Prices also rose in Brooklyn and Queens as vacancy rates tightened,a new reportfrom Douglas Elliman revealed.\nEveryone, from renters to agents, is feeling the heat.\n\u201cThe fact is, there\u2019s not a lot of room to negotiate,\u201d Douglas Wagner, BOND New York\u2019s director of brokerage services, told The Post.\nThe early bird no longer gets the worm when it comes to applications, either.\nIt\u2019s all about who can offer more, according to Laurel Ferrera, an agent at Keller Williams NYC. Units are advertising at low prices to whip up interest, Ferrera said in an email, and then taking as many applications as possible.\n\u201cA place on the Upper West Side that was initially marketed at $3,700 for a one bed, one bath ended up being rented for $800 above asking,\u201d Ferrera wrote. \u201cThe agent told me, \u2018The people who got their apartment [are] willing to go higher if needed.\u2019\u201d\nA quarter of Manhattan deals in February sparked bidding wars, the Elliman report found, also marking a record high. Experts blame the increased competition, in part, on an uncertain economy, skittish homebuyers and back-to-office mandates.\nFerrera\u2019s recent client, Alex K. \u2014 who didn\u2019t reveal her full name for privacy \u2014 thought starting her apartment search in February would give her the upper hand. She was quickly disabused of that theory.\n\u201cI\u2019d always heard that winter is a lot easier to find places,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cBut everybody just seems to want to come back to the city now.\u201d\nAlex, who is moving from California to New York for work, said she and Ferrara looked at more than a dozen apartments across Brooklyn and Manhattan. In the process, she ended up in four separate bidding wars.\nOne of the bid-upon units was a Cobble Hill one-bedroom that, Alex said, someone else paid $800 above the asking price for.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure some people have dual incomes, but it\u2019s just me, and I can\u2019t compete with that,\u201d Alex said.\nThe Elliman report found February\u2019s Brooklyn listings had even fiercer competition than Manhattan, with35% of deals resulting in bidding wars.\nCompared to Manhattan and Brooklyn, housing inventory in Northwest Queens saw a generous increase. The103% uptickin available listings in February may have contributed to a higher rate of the borough\u2019s landlords willing to make concessions, eager to attract choosier tenants. Still, bidding wars were documented in a fifth of all deals in Queens.\nThe Elliman analysis also documented a faster rise in the median rent of non-doorman buildings than doorman buildings. Wagner said he has noticed renters aspiring to more outfitted, upgraded apartments, and he said they\u2019re willing to give up an amenity, like a doorman, to get those features.\n\u201cIf the non-doorman apartment is well-equipped, and there\u2019s a washer-dryer in the apartment, and the rooms are not tiny, it makes a huge difference,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cPeople will maybe give up the idea of a doorman and a health club to save a little bit of money, if they can get something better than an Easy Bake kitchen.\u201d\nIf an apartment today is equipped well and priced well, Wagner said, there will be a line out the door.\nWagner predicts an even hotter summer for the market, with prices remaining high and units staying competitive.

        "content": "Five Years Later\n\n\n\n Lessons for the next pandemic\nFive years ago this week, Boston was unrecognizable. Its normally bustling streets were deserted. Its office towers and arenas empty. Its restaurants dark. The days stretched to weeks, then months, of wondering when the people would come back.Eventually, they did.Five years after COVID shut down Boston, things feel, by and large, normal again. There are lines at lunch spots, crowds at the Garden, college kids at the bars. But the city isn\u2019t the same.Measures of foot traffic and office vacancy haven\u2019t fully rebounded. Hybrid work remains pretty common. Car traffic is worse. Empty storefronts persist.But more than anything, we just don\u2019t mix like we did before.A Northeastern University study of cellphone data found that when COVID hit, inhabitants of Greater Boston became far less likely to interact with people of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Those numbers have been recovering, but for many parts of the region, particularly in the suburbs, levels of what researchers call \u201csocial exploration\u201d have fallen sharply.\nAdvertisementAnd that\u2019s bad news for a city whose culture and economy have, for centuries, been built on people mixing, connecting, and sharing ideas, said Northeastern University physicist Esteban Moro, who\u2019s leading the study. Bad enough that it raises questions about what cities like Boston are for, now, and how we make them places that people connect once again.\u201cCities are these social engines that put together people,\u201d Moro said. \u201cThis is the purpose of the city, right?\u201dRelated: Five Years Later: Lessons for the next pandemicThese days, that engine isn\u2019t working like it used to. Moro and his colleagues at Northeastern\u2019s Social Urban Networks Group track the movement of people across cities, and when they look at Greater Boston they see, basically, less movement. Generally, people in the most affluent suburbs are staying in their affluent suburbs. People in the region\u2019s lower income corners stay there, too.It\u2019s an indicator of the diminished role that downtown plays in the daily lives of Bostonians. According to recent figures from the Downtown Boston Alliance, about 20,000 fewer people work downtown than did five years ago, and they come in, on average, about three fewer days per month. Add it up, and the work trips into the core of the city district have fallen by almost half.AdvertisementIt\u2019s the sort of challenge Boston has faced before, said Karilyn Crockett, a former city director of economic policy and research who now teaches urban planning at MIT. In the 1950s and \u201860s, as residents decamped to the suburbs and jobs followed, Boston responded by constructing skyscrapers that signaled to the world that the city was a place for doing business. It\u2019s time, Crockett said, to find a new signal.A view of the Boston skyline at morning. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\u201cThe fundamental thing that we\u2019re asking is where are people?\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is the center of gravity in the city, whether for shopping or for hanging out or for work? Where do people come together?\u201dIncreasingly, that\u2019s neighborhoods where people do more than work. While foot traffic downtown remains below pre-pandemic levels, according to city data, it\u2019s nearly back citywide, and up in places such as Fenway and Longwood. What\u2019s the difference? These \u201cmultipurpose\u201d neighborhoods, as Moro describes them, provide chances to live, work, and play in more equal measure.That\u2019s something the Wu administration is trying to do downtown, offering a generous tax break to help convert underused older office buildings into housing. Mayor Michelle Wu said the city has received applications to convert 20 buildings into 760 units of housing, 153 of which will be income restricted.Related: \u2018The lockdowns were never really effective\u2019: New research shows COVID stay-at-home orders did more harm than good\u201cEvery building that comes back to life makes a difference,\u201d Wu said.Even office buildings that aren\u2019t being converted are seeing new life.Take 63 Franklin St., an old bank headquarters in Downtown Crossing. In December, job-training nonprofit Breaktime paid $6.3 million to buy it to house their 40-plus employees, a health clinic, and retail space where the teens Breaktime works with can hold jobs \u2014 showing how a downturn in office values can open new doors for new ideas.AdvertisementThe city\u2019s trying other things too, like doling out $10 million in federal COVID relief funds to help 90 small businesses find a toehold in empty storefronts, and pushing Beacon Hill to provide 225 new liquor licenses, which it will distribute across the city to spur new restaurants in all corners of Boston.But these efforts are fighting an uphill battle.The empty floors of a downtown office building and streets below as the city of Boston emptied out on March 13, 2020.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffTakeout orders were prepared at Soleil in Roxbury in 2021. The restaurant had to turn to takeout during the pandemic. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe pandemic accelerated a shift toward online shopping that was taking hold well before COVID, and the rise of takeout \u2014 in place of restaurant meals \u2014 has persisted, too, Moro\u2019s data shows. Remote work and even hybrid arrangements mean people congregate less often downtown, for both work and play.People like Brenda Bond-Fortier, a professor in the Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University, who studies organizational change and has witnessed it herself in the wake of the pandemic.Bond-Fortier used to spend her days downtown, at Suffolk. Today, she\u2019s teaching her graduate classes online, from her home in southern New Hampshire, and ventures in just two days a week. She misses the bustle of Boston and seeing her colleagues, but she doesn\u2019t miss spending 10 hours a week in the car.\u201cI\u2019m very blessed where I have job with a bit more flexibility in terms of when I do and don\u2019t go to the city,\u201d she said.Related: Six things we got wrong about COVID-19, from washing groceries to herd immunityTo Crockett, even the word \u201cdowntown\u201d feels a bit archaic, as it implies we\u2019re all going to the same place. In this more splintered age, we aren\u2019t.Advertisement\u201cIf people are going to venture out of their home for any reason,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s to have a particular experience.\u201dAnd experience is a big part of how developers aim to draw people out now. Food halls, for instance, are springing up across the city, not just catering to office workers seeking lunch but also tourists, families, and after-hours crowds into the night.Visitors can ride a tube slide in between floor levels at the Museum of Ice Cream in the Seaport.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffA slew of for-profit \u201cInstagram museums\u201d and immersive art experiences have recently taken up residence in hollowed-out storefronts. A Harry Potter exhibit has lately drawn throngs to an empty old Best Buy at the CambridgeSide mall. \u201cCompetitive socializing\u201d is all the rage in the Seaport, where different venues offer mini-golf, ping pong, bowling, pickleball, or darts. And the recent arrival of new spaces where people can both shop and linger \u2014 be it at Beacon Hill Books & Cafe, or the batting-cage-boasting Dick\u2019s House of Sport in Back Bay \u2014 are models for how businesses can transform an errand into an event.Even small businesses are attempting to be a little bit of everything.Related: \u2018We really never came back to each other\u2019: Five years after COVID, we\u2019re more divided than everIn the wake of the pandemic, Justin Sorbo and two colleagues left their longstanding jobs at gym chain Equinox to open Pearl Street Fitness training studio in the Financial District. The gym\u2019s owner, David Cheal, purchased a former convenience store and renovated it into a boutique gym where customers can linger after workouts on tufted leather couches, sipping whiskey or getting a trim from one of the visiting barbers that pass through. His goal was to create a \u201dthird space\u201d for clients to hang out in, and to work from before or after sessions.AdvertisementAt Pearl Street Fitness, owner David Cheal works with a client. He said he wants to create a \u201dthird space\u201d for clients to hang out in, and to work from before or after sessions.\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff\u201cThe entire thing is to facilitate relationship-building of different kinds and having strong bonds and connections with people,\u201d Sorbo said. \u201cNormal face-to-face interactions are something that\u2019s becoming sparse in the area of remote work. We\u2019re definitely shooting for a tighter community here, and we do have that.\u201dBut there\u2019s a catch. All of these new places are private spaces, and many of them quite pricey.That\u2019s a challenge in a city that aspires to be for all of its people, said Ted Landsmark, director of Northeastern\u2019s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. Cities, after all, aren\u2019t just blocks and buildings, but places where \u201cjoyful interactions\u201d can bring people together.Related: More than 1 million Americans have died of COVID-19. Why is there no national day to remember them?\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on public leadership to encourage those kinds of informal interactions,\u201d Landsmark said, \u201cparticularly around entertainment, shopping, play, and culture.\u201dThat can take various forms, he said, from public art to public gatherings \u2014 both of which the Wu administration has experimented with \u2014 to lowering T fares on weekends to draw more young people downtown. It can mean ensuring that major developments include space for civic life \u2014 such as the popular new plaza atop the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Lyrik building. And it can mean making more of the public spaces Boston is fortunate to have, especially along Boston Harbor, where longstanding efforts to increase access still have a ways to go.A pedestrian walked through the Lyrik Plaza area built for people to gather that is part of a new development built over the Mass. Turnpike.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe Fenno/Gomez family, of Boston, visited the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, on the launch day of Boston Family Days. Family Days is an expansion of the BPS Sundays pilot program that allows free access to museums, zoos, the ICA, and other attractions.  Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\u201cOther cities have activated their waterfronts,\u201d more than we have, Landsmark said. \u201cWe still tend to underutilize our location on the ocean.\u201dBoston\u2019s waterfront is just one untapped resource. The city is also looking to increase access to its world-class cultural institutions, and attempting to find ways to make them feel more welcoming to people from across the city.That\u2019s the idea behind Boston Family Days, a program Wu launched in 2024 and expanded this year. It allows any family in Boston with children to visit any of nine museums on the first two Sundays of each month for free. Over 44,000 people participated in 2024, and 11,000 more have signed on this year.\u201cEvery young person in the city deserves to feel at home in every part of our city,\u201d Wu said.Related: During COVID, vaccines were the path to \u2018herd immunity.\u2019 Now, a growing number don\u2019t want to be part of the herd.Indeed, Wu said, we all know what cities need to thrive. Even kids. Every year, Wu meets with a kindergarten class at the Boston Society of Architects, and organizers ask the kids to design a model city. You might think they\u2019d draw skyscrapers, Wu said, but the kids had other plans.During a recent showcase, the mayor recalled, one child drew gigantic beds \u2014 so everyone would have a place to sleep \u2014 another designed a free ice cream store, and a third a massive owls\u2019 nest. Why? So the owls can come out at night and catch all the rats.\u201cEven at a young age our kindergartners understand our cities have to be safe, beautiful, welcoming and fun,\u201d Wu said. \u201cEspecially now, when everything does feel so disjointed and isolated, people are looking for experiences to have together.\u201dThat\u2019s what cities have always been for. Before that week they shut down five years ago. And still today.\n\n\nHow we reported this story\nThe \"social exploration\" data in this story come from an analysis by a team of researchers from the Social Urban Networks Lab at Northeastern University\u2019s Network Science Institute. They are: Esteban Moro, Hamish Gibbs, and Bijin Joseph.\n\r\nTheir analysis examines movement patterns across the core Boston metro Area, leveraging millions of anonymized and aggregated visits derived from mobile phone data. The researchers measured the proportion of movements occurring between areas (census block groups) with different income levels, defined using income quantiles based on median household income estimates from the US Census Bureau.\r\n\nThe changes depict the shift in social exploration, aggregated by ZIP code, between 2019 and 2024.\r\n\n\nYoohyun Jung and Catherine Carlock of the Globe staff contributed to this report.Janelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com.

        "content": "\u201cSouthern Charm\u201d personality Madison LeCroy has snagged a buyer for her Charleston, South Carolina digs just 10 days after slapping a $1.75 million price tag on it, The Post has learned.\nThe final sale price, however, has not yet been disclosed as the sale has not yet been finalized.\nLeCroy bought the spacious 2,800-square-foot abode, boasting four beds and four baths, in April 2022 for $1.48 million, according to property records.\nThe home first hit the market on March 7. It entered contract on March 17.\nTim Schneider with The Cassina Group held the listing, but could not comment on the final sale price while the home sale remains pending.\n\u201cRenovation and interior design can be a daunting task \u2014 homes like this one that strike that balance between being ultra-specific versus needing everything sell very quickly,\u201d Schneider told The Post. \u201cA few potential buyers even asked if they would sell the home with the furniture and the gym equipment.\u201d\nLocated on Daniel Island, the home sports double front porches, brick steps and a crisp new exterior on a quiet street.\nInside, there are white oak floors, an airy open layout, a living room with a gas fireplace \u2014 and a chef\u2019s kitchen decked out with green cabinets, quartz counters and stainless steel appliances. The pad also features a den, a full bathroom, a screened porch with modern touches and a deck.\nUpstairs, the primary suite comes with its own porch, dual walk-in closets, a luxe tub and a big shower, plus two more bedrooms, another bathroom, laundry and attic space.\nA bonus room above the garage \u2014 complete with a kitchen, a bedroom, a living area, a bathroom and laundry hookups \u2014 serves as LeCroy\u2019s dressing room. The two-car garage, now with a slick epoxy floor, doubles as a personal gym.\nThe quick sale coincides with LeCroy\u2019s big news: she\u2019s expecting her second child, her first with husband Brett Randle, 38. The baby girl is due this summer.\n\u201cHonestly, we\u2019ve loved this house, but it\u2019s time for something that fits where we\u2019re headed next,\u201d she toldthe Daily Dish. \u201cLife\u2019s changing, our family\u2019s growing, and I\u2019ve got big dreams, so why not level up?\u201d\nLeCroy\u2019s already eyeing her next Charleston-area home with Randle.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say \u2026 it\u2019s exactly what we need,\u201d she wrote in an email to the outlet. \u201cMore space, more charm and plenty of room for our family to grow.\u201d\nThe mom of 12-year-old Hudson says she\u2019s pumped to renovate again and plans to bring fans along for the ride.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got everything we\u2019ve wanted and then some, so get ready because y\u2019all know I\u2019ll be making it perfect!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course, I\u2019ll be sharing every step of the way, so stay tuned!\u201d\nThough Randle splits time between California and the East Coast for work, LeCroy\u2019s sticking close to home.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going far!\u201d she added. \u201cCharleston is home, and it\u2019s where we want to raise our children. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Renters across the U.S. can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for the time being, asrent pricesnationwide have fallen for the 19th straight month\u2014but a looming construction shortage could spell trouble in the near future.\nThe median asking rent price across the 50 largest metros slid to $1,691 in February, shedding $15 compared with the same time a year ago, writesRealtor.com\u00aesenior economistJoel Bernerin theFebruary 2025 Rental Report.\nEven though the rents have been gradually decreasing over the past year and a half, the bad news is that Americans are still paying much more for housing than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic, when the national rent was over 14% lower.\nThe declining rental rates have been a double-edged sword because they have made building multifamily housing less appealing to investors over the past few years.\nAccording to Berner, that could result in lower rental unit inventory going forward and, in turn, cause rent prices to go up.\nIn 2024, fewer than 294,000 units in multifamily rentals were permitted for construction across the 50 largest metros from coast to coast, the lowest number since 2017.\nEven at the height of the pandemic in 2020, there were more units permitted, at 318,000.\n\u201cThis represents a major retreat in multifamily construction permitting, no doubt due to the fact that rents were falling year over year throughout 2024,\u201d says Berner.\nAccording to economists\u2019 projections, if the supply of new rental units continues dwindling, as the latest permitting figures suggest, the downward trajectory of rent prices may not be sustained.\n\u201cWe expect rents to start to grow again in the coming years as the pace of new units hitting the market slows,\u201d warns Berner.\nNew York Cityin February earned the dubious honor of having the highest annual rent growth of any metro in the U.S.\nThe median rent for an apartment in New York City climbed to an eye-popping $2,977, up nearly 7% from the same time last year, and more than $1,000 than the current national median.\nThe dramatic price surge followed a slight dip in multifamily permitting in New York City, which saw 42,230 construction permits issued in 2024, a downtick of 9.5% from 2019.\n\u201cWe expect rent to continue to rise in the Big Apple for this reason,\u201d notes Berner.\nNine other major metros experienced rising rent prices amid a dearth of permitted multifamily units, includingBaltimore,Boston,Detroit, andSan Jose, CA.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom when it comes to rental supply. The latest data analyzed by Realtor.com researchers showed a lot of regional variation in inventory and rent price levels.\nNine of the top 50 metros experienced a boost in multifamily permitting in 2024 than the previous five years at the same time that rents decreased year over year.\n\u201cWhere demand is already weakening and supply is expanding, we anticipate more significant downward pressure on rents,\u201d according to Berner.\nA typical rental unit inSan Diegosaw its monthly rate plunge by 6%, to $2,667, after the number of permitted multifamily units in the city jumped by nearly 19% in 2024.\nBirmingham, AL, saw a similar trend, with the median rental price dropping by 5.4%, to $1,165, following a 22% upswing in construction permitting.\nAlthough Denver saw a sizable 41% decrease in multifamily construction last year, the city\u2019s median rent experienced the steepest annual drop of all the metros in February, shedding 6.4%, to arrive at $1,773.\nStudio rent prices generally tend to be volatile, but in February they matched one- and two-bedroom unit rent growth compared with the same period a year ago, at a level of just above -1%.\nA typical studio unit in February had a median rent of $1,413, down 0.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the median rent for a one-bedroom unit was $1,583, while a two-bedroom apartment could be rented for $1,887, with both of those figures representing a 0.7% annual decrease.\n\u201cThis is due to the market stabilizing in a pattern of consistent price retreat,\u201d explains Berner.\nA zoomed-out view reveals that studio units have had the smallest rent growth from five years ago, at 9.7%, as two-bedroom apartments have had the steepest uptick in rents, at 18.3%.\n\u201cStronger long-term rent growth for larger units could be attributed to the fact that fewer young renters are becoming first-time homebuyers amid high home prices and high mortgage rates, andfewer young people are forming independent householdslikely living with roommates instead, keeping demand for larger rentals elevated,\u201d says Berner.\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -6.4%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,773\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -6%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,667\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -5.4%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,165\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -4.8%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,462\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.6%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,071\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.5%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,458\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.3%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,293\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.3%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $2,678\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.1%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,492\nYear-over-year change (0-2 bedrooms): -3.0%Median monthly rent (0-2 bedrooms): $1,170\nAdvertisement",

Really, I didn\u2019t even think something like this could happen.\u201d\nBut it did. After Turner\u2019s ex-husband,\u00a0Keith \u2014 a long-haul trucker \u2014 left the house unattended for a period of time, two strangers,\u00a0Aaron Polmanteer\u00a0and\u00a0Lledera Hollen, forced their way in.\nOnce inside, they found personal documents belonging to the Turners, forged new ones, and assumed their identities.\n\u201cSquatters stole my house,\u201d Turner said, still in disbelief. \u201cThey actually moved in, posed as me, and sold my house.\u201d\nWith fraudulent paperwork in hand, Polmanteer and Hollen successfully listed and sold the home to real estate investors for $200,000 \u2014 all without the Turners knowing.\nThey might have gotten away with it too, but they ran into trouble when they tried to cash checks written out in the Turners\u2019 names.\nPolmanteer and Hollen now await trial, and Turner\u2019s home is back in the right hands. But the story highlights a growing trend of criminals selling property without the homeowners knowing about it. Here\u2019s how to guard yourself against this disturbing crime.\nYour keys give you physical access to your home, but yourtitlesecures your legal right to it. That right is recorded on adeed, the legal document that proves who holds ownership.\nIn a legitimate real estate transaction, the title transfer is carefully overseen by areal estate agent, title company, and notary to ensure everything is properly documented.\nBut fraudsters know how to manipulate the system, sometimes slipping through these safeguards undetected.\nJust ask Turner. By forging documents and impersonating her and her ex-husband, Polmanteer and Hollen were able to fool a title company and notary.\nBy the time Turner realized what had happened, the property had already changed hands on paper.\nWhen Turner saw the forged documents, she was stunned. \u201cThat is not my name, and that\u2019s not my signature,\u201d she said in an interview with ABC 15 Arizona. \u201cHow does this happen? At what point did someone not do their job?\u201d\nTitle fraudis on the rise and can happen to anyone, but properties that are vacant or mortgage-free are at the greatest risk.\nWithout proactive safeguards, homeowners may not discover their title has been stolen until long after its changed hands.\nMonitoring your property is essential to combat title theft. Many counties, including Maricopa County where Turner\u2019s home is located, offer free notifications whenever a document is recorded in your name.\nThis means if someonefraudulently files a deed transferon your property, you\u2019ll be notified immediately, giving you a chance to notify authorities.\nAnother way to catch fraud before it happens is to set up a simple Google alert for your address.\nBad actors sometimes list stolen properties for sale before homeowners even realize something is wrong. A Google alert will notify you any time your address is mentioned on the web.\nA title company\u2019s job is to ensure a property changes hands from seller to buyer without hidden issues like fraud.\nAs part of this process, they conduct thorough research into the property\u2019s history, checking for outstanding mortgages,liens, judgments, or unpaid taxes that could affect ownership.\nOnce they confirm a title is clear, the company compiles a title report and issues title insurance, which protects buyers from financial or legal trouble if hidden claims or fraud surface down the road\u2014like in the Turners\u2019 case.\nWhile fraud isn\u2019t always preventable,title insurancecan serve as a financial safety net, ensuring that homeowners and buyers aren\u2019t left paying for someone else\u2019s deception.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nThe fraudsters who stole the Turners\u2019 home were able to do so after accessing personal documents that helped them forge ownership records.\nWhether your home is occupied or vacant, taking simple precautions can help prevent this type of theft:\nIf you think someone has tampered with your home\u2019s title, act fast. The sooner you catch fraudulent activity, the better your chances are of reclaiming ownership.\nBy acting quickly and leveraging the right legal and investigative resources, you can work toward reclaiming your property.\nAdvertisement",

Over the next two decades, fourteen mill houses were lost to decay, the boarding house was demolished, and the abandoned site took on the appearance of a ghost town.\u201d\nThe official website notes that the main mill was believed to have burnt to the ground because of a lightening strike.\n\u201cHenry River is an example of history that seems so distant, yet it can still be seen, touched and heard with our own eyes and ears,\u201d the site reads.\nThe current owners, who are known only as Henry River Mill Village LLC, purchased the property in October 2017.\nAt the time of filming, there was a different owner.\nFans of the film franchise may be able to see the village on the big screen again soon asSuzanne Collins, author of \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d novels, revealed that the fifth installment,\u00a0\u201cSunrise on the Reaping,\u201d will hit shelves March 18.\nThe movie adaptation will debut in theaters in November 2026.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "San Jose, CA,\u00a0is cracking down on \u201cvanlords,\u201d whom city officials say are \u201cbad actors\u201d charging the homeless to live in dilapidated, nonworking vans.\n\u201cThis is a problem that flies under the radar, but my office has heard directly from residents about exploitative vanlords taking advantage of desperate renters searching for affordable housing,\u201d Councilmember\u00a0David Cohen\u00a0tells Realtor.com. \u201cThese rentals use city property to take advantage of vulnerable tenants without having to follow tenant protections for rental properties that protect the safety and financial well-being of lower income people.\u201d\nCohen\u2019s office sent Realtor.com photos of Facebook Marketplace listings showingRVs illegally for rent.\nOne had a monthly rent of $1,300 and another for $800.\nThe listings were active, and only a couple of many such listings. Some vanlords may charge even more.\n\u201cBy creating an ordinance to outlaw these rentals, we set an expectation of appropriate behavior,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cOur goal is to prevent this crisis from worsening, by shining some light on the situation before it becomes unmanageable.\u201d\nSaid Councilmember\u00a0Bien Doan\u00a0at a March 12 meeting addressing the issue: \u201cWe know there are bad actors out there that put dilapidated, nonworking van trailers or RVs out there, and then manipulate our unsheltered residents to rent these places inunsafe conditions, without any preparation for biohazard or hazardous waste or even a fire hazard.\u201d\nAccording to the\u00a0San Jose Spotlight, there are \u201ctwo known individuals\u201d who are renting out at least 20 motor homes to homeless people.\nIn 2023, police officers discovered one of these vanlords had purchased four to six RVs from a tow yard, set them up on Educational Park Drive and Las Plumas Avenue, and was charging people rent to live in them. According to the city, this activity is illegal.\nA September 2024\u00a0memofrom Chief of Police\u00a0Anthony Mata\u00a0sent to the City Council said that most of the RVs parked on the streets of San Jose did not belong to any of the houses nearby but were \u201cunregistered and unofficially owned by unhoused individuals who are using them as shelter.\u201d\nPolice said they had received hundreds of complaints about the vehicles, but that in general, it was not city policy to tow the vehicles if they were being used as shelter by individuals.\nPolice cited \u201cconcerns about individuals illegally placing RVs on public streets and renting those RVs to unhoused individuals.\u201d\nIt noted that the city of Los Angeles was taking action to curb \u201cvanlording activity\u201d by drafting an ordinance that would prohibit leasing and renting out RVs if they were parked on public streets.\nThe memo stressed that the police department was concerned about the vanlords, not the renters.\n\u201cThe focus of the issue is not the unhoused individuals living in the RVs, but rather the persons renting them and illegally placing them in public space to generate personal income,\u201d said the memo.\n\u201cThe City has an interest in enterprising individuals preying on the unhoused population of the city and capitalizing on their misfortunes by renting them RVs that have not passed safety inspections andlack basic plumbing and sewage removal.\u201d\nHowever, police say the vanlord issue doesn\u2019t seem to be widespread, and most people living in the RVs were not paying rent.\n\u201cThere does not appear to be a significant number of private individuals leasing or subleasing RVs to multiple people,\u201d said the memo.\nSan Francisco, Long Beach, San Diego, and Fresno have noted similar issues with RVs parked illegally on the streets. However, according to the same police memo, they are not taking action to prevent it at this time.\n\u201cStaff\u2019s research indicates that \u2018vanlording\u2019 is not currently a pervasive problem in San Jose,\u201d it said.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Doan and Councilmembers\u00a0Michael Mulcahy\u00a0and\u00a0David Cohen\u00a0from wanting to prevent the issue entirely.\nThe Rules Committee\u00a0recommended studying the problem and reporting back to the City Council in two weeks.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nAt least one RV resident,\u00a0Rudy Ortega, said he believes the crackdown is all about\u00a0Mayor Matt Mahan\u00a0wanting to sweep the streets of homeless people before an important event.\n\u201cHe wants to clear the streets of the homeless [before] the Super Bowl,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI think it\u2019s done purposely. It\u2019s another one of his tactics.\u201d\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled to be held Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, which is a 15-minute drive from downtown San Jose.\nOrtega, who lives in an RV parked near Columbus Park and is apparently not renting, filed a restraining order against the city in 2022. However, a judged ruled he had to leave the area anyway.\nThe city has held a series of \u201csweeps\u201d meant to clear the streets of homeless encampments and illegally parked RVs, butmost homeless\u00a0simply return\u00a0to swept areasafter a certain amount of time.\nOrtega had a camper parked on the streets that reportedly was full of dead rodents.\nIt\u2019s unclear where exactly Ortega is living now, but he told the San Jose Spotlight that he knows of only one individual who is renting an RV. He points out that the real issue isn\u2019t the RVs but the unaffordability of housing.\nMeanwhile,Juanita Macias\u00a0told\u00a0ABC7that she once rented an RV for \u201c$500 every month\u201d and it didn\u2019t include electricity or water.\nMany of her \u201cneighbors are still renting RVs,\u201d she said, with landlords charging about \u201ca thousand, $800 sometimes.\u201d\nThe median home list price in San Jose is an eye-popping $1.4 million, well above the national median of\u00a0$400,500\u00a0as of February, according to\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae. Renting is no better. The median rent is $3,180.\n\u201cBy restricting the sale, rental, or even transfer of RVs, you\u2019re targeting one of the last remaining options for shelter that unhoused individuals can afford,\u201d Ortega said at the recent City Council meeting.\n\u201cInstead of punishing those who seek shelter in RVs, the city should focus on providing real humane housing solutions.\u00a0If safety is the\u00a0concern, then provide sanitation services in designated areas with proper oversight, not further displacement.\u201d\nBut Cohen insisted that the issue isn\u2019t the homeless but the vanlords.\n\u201cOur concerns are for people who are putting out old, inoperable vehicles and then renting them to people to live in, as opposed to people who own their own RVs\u2014which is not at all the target of this potential ordinance,\u201d he said.\nRealtor.com reached out to Doan, Mahan, and local homeless nonprofit organizationHomeFirstfor comment.\nAdvertisement",

Recent data fromRealtor.com revealedfive red-hot US metros where single-family homes are selling the fastest, and they\u2019re all coastal hubs.\u00a0Despite rapid-fire sales, however, median listing prices declined across the board.\nHomes in San Jose, California topped the list with a median shelf life of just 22 days on the market. That\u2019s well below the nationwide median of 66 days. The San Jose market is highly competitive and consistently ranks among the nation\u2019s most expensive. Single-family homes in the Silicon Valley city clocked in at a median price of $1.3 million in February.\nJust an hour\u2019s drive away is the country\u2019s second hottest market \u2014 San Francisco. Home prices in the notoriously pricey city by the bay hit a median cost of nearly $900,000 in February. The typical San Fran home only stayed on the market for 30 days last month.\nAcross the country, the third fastest-moving market was Boston, where homes lingered for as little as 33 days. Beantown sold big in February, with a median asking price of $839,450.\nBesides Boston, Washington, DC is the only other metro outside of California that made the list. Properties in the nation\u2019s capital tied with San Diego for a median of 34 days on the market.\nHomes in sunny San Diego listed for a median of nearly $950,000. Properties in DC listed for around $580,000 last month, but tides may be turning for that market. All eyes remain onthe ongoing real estate impactsof mass federal worker layoffs.\nThis recent data comes from Realtor.com\u2019smonthly report on housing market trends. Despite the high demand seen in metros like San Jose and Boston, monthly data over the past year has broadly revealed a shift towards a buyer\u2019s market.\nPrices have slowed even in the top five fastest-selling metros. According to Realtor.com data, every single one of these cities saw year-over-year median listing price declines, ranging from a 9% drop in San Francisco to 1.8% dip in Boston.\nThe total number of for-sale nationwide homes is nearly 30% higher than last year, according to the February\u2019s report, and the total number of unsold homes increased in the same period by almost 20%.\nAdvertisement",

Walser Jr. House, a rare Prairie-style relic nestled in the Austin neighborhood, is one of just five surviving Wright designs of its kind in Chicago \u2014 and it\u2019s teetering on the edge of collapse after years of neglect.\nEvery spring, the folks at Preservation Chicago drop theirChicago 7 list, spotlighting the city\u2019s most endangered architectural treasures, which includes this very property.\n\u201cThe Walser House had been on our watchlist of buildings for several years,\u201d Ward Miller, the group\u2019s executive director, toldArtnet News.\n\u201cThe vacancy of the building, along with the visual inspection of the building\u2019s interior and noting both the water damage and vandalism, lead us to make this a priority and emergency advocacy effort.\u201d\nThis architectural stunner was whipped up in 1903 for printing bigwig Joseph Jacob Walser, with Wright keeping costs low at $4,000 \u2014 about $150,000 in today\u2019s figures.\nIts design includes wide eaves, a breezy layout, custom furniture and dazzling art glass windows. But now, the place is deteriorating. The last owners, Anne and Hurley Teague, scooped it up in 1970.\nHurley, a contractor, worked diligently to keep it standing until he passed away 1997. Anne followed in 2019, and since then, the house has been left to rot, battered by Chicago\u2019s notoriously brutal weather.\n\u201cThe house has been unoccupied and unmaintained for the past six years,\u201d thePreservation Chicago\u2019s websitesays.\nEven with some patchwork fixes and brush-clearing by do-gooders, the whole property is screaming for a top-to-bottom overhaul.\n\u201cEvery part of this house needs attention,\u201d\u00a0TheFrank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancyadded on its website, asking for someone to swoop in, shore it up and bring it back to life.\nDesignated a Chicago Landmark in 1981 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, the house can\u2019t be torn down \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe from falling apart.\nA reverse mortgage from 2003 and ongoing foreclosure fights are gumming up the works, according to theAustin Weekly News.\n\u201cThis needs to occur quickly,\u201d Miller told Artnet. \u201cThe home is very susceptible to environmental conditions and also to people breaking and entering onto the property.\u201d\nWith advocacy crews like Preservation Chicago and the Conservancy keeping tabs, they\u2019re pushing hard to speed up the legal mess.\nA new owner could tap into federal and state tax breaks to fund the fix-up, but the clock\u2019s ticking.\n\u201cIts longtime owners tried their very best to maintain the home, despite the costs associated with some of the various needs and requirements, as they continued to age,\u201d Miller toldArchitectural Digest.\n\u201cWe need the community to voice their support for this amazing house and be a partner in its restoration, repair and revival.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also pleading with City Hall to help fund the resurrection of Wright\u2019s vision before it\u2019s too late.\nAdvertisement",

More than 3.2 million people call the state home, according to an estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau.\nOhio is the second-most affordable state when it comes to getting a home, with Canton, Youngstown and\u00a0many other Ohio locales\u00a0seeing affordable prices, per Redfin. The real estate company pegged the state\u2019s median sale price at $231,400 and its median monthly housing payment at $1,472.\nRedfin said Oklahoma ranked No. 3, with homes there selling for a median $236,700.\nThe Mountain State boasts a median sale price of $243,100, according to the analysis. It derives its nickname from the well-known Appalachian Mountains that run through it.\nHouseholds in Michigan earn a median of $71,149, Redfin reported, citing the U.S. Census Bureau. Its No. 5 spot for buying a home is thanks to its $248,000 median sale price.\nMississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Indiana and Arkansas were the five other states that Redfin ranked among the 10 cheapest when it came to homes.\nMeanwhile, with homes going for a median of $785,200, California earned 50th place on the ranking, meaning it was the priciest state, the analysis found.\nSome Americans have had difficulty purchasing homes in recent years amid the housing affordability crisis that the U.S. has been contending with.\nLast month, a survey released by Bankrate found 81% of Americans \u201cwho have owned a home in the past or never owned a home but want to some day\u201d called down payments and closing costs a \u201csignificant obstacle\u201d to getting a place.\nAbout 76% ofaspiring homeownersestimated the amount of time it will take them to sock away sufficient funds for a house down payment at one year or more, according to Bankrate.\nMany U.S. adults \u2014 75% \u2014 still consider homeownership to be a component of the American Dream, Realtor.com found in a separate January survey.\nAdvertisement",

But for someone who\u2019s looking to score a home in Brookline\u2019s coveted Fisher Hill neighborhood, the petite pad might be just what they\u2019re looking for.\nOriginally part of a single property with a two-family home next door, the property was condo-ized in 1984. The space was\u00a0likely a caretaker cottage for the larger property\u2019s staff. Now, it functions as three independent homes in the same HOA.\n\u201cFunctionally, it works more like a single-family home, even though it\u2019s part of the association,\u201d saysMatt Montgomeryof the Matt Montgomery Group at Compass, who has thelisting.\nA stone walkway with a mature tree on the side leads up to the home, which greets visitors with its main living space. Bright, white walls and wall-to-wall carpeting run throughout the 181-square-foot living room, which features three windows. To the left is a wood-burning fireplace, which was previously closed off for renters but could be updated to fully function once again. A closet, the sole one in the home, features a water heater and storage space.\nA ladder leads up to the sleeping loft, which is home to four-foot ceilings.\n\u201cThe sleeping loft incorporates probably two-thirds of the roof line,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cIt\u2019s quite large up there.\u201d\nContinue into the 56-square-foot kitchen, which features engineered hardwood flooring and stainless steel appliances. A larger window over the sink, which has double cabinets below, looks outside. There are several other wooden cabinets and room for a butcher block.\nTo the left is the 30-square-foot bathroom that features a shower, as well as a window looking outside.\nThe land is all common, but unit 3 has a small outdoor space to enjoy on their own.\nThe home\u2019s proximity to Brookline High School, the Brookline Reservoir, and the MBTA makes it an ideal spot for a commuter. There is a designated parking space for the unit at the end of the driveway.\nThe\u00a0$75 monthly HOA fee pays the\u00a0unit\u2019s share toward master insurance, water, sewer, and snow removal, and has 10% ownership in the entire property.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Hold off on that big expansion for now.That\u2019s the bottom line for the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center in an extensive report prepared by a team of consultants led by hotel specialist Pinnacle Advisory Group, and shared with the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority board on Thursday. The consultants say that it would not be wise to pursue a long-planned $1.9 billion expansion to the convention center until more hotels get built nearby. Specifically, the Pinnacle team suggests an additional 800 to 1,000 new rooms need to be built in the Seaport that are \u201ccommittable\u201d to the MCCA \u2014 that is, the authority has access to room block agreements in the hotels, or full control of them \u2014 before the ambitious expansion should proceed.The team did point to a scaled back option as a doable alternative: a nearly $500 million addition that primarily consists of a second ballroom. This addition, Pinnacle said, could accommodate groups and local events, generate incremental extra revenue for the MCCA, and help Boston compete for conventions against other cities. The ballroom addition could include some space to showcase local companies and groups, the Pinnacle report suggested, hopefully driving more business to Boston-area vendors.Separately, a developer submitted a letter to the city of Boston\u2019s planning department this month describing plans for a 15-story hotel with 438 rooms to be built behind the Aloft and Element hotels across D Street from the BCEC \u2014 a project that potentially could go a long way toward meeting the need Pinnacle identified. (The developer also proposed renovating the Element, as part of the filing, increasing the total room count at the two smaller hotels to 530 from 510.)AdvertisementGovernor Maura Healey\u2019s administration commissioned the Pinnacle report last year after replacing a majority of the MCCA\u2019s board members and halting plans to sell or lease six-plus acres near the BCEC to a developer. Pinnacle was charged with analyzing the potential for all of the MCCA\u2019s properties, though there\u2019s not much room for expansion at either the Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay or the MassMutual Center in Springfield. (The report does provide supporting evidence for holding on to the Hynes, which could benefit from $300 million-plus in capital renovations over an 11-year period, instead of redeveloping it as proposed by Healey\u2019s predecessor, Charlie Baker.) The MCCA has considered different expansion concepts for the BCEC under previous governors, but now it\u2019s up to the Healey administration and new MCCA executive director Marcel Vernon to guide the facility\u2019s future.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

Some candidates: Zeus. Athena. Hercules.\n\nThe reason? This 43-unit condo complex was created out of a Classical Revival-style,Greek temple-likechurch built in 1926 that still has a front entry of three wide steps of granite, four massive limestone columns, a pediment, and a raking cornice of limestone. It was a Catholic church until about 2004, and was converted into residential housing in 2008.\n\nBoston magazine \u2014 which is now owned by The Boston Globe \u2014 recentlynamed Cambridge the top place to livein Greater Boston, and this Cambridgeport condo checks all the boxes.\n\n\nThis unit is built into the pediment, and from the living room, a wooden door with glass windows opens to a Juliet balcony with views of those columns andthe egg-and-dart moulding.\n\nTake the elevator to the walk-through for this fourth-floor duplex,starting with the entry door that leads to an open floor plan for the first of two levels in the home. The stairwell to the upper level is on the immediate left, but ahead is the kitchen, dining area, and living room that together create a wonderful setting embellished by the cherry flooring.\n\n\nThe 185-square-foot kitchen is galley style, which makes it an efficient space for the cook in the family. On the left is a bilevel counter with multiple outlets and the sink. On the other side of the counter is seating for three. On the left side is the refrigerator, gas range with an above-range microwave, and more counter space. The cabinets are cherry and the backsplash is multi-colored mini subway tile.\n\nThe kitchen flows into a dining area that is defined by a circular light fixture hanging from the ceiling. A large black-framed double-hung window on the exterior wall throws its light onto the dining table, with currently has seating for six.\n\n\nHere is a reason to stop and gawk. A wooden doorway holding large slabs of clear glass opens to the private deck. It provides an excellent perch to mull divine thoughts \u2014 or sip coffee in the morning.\n\n\nThe living room completes the open floor plan area. It\u2019s 400 square feet and along the right side, there\u2019s a trio of windows, all of which can be opened. Adjacent is a stand-alone window perfect for a potted plant. There is recessed lighting.\n\n\nFormed from the bell tower, there is now a 47-square-foot windowless office.\n\nThe living room moves past the door to the Juliet balcony and ends in a 35-square-foot half bath with tile flooring and a single vanity.\n\nOn the upper level is the primary suite, the second full bath with a laundry closet, the second bedroom, and a hallway closet.\n\n\nThe 204-square-foot primary bedroom is on the left side of this level. It\u2019s carpeted, has recessed lighting, and a support beam crossing the ceiling. Natural light comes from a set of three windows inset into the thick walls.\n\n\nTwo steps leads up to the closet that was formed from the original pediment, making it seem more like a small stage than a placid place for storage. It\u2019s 26 feet longand shelving is located at either end.\n\nThe primary bath is just on the left of the entry. It\u2019s 52 square feet and it has a single white vanity with a counter. Directly ahead and behind the clear glass door is the shower with a rectangular shower head. The backsplash and floor is mosaic tile and the walls are slabs of tile.\n\nThe second bedroom is 166 square feet, has carpeted flooring, and its own set of black-framed windows on the exterior wall. The closet is a standard design with a single door.\n\nThe second full bath is 103 square feet and has a pair of white porcelain pedestal sinks, tile flooring, and a shower/bath combination with a white subway tile backsplash. Shower splash is reduced by the use of a half-glass shower door.\n\nThis home comes with a concierge, an assigned and deeded underground parking space, private storage space, and access to a courtyard, gym, and shared rooftop.\n\nJoe Maiorana of the Steven Cohen Team of Keller Williams Realtyin Boston has the listing.

        "subhead": "Cindy Stumpo's status hasn\u2019t come without obstacles.",
        "content": "ByMadeline Bilis\n\n\nC. Stumpo Developmentsits on a small stretch of Route 9 in Chestnut Hill. From the outside, it\u2019s a nondescript brick building with a green awning, but on the inside, the office of the company\u2019s founder is anything but. There, Cindy Stumpo sits at a large white desk under a sparkling chandelier. Large black-and-white photos of her projects line the walls, showing a series of opulent interiors.\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d she told me, waving me over to watch a video on her phone. \u201cI took this yesterday.\u201d\n\nShe pressed play on a short clip at a construction site where she\u2019s teasing some of the contractors. \u201cThe homeowner is leaving,\u201d she announces in the video, laughing.\n\nStumpo put the phone down, explaining that one of the men on the site asked her if she was the property\u2019s homeowner. But she\u2019s able to find the humor in it \u2014 once she can set him straight, that is. It\u2019s a typical interaction for Stumpo, who\u2019s been labeled as \u201craw\u201d and \u201cuncensored.\u201d She doesn\u2019t hesitate to speak her mind, and never has.\n\nStumpo is usually quick to tell you she started her company in 1989 when she was 23 years old. After growing up in West Peabody, then in Newton, she earned a degree in general construction fromWentworth Institute of Technology. She traces her love for homes and homebuilding to a childhood infatuation with Christmastime, looking at light displays on impressive homes in neighboring Lynnfield.\n\n\u201cAt 14, I would say to my grandmother, \u2018Oh my God, look at those Christmas lights. Why are those Christmas lights so much prettier than other Christmas lights?\u2019\u201d said Stumpo, who\u2019s now 60. \u201cMy grandmother goes, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re seeing.\u2019 Then, as I got older, I figured out I was looking at roof lines.\u201d\n\n\nWhile she couldn\u2019t identify a hipped roof or an A-line at the time, she now sees that admiring those shining rooflines \u2014 and the stately houses \u2014 sparked her interest in homebuilding. Later, when she decided to start her own business, she realized she didn\u2019t want to be just a custom homebuilder. Stumpo rejected the idea of letting the market dictate who would hire her and who wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI knew it was going to be a hard road. Who\u2019s going to hire a 23-, 24-, or 25-year-old girl, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSo I had to go out and learn how to be a developer and a builder: Buy the land, develop the land, then go build. Then the end user would come and buy.\u201d\n\n\nAlmost immediately after she founded C. Stumpo Development, sexist comments started flowing. One early client asked to speak with her husband, who he assumed owned the company. A broker advised her to pretend that her husbanddidown the company in order to close the deal, but she refused.\n\n\u201cIf you can think of it, I\u2019ve been through it,\u201d she said.\n\nStumpo said she spent the first few months in the field keeping her head down and being careful with her delivery to both clients and contractors. Soon, she learned authenticity would take her further. Stumpo attributes part of her success to her directness and no-nonsense attitude.\n\n\u201cI realized within six months, \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank-yous\u2019 did not work out here,\u201d she said. As for what got her point across more easily on jobsites? More expletive-laden requests.\n\n\n\u201cI realized that this is Boston. This is the way we talk,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go \u2018Bless your heart.\u2019 We just don\u2019t do that, right? So that\u2019s just what it was.\u201d\n\nThese days, Stumpo acknowledged, the homebuilding environment is not as outwardly hostile to women. Still, there\u2019s work to be done for championing women in such a male-dominated industry.\n\nShe points to her daughter Samantha, who now works with her. Together, they\u2019re among one of the only second-generation female-led construction companies in the country.\n\nFor 20 years, Stumpo also has overseen a summer internship program for students interested in building. \u201cThe girls are always like, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\u201d she said. Stumpo encourages younger generations to get into the trades \u2014 especially young women. \u201cIf I knew that I was going to go down this avenue, I would have absolutely 1,000 percent went to vocational school,\u201d she said.\n\nStumpo carves out a few hours most Thursday nights to chat on the phone with two or three girls she mentors. And when she isn\u2019t working with early-career women, she\u2019s usually speaking to them, either on social media or through her WBZ NewsRadio podcast, \u201cTough as Nails.\u201d On air, she tackles subjects ranging from panic attacks to menopause, embracing openness and honesty for her listeners.\n\nHer main advice to women entering the field is simple: Don\u2019t ever let a man tell you you can\u2019t do something. \u201cYeah, I can mentor you. You can watch for me from a distance. But you have to have the confidence \u2014 I can\u2019t give that to you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to find that inner strength.\u201d Inner strength, it seems, is something Stumpo has channeled long before she ever started her company.\n\nLooking back on her career, I asked her if she had any wisdom for her younger self, or if she\u2019d do anything differently. Her answer was swift:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a goddamn thing.\u201d\n\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

The new owner\u2019s identity, as well as the price to be paid, are not yet available.\nMoore, the trailblazing star of her eponymous \u201970s sitcom \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d passed away in 2017 at Greenwich Hospital at age 80, leaving behind a legacy \u2014 and this palatial estate.\nStanding on 7.37 acres, the property boasts five bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a glass conservatory, a Jacuzzi, an elevator and a gym with spa amenities.\nOutside is a 65-foot pool and fireplace, while a separate one-bedroom apartment sits above the three-car garage.\nLevine, who poured his heart into the home alongside Moore, opened up about its allure in an email to Hearst Connecticut last year.\n\u201cThe house is special to me because it is a house that Mary and I designed, with specific intention to make it welcoming, filled with natural light, open to the outside (so you feel a part of the natural surroundings), with intimate, purposeful spaces that offer comfort and a platform for display of her favorite things, including her many and diverse collections of objet d\u2019art.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt is, unquestionably \u2018Mary\u2019s house\u2019 well reflecting her classical design aesthetic and passion for detail and use of the finest materials and artisanal methods of construction.\u201d\nThe sale comes in a market where Redfin clocks the area\u2019s median home price at $2 million as of June, with the hottest properties fetching 6% above asking and flying off the market in just 15 days.\nJoseph F. Barbieri of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty held the listing. The Post has reached out for comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Soaring home coasts are driving Florida legislators to propose radical solutions.\nMedian home prices in metros across the Sunshine State have surged in recent years alongside home-insurance premiums. In light of the crushing financial pressures on Floridians, lawmakers are now debating the reduction or total elimination of property taxes,the Wall Street Journal reported.\nThere is no US state that has successfully eliminated property taxes, althoughNorth Dakota tried and failedto become the first with a ballot measure in November. Florida is among eight states without individual income taxes, however, making it especially attractive to retirees on fixed incomes. The incentive has also brought companies \u2014 and their billionaire owners \u2014 to the growing state.\nBut the state\u2019s housing market hasn\u2019t been so sunny lately, as skyrocketing property values, condo fees and insurance premiums are pinching some Floridians\u2019 wallets. Despite success in the state\u2019s high-end luxury market, the number of unsold homes in Floridarose almost 23% year-over-year in January.\nIncreasingly property valueshits fixed-income households, like retirees, particularly hard. Redfin data cited by the Journal tracked median home prices in metros like Miami, Orlando and Tampa increasing several times over since 2012.\nNow, some Florida lawmakers are angling to address the issue by taking aim at the state\u2019s property tax, from a full repeal to smaller adjustments. The actual likelihood of such radical measures coming to fruition is unclear, but the issue has been front and center this legislative session, the Journal reported.\nThese measures include Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s plan to put a constitutional amendment abolishing or reducing property taxes on 2026 ballots, as well as State Sen. Jonathan Martin\u2019s bill requiring a study on eliminating property taxes by October. Two bills aimed at a reduction in property taxes were introduced by State Rep. Ryan Chamberlin.\nCritics of the proposals say that eliminating property taxes would force cuts to essential services and significantly hike sales taxes. Property taxes are a dominant source used by local governments for public services like schools, fire departments and libraries. In Florida, property taxes make up a significant slice of county, municipal and school district revenues, the Journal reported.\nPoliticians like DeSantis and Chamberlin have suggested various remedies to avoid the loss of revenue, including reducing waste in local government and increasing sales taxes.\nAlthough the elimination of property tax could help keep Floridians on fixed incomes in their home, it might also hurt their day-to-day spending. The Journal cited a study by the Florida Policy Institute that estimated the state\u2019s sales tax would need to be doubled to 12% in order to replace property tax revenues.\nOther states are also considering reducing or eliminating property taxes, the Journal reported, including Wyoming, Kansas and Montana.\nAdvertisement",

Recent aerial photos,first reported by Realtor.com, show their main home gutted and the nearby day cottage \u2014 in which the couple once hosted a gratis one-night Airbnb stay \u2014 razed to the ground.\nThe changes come at a quiet time for the couple, who have largely remained out of the spotlight following personal controversies over their words of support for actor and convicted rapist Danny Masterson \u2014 and Kutcher\u2019s past ties to disgraced music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs.\nThe couple purchased the two-home getaway in Santa Barbara County for $10.1 million in 2017, according to Realtor.com. The Arroyo Burro Beach home counts stars like Kevin Costner and George Lucas among its neighbors.\nThe property was originally built in 1991, according to Zillow. The 6-acre plot includes a four-bed, four-bath main house and a small cottage close to the sand.\nHeavy rainfall across the state in late 2022 and early 2023 triggered flooding and mudslides in Carpinteria, causing a waterway alongside Kutcher and Kunis\u2019 home to rise up and swamp their property with sludge and debris, Realtor.com reported. The flooding hit other notable properties in the celebrity enclave, including thebeach home of Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian.\nRecent aerial photos show the main house covered in plastic tarps, with its two-story porch, outdoor stairs and chimney gone. The day home is completely torn down.\nTheir beachside home isn\u2019t the couple\u2019s main abode. Kutcher, 47, and Kunis, 41, live in a custom-built Beverly Hills mansion with their two children.

Kutcher and Kunis offered up their day cottage up for a $0 one-night stay on Airbnb in August 2023. In turn, Airbnb made a one-time donation to Kutcher\u2019s anti-child sex abuse charity, Thorn, from which Kutcherresigned one month later.\nThe listing for the two-bedroom Santa Barbara County beach house, titled \u201cAshton & Mila\u2019s Oceanfront Oasis\u201d advertised \u201cviews of the Santa Ynez mountains,\u201d and \u201cno shortage of sights and plenty of activities to make for an unforgettable summer stay.\u201d\nListing photos showed quaint, beachy interiors, a large main bed and another room with bunkbeds. The home also included a small kitchen, a cozy sitting area and a hot tub on a picturesque deck.\nThe listing was quickly snapped up and the Hollywood pair posted videoson their socialsmeeting up with their renters.\nKunis and Kutcher have been otherwise inactive in the public sphere for the past two years. The pair faced significant controversy in 2023 when they wrote character reference letters for their former \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d co-star Danny Masterson during his rape trial, for whichthey later publicly apologized.

        "content": "It took just 82 seconds to make Boston real estate history on Friday.Shortly after 11 a.m. Friday, One Lincoln St. \u2014 a 36-story office tower in the heart of the Financial District \u2014 was auctioned, on the sidewalk, for any and all to see. The highest bidder? The very same entity that gave One Lincoln\u2019s prior owner a mortgage worth $763 million just three years ago. And the price today? Just $400 million.Though the sale hasn\u2019t yet closed \u2014 that can\u2019t happen until an April legal hearing \u2014 it\u2019s the sort of deal that could set a new, far lower, floor for the post-pandemic value of office towers in downtown Boston. And how the deal went down, well, several real estate and legal experts said they\u2019ve never seen something quite like it here before.Related: One of Boston's most recognizable buildings is about to hit the auction block.AdvertisementAbout 40 people gathered to witness the auction on blustery Friday morning at the corner of Bedford and Kingston streets, the same spot where developers broke ground on One Lincoln St. nearly 25 years ago. Third-generation auctioneer Samantha Saperstein of Holbrook-based auction house Paul E. Saperstein Co. played for the crowd a pre-recorded legal notice that lasted more than 10 minutes, even with Saperstein playing it at 1.5 speed, and was chock full of highly specific logistical details like \u201cten seconds east, 163.41 feet along the southerly side of Bedford Street.\u201dSamantha Saperstein with Paul E. Saperstein Co. Auctioneers & Appraisers, conducts an auction of One Lincoln Street on Friday morning.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe crowd mostly stayed put donned in jackets and windbreakers \u2014 though thankfully the cold rain that had poured through downtown in the early morning hours on Friday had passed. A few murmured to each other through the lengthy legal notice. When the recording stopped, Saperstein asked if qualified bidders waived reading a memorandum they had already received, and just one voice spoke up to agree: Adrienne Walker, a partner with law firm Troutman Pepper Locke in Boston who represents one of the tower\u2019s lenders, a bank subsidiary known as MSD RCOF Partners XXXIX LLC.Then the show began.\u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure? Do I hear $500 million? What\u2019s your pleasure? We gotta start somewhere,\u201d Saperstein called out to the gathered group. Heads swiveled, but no one spoke. Saperstein asked for a half-billion-dollar bid twice more before dropping down to $200 million.Advertisement\u201cGotta start somewhere, folks. You\u2019re not gonna get it for that much of a steal,\u201d she said. No one spoke either when Saperstein dropped the price to $100 million. Then she called out a number that was already in hand: $400 million.\u201cSo $400 million I have,\u201d she called, her voice rising above the gusting wind. The next bid she asked for: $450 million. No one volunteered.\u201c$400 million dollars I have once. $400 million dollars I have twice,\u201d Saperstein said, pausing each time. \u201cIs there any advance over $400 million dollars? Third and last call. Fair bidding, fair selling,\u201d \u2014 a line often spoken by her grandfather Paul Saperstein, she said.\u201cThere\u2019s no advance over $400 million dollars? You are satisfied?\u201d she asked the crowd. \u201cSold! $400 million dollars. Thank you all for attending. Everyone go get warm.\u201dRelated: Boston's office market is beginning to wobble.The entire engagement lasted just 1 minute and 22 seconds, though it\u2019s fair to expect the legal discussions behind the sale took much, much longer. The auction itself had even been delayed by 24 hours \u2014 it was originally scheduled for Thursday morning. There was no reason given for the delay, and Saperstein declined to comment.Though the public auction happened on the street corner, there was also action this week in a courtroom in Brooklyn, New York, where Fortis Property Group, which has owned the tower since 2006, asked a judge to block the sale, at least for now. The judge agreed, and set a hearing on April 4, at which point, perhaps, that $400 million figure, and what it represents about the value of one of downtown\u2019s most visible towers, may change.AdvertisementOnlookers at Friday's auction of One Lincoln Street, on Kingston Street in downtown Boston.David L.

Penthouse 406 boasts top-of-the-line amenities \u2014 and, given its height, panoramic views in many directions.\nAs far as luxury sky-high penthouses go, this one at 3 Court Square didn\u2019t spend terribly long on the market. The condo was initially listed for $12,500 a monthin November. The unit was delisted in early January andpopped back upas an$11,500-a-month listing less than two weeks later following a brokerage swap, still cementing its place as the highest-priced rental in Queens. The final price for the deal is not known; unlike sales, final lease deals are not made public.\nSkyline Tower immediately claimed two major superlatives when it opened its doors in 2019. Not only is the 67-story tower the tallest residential building in Queens, it\u2019s also the second tallest building in all of Long Island.\nIf the contract is signed, it marks a new record for Skyline Tower, beating out an $11,000-per-month penthouse rented there in October.\nThe 1,547-square-foot space includes four bedrooms and three bathrooms \u2014 two of which are ensuite.\u00a0 Wraparound, floor-to-ceiling windows offer sweeping skyline views of New York City across the East River.\nIt soars 778 feet above the borough.\nMichael Chadwick of Corcoran, the listing representative, previously called the unit \u201cthe crown jewel of the Skyline Tower Condominium.\u201d\nThe tower offers residents 24/7 doorman and concierge services, a community play area, a roof deck, a game room, a pet spa and a 75-foot-pool and much more. The best part? It\u2019s one subway stop from Manhattan \u2014 useful for the office types who now have to go to their desks at least several days per week.\nUnfortunately for Skyline Tower, the 802-unit building will not carry the crown of Queen\u2019s tallest residential edifice for much longer.

A full wall of glass opens completely for more views, the listing notes. Two additional ensuite bedrooms complete the second level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really special home.

        "content": "Homeownership is a symbol of financial stability for most Americans\u2014but for those living in states where the cost of living is higher, it might seem like they\u2019re working solely to keep a roof over their heads.\nThe median home price nationally is $412,000, according to the Realtor.com\u00a0February 2025 Monthly Housing Trends Report.Homeowners who purchase a homeat that price point will need to work approximately 10 days each month to afford the mortgage payment\u2014and that\u2019s without factoring in any other expenses.\n\u201cHome prices have significantly outpaced wage growth in recent years, widening the gap between income andhousing affordability,\u201d says\u00a0Hannah Jones,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00aesenior economic research analyst.\n\u201cThis disparity intensified during the [COVID-19] pandemic, when a surge in housing demand strained inventory, driving home prices sharply upward and increasing economic pressure on households.\u201d\nHawaii\u00a0has the highest median home list price in the nation at $796,947. Homeowners purchasing a home at this price point will need to work 17 days each month just to cover the payment of $5,222, including tax and insurance. The average hourly wage in January 2025 was $38.\nIn\u00a0California, they face a similar trend, with homeowners needing to work 15 days of the month to cover a payment of $4,773, including tax and insurance. Similarly, homeowners in\u00a0Montana\u2014where the median home list price is $613,275\u2014 would also have to work 15 days of the month.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0West Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Ohio\u00a0have the lowest median home list price, at $247,000 and $259,450, where residents will need to work about 7 and 6 days a month, respectively.\nIn other states, including\u00a0Kansas,\u00a0Missouri,\u00a0Indiana,\u00a0Illinois,\u00a0West Virginia, and\u00a0Michigan, it requires about 7 days of work each month to cover mortgage payments.\nA standard full-time jobmeans working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or about 20 to 22 days per month.\nNearly 75% of U.S. households, approximately 100.6 million, cannot afford a median-priced new home in 2025, priced at around $459,826, according to theNational Association of Home Builders.Even modest increases in home prices or mortgage rates exacerbate this affordability crisis significantly. For example, a mere $1,000 increase in median home prices would make homeownership unaffordable for an additional 115,593 households nationally.\nThe affordability crisis is not just about rising prices; it\u2019s also about a shortage of homes.\nHousing construction has not kept pace with demand, according to arecent U.S. Census Bureau report.\nAnd, the\u00a0housing shortage\u00a0will take 7.5 years to fix at the current rate of construction, according to a new\u00a0report on the housing supply gap\u00a0from the Realtor.com economic research team.\nAlthough the supply gap improved moderately in 2024, the country still fell 3.8 million units short of meeting demand relative to new household formations and pent-up demand, the analysis found.\nIn January 2025, 1.48 million new building permits were issued, but actual housing starts\u2014when construction officially begins\u2014fell to 1.37 million, a 9.8% decline from the previous month.Meanwhile, 1.65 million homes were completed, but the overall supply remains limited, pushing prices higher and making housing less affordable for many Americans.\nThis supply shortage disproportionately affects lower-income and marginalized communities. A recent McKinseyreport\u00a0highlightedthat Black Americans are among the most burdened, with nearly 60% of renters facing moderate or severe housing cost challenges.\n\u201cMore home supply at more price points can help bring earnings and home prices more in sync. Not all households are interested in buying a home, so ample rental and for-sale inventory are both important to providing affordable housing options,\u201d adds Jones.\nData methodology:To assess housing affordability, this analysis calculates the number of workdays needed to cover a median monthly mortgage payment in each state. The estimates are based on median home list prices as of February 2025 and assume a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 6.65% interest rate. Property taxes and insurance costs are factored in using a 1.7% annual rate, and calculations assume a 20% down payment. Wage data is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 January 2025 release, which tracks average hourly earnings across states.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By Beth Teitell, The Boston Globe\n\nIt was frigid out, and so icy that all over townpedestrians were tumbling. But on the 35th floor of the Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center, life felt as easy as a summer afternoon, and Richard Baumert was marveling at the lap pool: 75 feet long, surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, its water a bewitching shade of . . . let\u2019s call itconcierge blue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing laps in the sky!\u201d exclaimed Baumert, the managing partner of Millennium Partners. He sounded as awed as a child \u2014 and as strategic as a developer positioning his building against rival luxury buildings. \u201cThis is a huge draw for people.\u201d\n\nDown on earth, whererents have grown punishingand someBostonians are being pushed from their homes,affordable housing has become a central issuein the mayoral campaign.\n\nBut in the sky \u2014 the city\u2019s new status neighborhood \u2014 the fight is not over meeting the basic needs of life, but over lifestyle. It\u2019s a war of amenities. On beast mode.\n\n\nIn a world where two-bedroom condos routinely go for $2 million plus, monthly homeowners associations costs can run you $2,000 or more, and penthouses sell for tens of millions of dollars, buildings are no longer just buildings. In the words ofRicardo Rodriguez, a Coldwell Banker luxury real estate agent, they\u2019re \u201cvertical country clubs.\u201d\n\nThere are resident-only restaurants run by fancy chefs. Golf simulators that come with a wet bar. Children\u2019s playrooms that are so perfectly staged no children should be allowed. Decks landscaped to evoke the Mediterranean, screening rooms for private movie nights, IV drips, \u201cSuccession\u201d-worthy work spaces, fitness centers with locker rooms more lavish than many homes. Places just for stretching. Service so gracious it spoils you for interactions with members of your own family.\n\n\nAt The Four Seasons One Dalton, not only is the driveway covered, the sidewalks are heated. EchelonSeaport has three pools, one with a waterfall and cabanas; and a basketball court that converts into a pickleball court. At Raffles Boston Residences, there are butlers and perhaps something even better \u2014 a framing for your life that sounds like it was written byDon Draperhimself.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201dthe website reads. \u201cIt is here that we return time and again, after all our voyages of discovery. It is the beginning and end of every journey, a feeling we carry in our hearts, a memory that calls us back.\u201d\n\n\nBut perhaps most important \u2014 and competitive of all \u2014 are amenities for the dogs.\n\nAtTheMillenniumResidences at Winthrop Centerin the Financial District, canine services include aromatherapy facials, ($50), agility training ($300 for six sessions), and luxury boarding at a New Hampshire farm ($105 a night).\n\nDuring a recent tour of the dog spa, Baumert said the building also offers canine acupuncture ($65) and Reiki. As he spoke, Lila, a long-haired Dachshund, looked on, perhaps eager to have her chakras read (for $50), or maybe saddened that she doesn\u2019t live atThe Sudbury in Bulfinch Crossing.\n\n\nThere, in addition to glorious outdoor spaces for humans \u2014 including a pool and an open-air ninth-floor \u201cfront porch\u201d with rocking chairs \u2014 there\u2019s outside space for dogs, too. To run, and also to relieve themselves.\n\n\u201cSome buildings make them go indoors,\u201d said Simona LaPosta, a real estate agent with Advisors Living, who was showing a reporter around. She allowed herself a quick wince, perhaps at the thought of the odor or maybe to drive home a selling point.\n\nMany of the city\u2019s luxury towers have been built in areas that lack the charm of Back Bay or Beacon Hill, but who cares! There\u2019s no need to ever leave (except to fly to your other homes).\n\n\nAs David Bates, a real estate agent with William Raveis, wrote in hislively newsletter: \u201cBostonians once flaunted their social position by living in historic buildings with premier addresses. Today, however, the city\u2019s wealthiest residents can flex their status by owning high-floor residences in Boston\u2019s new residential skyscrapers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the city\u2019s newest luxury tower, theRitz-Carlton Residences, Boston, South Station Tower, is over a train station.\n\nBut no matter. \u201cLife Above the Clouds\u201d is how the location is positioned on the website. \u201cBeginning at an elevation of more than 450 feet\u201d the residences \u201ccomprise a collection of extraordinary private homes and amenities in the sky.\u201d\n\n\nIf we were in New York City, nicknaming convention would practically demand we call this new neighborhood \u201cBoSky.\u201d\n\nJust a generation ago, Boston was a town where even doormen weren\u2019t that common. But in the summer of 2000, the game changed, according to a 2023Globe Spotlight reporton Boston\u2019s housing crisis and the luxury tower building boom. That\u2019s when the Trinity Place condo building opened in Copley Square, with athen-astonishing claim: that life there would bring a \u201cTotal Fulfillment of Needs.\u201d Since then, more than 50 sizable developments featuring multimillion-dollar condos \u2014 both new construction and renovations \u2014 have opened in Boston.\n\nAnd by now, woe to the building that doesn\u2019t offer at least a dog-washing station, indoors though it may be.\n\n\nIn late February, Bates, the real estate agent, did a keyword search for amenities in the 763 condos on the Boston market. The goal was to see what\u2019s become a must-have \u2014 even in nonluxury buildings.\n\n\u201cConcierge,\u201d he said, reading out a keyword. \u201cThere are 224, even some in East Boston. One hundred and forty-one [listings] have apool.Decks, that\u2019s 268.Valet, there are 95. Forty-nine have some kind ofsports simulator.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, with amenity madness blooming, the term \u201cfully amenitized\u201d entered the lexicon (with coinage claimed by power broker Maggie Gold Seelig) and now it\u2019s even arrived in Beacon Hill.\n\n\n\u201cThe Archer Residencesjoined two historically significant buildings to create the first fully amenitized, full-service luxury condominium in Beacon Hill,\u201d reads the website for the seven-story project on Temple Street.\n\nAlas, even in BoSky, sometimes there must be a nod to reality. As the website for Ritz-Carlton Residences over South Station tries to boast, the location provides \u201c. . . immediate vehicular access to I-90, I-93 and the Ted Williams Tunnel.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one nightmare no amount of amenitization can buy you out of: Boston drivers.\n\nChoose a lane, buddy!\n\n\nBe civil.  Be kind.\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston. Receive the latest news and breaking updates, straight from our newsroom to your inbox.\n",

        "content": "The techies and billionaires luxuriating in Palm Beach mansions and upscale nabes like Wellington in the western part of Palm Beach County can\u2019t get enough of that easy, breezy, state income tax-free Florida lifestyle. Now, they\u2019re moving their firms with them, gobbling up Class A office space in West Palm Beach.\nAt a mere 3.95 million square feet, West Palm Beach\u2019s Central Business District is 100 times smaller than Midtown Manhattan but, thanks to the demand, it\u2019s seeing big city rents over three-digits \u2014 and now another 1 million square feet is on its way.\n\u201cPeople are moving here and moving their companies here and absorbing space,\u201d said Brian Gale of Cushman & Wakefield who is leasing the new boutique office project at 300 Banyan Blvd. \u201cIt\u2019s not musical chairs. It\u2019s positive, new-to-the-market absorption.\u201d\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, without renewals, 267,535 square feet was leased in 2024, with Class A average asking rents at $105.31.\nThere was a vacancy of 19.1% as new towers were added to the market but is quickly being absorbed with deal activity increasing 90% year over year.\nAccording to Green Street data, all of Palm Beach County has an occupancy of 90%, which has pushed up office asking rents 63% over the last five years.\nSo who are these billionaire Palm Beach boosters behind the boom? You can blame most of it on Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. His local company, Related Ross, developed and just opened a complex on a former church parking lot at the end of the Royal Park Bridge to Palm Beach known as One Flagler, where two other billionaires, John Paulson and Ron Baron, have now leased offices.\nThis 285,000-square-foot project aka 180 Lakeview Ave. is 95% leased with other tenants including Diameter Capital Partners, the Chicago-based GTCR and Vipertec at rents exceeding $120 per foot.\nDesigned by David Childs of Skidmore Owings Merrill, the crown of this 25-story tower is lit with white LEDs. Its low-rise garage is covered in lush greenery and its top serves as a 19,000-square-foot amenity terrace. Already, the buzzy Greek restaurant, Milos West Palm Beach, is a hit in its base, while a new eight-piece reflective sculpture, Portals, by Fred Eversley, has become an icon in the adjacent park.\nAcross Lakeview Avenue to the north, the red and glass towers of 777 S. Flagler Dr. have been home to Morgan Stanley since they opened in 1985. Known as Phillips Point, these two towers have 449,000 square feet, parking for 1,174 cars and a Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse \u2014 nevertheless, Related Ross is also planning upgrades.\nRoss also updated the Esperante Corporate Center at 222 Lakeview and developed the new 360 Rosemary, which is just north of Ross\u2019 signature project at CityPlace.\n\u201cThis environment, the community and the types of amenities have resonated here more than in Miami,\u201d \u00a0said Jordan Rathlev, SVP of Ross\u2019s local company, Related Ross. \u201cWe own 95% of the Class A market and are not sellers.\u201d\nBut Ross and company didn\u2019t just transform Palm Beach overnight \u2014 this explosion was decades in the making.\nAbout 30 years ago, Related, Himmel & Co. and the O\u2019Connor Group won a city request for proposals (RFP) and began developing CityPlace into a 600,000-square-foot lifestyle center with offices, condos and rental apartments surrounding about 60 retailers and restaurants. Opening in 2000, it transformed and energized downtown West Palm Beach into a walkable, mixed-use and dynamic community with green spaces and programmed activities.\n\nTo its west is the Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts which opened in 1992, while to the south, across Okeechobee Boulevard., is the Palm Beach County Convention Center which opened in 2004 (it\u2019s where Pres. Trump gave his election night victory speech last fall). The adjacent Hilton Hotel was also developed by Related.\nRathlev says the key to Ross\u2019s success boils down to health care, education, attainable housing and mobility.\n\u201cIf you need to move a company you need to have a workforce,\u201d Rathlev said. \u201cWe need to have homegrown talent.\u201d\nThat why after being inspired by his experience on New York\u2019s Cornell Tech Council, Ross is bringing Nashville\u2019s Vanderbilt University to 7 acres in the western part of the city where it will build a $300 million graduate campus designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects focused on computing, engineering and innovation tech for 1,000 students.\nIt will be situated on the east side of the Amtrak station, while the west side will soon have a $500 million, 150-bed Cleveland Clinic hospital at 400-450 Australian Ave., also orchestrated by Ross.\nLast week, Related Ross broke ground at CityPlace on two towers with 1 million square feet of offices and retail on the site of the former FAO Schwarz toy store. A Macy\u2019s closed in 2016 and is now a luxury rental.\n\u201cSmaller format stores and more tenants with an experiential presence are more appealing than department stores,\u201d said Rathlev.\nThe upcoming 25-story 15 CityPlace was designed by Arquitectonica and will be topped with an\u00a0expansive sky garden designed by Gensler. This tower will be\u00a0anchored by 150,000 square feet of medical offices and outpatient facilities for the Cleveland Clinic, which already has a smaller spot in CityPlace.\nThe adjacent,\u00a022-story 10 CityPlace was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and will feature private outdoor terraces. Both buildings are set to open in 2027.\nJust to the north is Related Ross\u2019 first luxury apartment rental, the Laurel at 575 Rosemary, where\u00a0Equinox West Palm Beach will open in 35,000 square feet at the end of 2025.\n\u201cYou have major companies, money managers and all kinds of private offices. I get calls from all over the country looking for real estate here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no wonder that local real estate insiders call the town, \u201cRelatedville.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible and unprecedented in the country,\u201d said William Reichel of Reichel Realty & Investment about Ross\u2019 reshaping of Palm Beach. \u201cHe has invested $8 to $10 billion in West Palm and has his hands in getting us a nice university and the Cleveland Clinic. There are incredible dynamics going on.\u201d\nReichel recently marketed a $10 million development site at 605 S. Olive Ave. that had five offers and is now contracted to a local developer. A 10-story building of 51,150 square feet plus parking and mechanical space can be built with zoning for anything from a boutique office to a hotel and residential.\u201cYou have major companies, money managers and all kinds of private offices,\u201d Reichel said. \u201cI get calls from all over the country looking for real estate here.\u201d\nJLL is marketing a 72,000-square-foot boutique office at 205 Datura St. with expected pricing of $48 million \u2014 around $680 per foot. It has a 257-car garage and is 80% leased to tenants including\u00a0AltaRock Partners, Sound Point Capital Management and Stone Point Capital.\nThe seller, Morning Calm, paid $14 million after PNC left in 2019 and added $10.8 million in upgrades.\n\u201cThey love the building but it\u2019s time to move some capital and look for other opportunities,\u201d said Hermen Rodriguez of JLL who leads the marketing with\u00a0Ike Ojala and Matthew McCormack.\nA few blocks north, Gale of Cushman & Wakefield is leasing the new, dramatic office building at 300 Banyan, developed by Brand Atlantic and Wheelock Street Capital and designed by B+H Architects, that is hospitality-focused with many terraces and amenities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most gorgeous boutique office building both inside and out,\u201d said Gale. Asking rents are between $110 and $120 per foot. Alvarez & Marsal and the specialty telecom contractors, Dycom Industries, are among the tenants.\nIt\u2019s adjacent to the developer\u2019s update of the low rise 111 Olive St. which hosts small offices and, soon, the Mediterranean restaurant Kyma which has a location in Related\u2019s Hudson Yards in New York.\nThe Banyan & Olive project wraps onto historic Clematis Street which reverberates with dining and even dancing when it becomes a festive, pedestrian-only party that is particularly loved by those that can walk to their very affordable condos.\nFor those that party too heartily, NYU Langone has doctors\u2019 offices on Clematis and is building a new $75 million medical tower at the nearby 324 Datura St., better to serve both its Big Apple snowbirds and those that have nested here permanently.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable evolution of West Palm Beach,\u201d said Rodriquez.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Boca Raton, long a stronghold of gated communities, golf courses and retiree-friendly condos, is suddenly in the midst of a rental boom.\nHeavyweight developers known for luxury condo towers and high-end office buildings in places like Miami are homing in on the Palm Beach County city with big bets on higher-density living.\nAbout 7,600 apartment units are being planned or developed in Boca \u2014 which is more than\u00a0four times what\u2019s been delivered to the market between 2022 and now, according to data from Yardi Matrix.\nProposals for communities of hundreds of apartments \u2014 and, in one case, over 1,000 \u2014 are finding their way onto Boca business parks, next to the Tri-Rail Station,\u00a0on Office Depot\u2019s former corporate campus and even part of a master plan for Boca\u2019s new City Hall.\nInvestors are betting that the migration of people and business to Palm Beach County is still ongoing and that employees \u2014 some priced out of a housing market where values climbed 78% in the past five years, according to Miller Samuel and Douglass Elliman \u2014 will find appeal in rental communities with pools and yoga studios, an easy walk to retail and, perhaps, the office.\n\u201cWe want all these amazing companies to come here, but we also want to provide the necessary housing for those companies to be able to thrive,\u201d said David Martin, CEO of Terra, a Miami-based luxury condo developer that\u2019s now on tap to build Boca rentals in the future City Hall neighborhood.\u00a0\u201cWorkforce housing, or attainable housing, I think is a critical piece of the puzzle.\u201d\nMartin\u2019s firm, in partnership with Frisbie Group, won a four-way competition this year for the rights to redevelop Boca\u2019s government complex, with a 2.5 million-square-foot proposal that includes a 150-room hotel, 250,000 square feet of office space \u2014 and 1,129 rental units.\u00a0The plan, at 201 West Palmetto Park Road, bested three other pitches, including one from Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross\u2019s firm, Related Ross, which came in second with a plan that leaned more heavily on building office space.\nElsewhere in Boca, Miami developer 13th Floor Investments plans to build a 340-unit apartment complex next to the Tri-Rail Station, at Yamato Road. The eight-story development will include affordable and \u201cworkforce\u201d housing, available to tenants of varying incomes, according to published reports.\nAnd further north, a partnership that acquired Office Depot\u2019s corporate campus in 2023 has big residential visions there too. Miami\u2019s Related Group, BH Group, and PEBB Enterprises just got approval for 500 apartments on the 29-acre site, in addition to\u00a043,000 square feet of retail and a 37,000-square-foot\u00a0Equinox fitness center. To make way for those plans, the partnership will demolish 246,000 square feet of office space (more than half of what\u2019s there), while keeping two other corporate buildings. Office Depot remains as a tenant.\n\u201cWorkforce housing, or attainable housing, I think is a critical piece of the puzzle.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a real shortage and a real demand,\u201d said Isaac Toledano, co-head of BH Group. \u201cNot a lot of new rentals were built in Boca at the last nine years.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you see what\u2019s going on around you in West Palm Beach and in Palm Beach County,\u201d Toledano added, citing out-of-state firms setting up Florida outposts and young employees following, \u201cit makes sense that a place like Boca will grow.\u201d\nThe great COVID migration southward has sent demand for rentals upward. The number of renter-occupied units in Boca Raton has been rising since 2019, while owner-occupied units have been decreasing since then, according to US Census data compiled by PropertyShark. In 2023, the most recent data available, there were 14,107 renter-occupied units in Boca, or 18% more than in 2019.\nRents are holding steady though \u2014 a sign that development has thus far has met, but not exceeded, demand, said Ken Johnson,\u00a0a housing economist and the Christie Kirkland Walker chair of real estate at the University of Mississippi (who retired from Boca\u2019s Florida Atlantic University last year). In February, Palm Beach County rents climbed a modest 2.31% from a year earlier, Johnson said.\n\u201cWe need to keep building \u2014 that\u2019s\u2019 the caveat,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat we need right now to really settle the housing crisis in Palm beach County\u00a0is the right number of roofs to live under. And I don\u2019t think we have enough roofs yet.\u201d",

And now, they\u2019re looking to move on to the next chapter.\nIn the episode, they mention they own an electrical company. The years since have seen their business grow in Georgia and Tennessee, we hear \u2014 and they now wish to live in a location that\u2019s central to them all.\nMade up of 5,000-plus square feet, the residence they\u2019re now leaving behind is largely quite private, sharing only a few neighbors.\nDesigned by local architect J. Michael Hunnicutt, the three-story home reflects a modern aesthetic, bolstered by insulated concrete form construction, smooth stucco finishes and barreled rooflines.\nCarly Sostheim of Corcoran Reverie holds the listing.\nThe estate caters to a discerning buyer seeking both leisure and functionality, Sostheim told The Post.\nA 350-foot deep-water dock provides immediate Gulf access, complemented by an included 2021 Berretta pontoon, with proximity to fishing grounds and Shell Island.\nThe outdoor amenities extend to a saltwater pool and spa, framed by travertine tile and glass, alongside a fully appointed summer kitchen.\nInside, the home features high ceilings, expansive windows, and a meticulously crafted kitchen with custom walnut cabinets and Caesarstone quartz surfaces.\nSostheim emphasizes the listing\u2019s unique positioning,\u00a0stating its architecture is \u201clike no other.\u201d\n\u201cSituated with a highly desirable east-west orientation, this home provides 180-degree bay views from the rear elevation and 180-degree island views from the front elevation.\u201d\nThe layout ensures that every bedroom captures serene water views, while covered patios on each level \u2014 secured with tempered glass railings \u2014 offer unobstructed vistas, including a terrace off a barrel-ceilinged office.\nApart from its on-screen history, it\u2019s the home\u2019s many features that also let it stand out.\n\u201cThis home captures all that is alluring of the Florida lifestyle,\u201d Sostheim notes.\nAdvertisement",

And though they often trade with condos (like parking spaces or storage), they\u2019re actually separate pieces of real estate with their own pint-sized deeds.\nThat also means owners must pay maintenance fees and taxes on their poolside escapes. And if their finances are sinking, they might decided to jettison their splash pads for a little floating capital. There are other senecios, too.\n\u201cIf you sell your property and the buyer doesn\u2019t want your cabana, you must sell that cabana right away,\u201d said Fern\u00a0Fodiman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nLooking to (Marco) make a splash yourself (Polo)? Go ahead, cannonball: These are the priciest cabanas in PB.\nThere are just six privately owned cabanas at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Palm Beach Gardens, a small city on South Florida\u2019s mainland, each worth a cool $1 million.\nEvery cabana has a living area, a kitchenette and a bathroom, offering a gentle reprieve from the sun, said John Greene of Douglas Elliman. He represents unit 301-302 in the development at 2200 PGA Blvd., which is slated for completion next year. Priced at $15.5 million, the condo listing includes not only the cabana, but a boat slip.\n\u201cIt gives you a sense of what you get for a million dollars in this market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a private cabana.\u201d\nThe east-facing poolside cubbies, which span up to 383 square feet, sit in the lap of luxury, looking across to the project\u2019s private marina in the North Palm Beach Waterway.\nResidents heading right to the gym or a restaurant can pop in for a quick change without going to their apartments, Greene added.\nThe 93 cabanas at Sloans Curve, at 2000 and 2001 South Ocean Blvd. on Palm Beach, are each worth about $500,000, partially due to the condo\u2019s proximity to the homes of Tommy Hilfiger and other celebrities, said Frisbie.\nFrisbie represents unit 504N in 2000 South Ocean, which is priced at $7.99 million and includes a cabana. Along with a kitchenette and a full bath, it has pretty vegetation outside and privacy from the rest of the row.\nAnd while a half-million-dollar valuation may seem absurd to some, thanks to the arch of the building, \u201cThe cabanas are nestled down in the dune and protected from the prevailing breeze,\u201d she said. Plus, \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a tiny market, as soon as one person pays it, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nOver on Palm Beach island, the Breakers at 2 N Breakers Row has 40 cabanas, each tucked discretely behind a sliding glass door.\nMeasuring 175 square feet, they offer seclusion in the pool area, which is shared by residents and their guests (leading to nasty looks in the competition for chairs on busy days).\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s 75 degrees, you just open the door and you have this amazing cross breeze,\u201d said Jack Elkins of William Raveis South Florida.\nHis listing, the 3,560-square-foot No. PH4, is priced at $17.5 million and has a cabana.\nProviding the ultimate convenience, snacks can be ordered right to it, Elkins said, but the proximity to the ocean makes it worth at least $500,000.\nFodiman sold unit 308N at 2100 South Ocean Blvd. for $8.95 million in April 2023. Nicely updated and in a desirable location along the pool, the cabana attached that sale was also worth about $500,000, she said.\nBut even at that price point, demand is driving up prices up, up and away, said Fodiman, noting that most condos have lengthy waiting lists of hopeful buyers vying for cabanas. And while those in sunny spots were once more desirable: \u201cNow people want them on the ocean side where they\u2019re not in the sun,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the ocean side, you\u2019re literally watching the waves come in. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

They can experience all of the perks of Manhattan, but then you\u2019re able to come back to a quieter, less hectic, cool, community-oriented neighborhood. It\u2019s what buyers are looking for now more than ever,\u201d she said.\nOverall, property inventory across the five boroughs fell 3.5% year-over-year, to 14,840 units for sale citywide as of January, according to StreetEasy, which noted heightened buyer competition particularly in Brooklyn.\n\u201cRight now, when a two-bedroom in Park Slope goes on the market, if it\u2019s priced correctly \u2013 automatic bidding war,\u201d Kelly said with a snap of her fingers.\n\u201cWhen you have a lack of inventory and a demand for inventory, it drives prices up. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with those increases in the outer boroughs,\u201d she said.\nAnd people are fed up with dishing out absurd amounts in monthly rent, Kelly noted.\nIn February, the average Manhattan rental price was $5,368 per month \u2013 nearly four times the national average,according to RentalRealEstate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really tough for people to rent in the city right now, and if they have the means to buy, they\u2019re coming to the conclusion that it is probably in their best interest to do so,\u201d Kelly said.\nAdvertisement",

The median age of repeat homebuyers is now 61, jumping 25 years since 1981, according to analysis from the\u00a0National Association of Realtors\u00ae.\nBut as the demographic of buyers has changed, so too have their tastes.\n\u201cAs we begin to age, we start looking at things from a different perspective\u2014a wiser set of eyes,\u201d says\u00a0Paul Dashevsky, co-founder ofGreatBuildz.\nThat added wisdom means prioritizing practicality overkeeping up with the Joneses. Retirees want more than a white picket fence: They want to maximize their\u00a0equity\u00a0by investing in a low-maintenance property in a great community that will allow them to age in place.\nWe spoke with builders, real estate agents, and senior care specialists to learn what retirees are looking for in their next home. Here\u2019s what we found:\nBaby boomers own\u00a0$84 trillion worth of real estate wealth, and they want to make the most of it in retirement. One of the chief ways they can do so is todownsize\u00a0their home, says\u00a0Karen Holt, global real estate advisor at Premier Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\u201cMany retirees are downsizing from larger family homes to single-story or low-maintenance properties,\u201d she adds.\nNot only are these properties better suited to the changing accessibility needs of older adults, but they\u2019re often cheaper to buy and maintain.\nThose savings allow retirees to make the most of their home sale proceeds and create a financial cushion to fund retirement expenses, travel, healthcare, or hobbies.\n\u201cAging-in-place improvements are crucial for many retirees,\u201d adds Holt. These home modifications use\u00a0universal design\u00a0elements to enhance the safety, accessibility, and comfort of a space.\nBut\u00a0adaptive living\u00a0is more than just a matter of practicality\u2014it\u2019s also a top design trend for 2025, according toForbes.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nHomeowners of all ages are increasingly incorporating discrete adaptations such as curbless showers, smart lighting systems, and sleek grab bars that complement the home\u2019s aesthetics.\nAs more homeowners\u00a0move less\u00a0and stay in their homes longer, design experts predict these modifications will soon become standard practice, blending safety with contemporary style.\nBy retirement, most homeowners have had enough of maintaining a property: They want to relax and enjoy the fruits of their labor. Likewise, they may not have the same disposable income they once did and opt to not spend on housekeeping services, perAARP\u2019s recommendation.\nAs such, they\u2019re drawn to durable materials that require little upkeep, and energy-efficient appliances that keep overhead costs down, says Holt.\nBut don\u2019t mistake low-maintenance with flashy tech, advises\u00a0Brandon Blakeley, co-founder and chief technology officer ofMirador Living, a platform that connects seniors with senior care.\n\u201cWhereas younger buyers might be impressed by flashy superficials like new granite countertops, TOTO toilets, or exotic hardwood floors, retirees who are looking for a new home tend to be much more focused on the \u2018peace of mind\u2019 fundamentals of a home,\u201d he says.\nThese include\u00a0Energy Star-rated appliances\u00a0that reduce utility bills and environmental impact, stain-resistant carpeting that requires little maintenance and reduces fall risk, and non-porous countertops that are easy to clean.\nRetirees want ways to enrich their freetime, not waste it. As such, they prioritize communities with proximity to recreational activities, family, and services.\n\u201cNeighborhoods with community centers offering recreational options like pickleball courts, swimming pools, and art classes are highly attractive,\u201d says Holt. \u201cSidewalks for walking and nearby places of worship further enhance the sense of community and accessibility, providing retirees with a well-rounded, engaging lifestyle.\u201d\nThese amenities offer more than just leisure activities. They foster social connections and an active lifestyle, both essential for retirees\u2019 physical and mental well-being. Communities designed with convenience in mind can significantly improve retirees\u2019 quality of life by promoting independence and social engagement, critical factors forhappiness in retirement.\nThe path to your\u00a0ideal retirement home\u00a0begins with careful consideration of your personal needs, finances, and lifestyle goals.\nStart by assessing your budget and clearly defining your priorities\u2014such as location, accessibility, or community features. While it\u2019s ideal to have all of these elements, you may have to sacrifice one for another, so creating a hierarchy of your wants can also be helpful.\nPartner with an\u00a0experienced real estate agent\u00a0who understands your situation and can streamline your search by finding homes that fit your criteria. Talk with your agent about a financing plan to make sure that you\u2019re able to maximize your equity without sacrificing your desires.\nOnce you\u2019ve aligned your vision with practical considerations, you\u2019ll be ready to move into your new chapter.\nWith an older demographic of homebuyers driving the market, it\u2019s worth marketing to this demographic if you\u2019re\u00a0selling your home\u00a0in the years ahead. But doing so will require careful consideration: \u201cThe key lies in emphasizing real benefits,\u201d says\u00a0Orlando Penner, owner and operator ofSouth County Sheds.\nThis approach resonates with retirees who value comfort and convenience more than extravagant features or superficial upgrades.\nHolt agrees with his assessment and suggests taking this practicality one step further by emphasizing location-based conveniences.\n\u201cSellers should also emphasize the proximity of their property to healthcare services, grocery stores, recreational facilities, and community centers. Highlighting local amenities like walking trails, places of worship, and social clubs can make the property even more enticing,\u201d she says.\nAfter all, retirement isn\u2019t just about the home itself; it\u2019s about the lifestyle it supports. By marketing properties as gateways to a vibrant, connected community, sellers can tap into retirees\u2019 desire for an active, fulfilling life in their golden years.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "When\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u00a0moved\u00a0back into the White House\u00a0on Jan. 20, it triggered a somewhat surprising migration trend among some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, who promptly packed their bags and relocated abroad, withmany citing their upset over his electionwin as the reason for their sudden desire to live elsewhere.\nSince Trump claimed victory over\u00a0Democratic candidate\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0in the\u00a02024 presidential election,\u00a0multiple A-listers have quit the U.S.\u00a0and moved elsewhere.\nSome, like\u00a0Eva Longoria\u00a0and\u00a0Rosie O\u2019Donnell, have publicly decried Trump\u2019s administration and made clear that it was his policies that pushed them to find a new home outside of the U.S.\nOthers, including\u00a0Ellen DeGeneres\u00a0and\u00a0Richard Gere, have been slower to link their relocations with his administration, despite being outspoken critics of Trump in the past.\nHowever, all of these stars have been quick to gush about their new home countries, with many opting to base themselves in Europe, where they have found new, luxurious dwellings that afford them the same lavish comforts as their mansions in Los Angeles or New York.\nOf course, there may well be more A-list emigrations to come, given the huge number of stars who have threatened to leave the country should Trump return to the White House\u2014including\u00a0Sharon Stone\u00a0and\u00a0Cher; however, it\u2019s understood that they are still residing primarily in the U.S.\nLess than two weeks after the presidential election took place, Texas-born actress Longoria revealed that\u00a0she had turned her back on the U.S., explaining in an interview withMarie Clairethat she was \u201cdone\u201d withlife in \u201cdystopian\u201d America.\nThe former \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star told the outlet that she and her husband,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n, had \u201cescaped\u201d the country with their son,\u00a0Santiago, 6, and were living full time between their homes in Central America and Europe.\nAlthough\u00a0the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star\u00a0says she made the decision before Trump\u2019s election win, she said she believes the country will become a \u201cscary place\u201d if the President \u201ckeeps his promises.\u201d\nLongoria conceded that she is very \u201cprivileged\u201d in her ability to move away from the country where she was born and raised\u2014and where she launched her successful acting career.\n\u201cI\u2019m privileged. I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren\u2019t so lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and my sadness is for them.\u201d\nThe actress noted that the conditions in her former home state of California were largely to blame for her decision to leave the U.S. before the election, insisting that while she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cs\u2013t\u201d on the region, she found certain aspects of it very difficult to bear.\n\u201cI had my whole adult life here. But even before [the COVID-19 pandemic], it was changing, the vibe was different. And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge,\u201d she went on. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s\u2013t on California\u2014it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.\u201d\nLongoria\u2019s official exodus from the U.S. appears to have begun in earnest in 2023, when she put her sprawling Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $22.88 million\u2014later slashing the price to $18.98 million in May 2024.\nThe listing for the home was removed in August of that same year; however, that didn\u2019t stop Longoria and her family from leaving the dwelling behind in favor of residing between her homes in Mexico and Madrid.\nAmong the first to have fled the U.S. were\u00a0DeGeneres and her wife,\u00a0Portia de Rossi, whoswapped their mansion in Montecito, CA,for an $18 million farmhouse in the British countryside, where they are understood to have been living since the end of 2024.\nWhen news of their move was made public just weeks after the election in November 2024, TMZ reported that, while the couple had purchased their U.K. home in June, months before Trump\u2019s win, their decision to \u201cget the hell out\u201d of America was cemented by his victory.\nDeGeneres was an outspoken supporter ofHarrisduring the 2024 presidential election, publicly endorsing her in a post shared on Instagram back in August.\nSoon after, it was revealed that the couple had purchased a historic farmhouse in the Cotswolds, a celebrity-loved locale that is about two hours outside of London.\nAnd if there had been any doubt about their desire to make the U.K. their permanent residence, DeGeneres and de Rossi\u2014who have made a lucrative career out of real estate investment\u2014quickly began selling off their last remaining homes in the U.S., one of which was recently sold for $5.2 million, while another remains on the market for $29.99 million.\nStill, their move has not been without its difficulties.\nAccording to one report from London-based newspaper theDaily Mail, DeGeneres quickly found herself \u201cin peril of getting on the wrong side\u201d of a high-profile member of her new neighborhood after she \u201ccommitted a \u2018technical breach'\u201d during the build of a single-story extension at her new abode in what the outlet described as a \u201cplanning clash.\u201d\nDeGeneres and de Rossi are reported to have received several objections from their neighbors, who have spoken out against their extension plan.\nDespite the protests, a spokesperson for West Oxfordshire Direct Council insisted that the Roman remains sit over 200 yards from DeGeneres and de Rossi\u2019s property and that the work was \u201ccompleted to a high standard.\u201d\nHollywood legend and outspoken Trump critic Gere made his plans tomove away from the U.S.months before the election, telling Vanity Fair Spain in April 2024 that he and his wife,\u00a0Alejandra, were relocating to her home country of Spain so that she could be closer to her family.\n\u201cIt is a beautiful place, the food is extraordinary and the people exude sensitivity and generosity, as well as a strong will to laugh and enjoy,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to going there.\n\u201cFor Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends and her culture. She was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers.\n\u201cI love Spain and the ability of the Spanish people to live transmitting joy and happiness.\u201d\nSoon after, the \u201cPretty Woman\u201d star sold his Connecticut mansion for $10.75 million in an off-market deal, just two years after purchasing the expansive pad from crooner\u00a0Paul Simon\u00a0and his wife,\u00a0Edie Brickell.\nGere and his spouse eventually relocated to their new home in Madrid with their children,\u00a0Albert, 11,\u00a0Alexander, 5, and\u00a0James, 4, shortly before Christmas, later tellingElle Espa\u00f1athat they were \u201chappier than ever\u201d with their new lives in the European country.\n\u201cThe truth is that you are seeing us in our momentum. We are happier than ever,\u201d he said during an interview with the outlet. \u201c[Alejandra is happy] because she is at home and I [am happy] because, if she is happy, I am happy.\u201d\nWhile the actor did not point to politics as the reason for his move, hedidbrand the U.S. a \u201cdark place\u201d while accepting an award from fellow Hollywood star\u00a0Antonio Banderas\u00a0in February, before going on to slam\u00a0President Trump as a \u201cbully and a thug.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all part of a universe of overlapping pain and sadness and joy. \u2026 I see this world that we\u2019re in now forgetting that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis very foolish tribalism is starting to take us over, where we think that we\u2019re all separate from each other.\n\u201cAnd we have unfortunately elected officials that don\u2019t inspire us in the way that we want to be inspired. I\u2019m coming from a place now \u2026 we\u2019re in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who is the president of the United States.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just in the U.S., it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\nKurt Cobain\u2019s widow\u00a0announced her decision to permanently ditch her home country\u00a0in favor ofrelocating to the U.K.during an appearance in London this month, telling spectators at a talk at the Royal Geographical Society that she is planning to apply for British citizenship, while branding President Trump\u2019s plans for the U.S. \u201cfrightening.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to live here,\u201d she said of her move to the U.K., according to theDaily Mail. \u201cI\u2019m finally getting my British citizenship in six months. I get to be a citizen. I\u2019m applying, man! Can\u2019t get rid of me!\u201d\nThe singer, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, 78, for years, initially moved to the U.K. from her home in Los Angeles back in 2019\u2014but says she now plans to make London her permanent home.\nThe singer-songwriter previously gushed about her love of the British city, telling theEvening Standardin 2017, \u201cI know I\u2019m going to end up there. I know what neighborhood I\u2019m going to end up in, and I know that I want to be on the Thames.\n\u201cI subscribe to this magazine called\u00a0Country Life, which is just real-estate porn and fox hunting. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nLove rose to stardom as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Hole, which she formed in 1989.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "It\u2019s finally time to say goodbye to the old Northern Avenue bridge.The 640-foot span over the Fort Point Channel opened more than a century ago, a compressed air-powered swing bridge that swiveled out of the way for ships that trawled the waterway in what was then a hotbed of industry.The people who worked Fort Point\u2019s wharves and warehouses at the start of the 20th century would not recognize the Seaport of today: a glitzy expanse of multimillion-dollar condos, swanky glass offices, and pricey restaurants. The blue-collar work has been shunted to one side of the peninsula, corralled in an army base-turned-industrial park. Through all the transformation, the Northern Avenue bridge endured \u2014 though not for much longer. The bridge has been rotting away, as things do without proper care and attention. First, the bridge was closed for cars in 1997. Then, it was fenced off for bikes and pedestrians, in 2014.Through various administrations \u2014 mayors Menino, Walsh, now Wu \u2014 city officials wrestled with the best way to reinvigorate or replace it. Now, this important vestige of the waterfront\u2019s industrial past is heading for the scrap heap.AdvertisementA view of the Northern Avenue Bridge in Boston on Dec. 3, 1985.Joe DennehyLast year, Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration received an updated assessment of the bridge\u2019s structural integrity, and the picture wasn\u2019t pretty. City officials decided to remove the superstructure, as it\u2019s called, to protect the safety of the Fort Point Channel waterway, and they have no immediate plans to replace it.So the city\u2019s Public Works Department is advancing plans to break it apart, and load the pieces onto barges to a waterfront staging area behind the Leader Bank Pavilion, for disassembly and paint removal. The concrete masonry piers that hold up the bridge would stay. The holes in the iron girders that support the bridge are getting so big, the Massachusetts Historical Commission has signaled it\u2019s fine with the demolition plans; better to take it apart now before pieces fall into the channel.In December, the commission\u2019s lead historic preservation officer asked city officials to update the paperwork, to reflect the fact that a fancy replacement that was envisioned in 2020 under then-mayor Marty Walsh is on hold. The city has budgeted $31 million so far for dealing with the bridge, including $9 million that\u2019s already been spent on design and engineering work. The Wu administration hopes to start demolition later this year, pending the necessary permit approvals from the US Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies, and says it could cost at least $20 million.AdvertisementAbout that fancy replacement: The public debate that led to its design reflected the broader tug of war in Boston between prioritizing cyclists and pedestrians, and ensuring car traffic flows unimpeded. The end result was an attempt to balance the two: the new bridge would be reinforced enough to support cars and trucks, but limited to emergency vehicles and buses that serve the Seaport. (Many of the Seaport shuttles to North Station have since been replaced by ferry service.) The price tag kept climbing, to $100 million or more. Now, those plans are getting shelved.However, the idea of building a new span across the mouth of the Fort Point Channel lives on.First, the Northern Avenue Bridge was closed for cars in 1997. Then, it was fenced off for bikes and pedestrians, in 2014.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffEnter John Sullivan, the chief engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. He\u2019s been floating an idea for more than three years to build a barrier with movable gates at the channel\u2019s entrance, to keep storm surges out, and to hold rainwater in. It\u2019s by far the most expensive element of a much broader effort by Boston Water and Sewer to address pain points throughout the city\u2019s stormwater system.At first glance, this Fort Point concept might seem a little crazy. But Sullivan, a practical guy, makes a persuasive case. Fort Point Channel is a nexus for a wide range of storm pipes that snake out to downtown, South Boston, the South End. If a heavy rain hits with a storm surge at high tide, that whole network might be overrun. Sullivan\u2019s concept would only close the floodgates at low tide if severe weather is in the forecast; the gates would then create a giant bathtub that could hold up to 160 million gallons of water as the tide rises. The water can then be released or pumped out, as the tide recedes, to avoid flooding of the properties near the channel and to protect hundreds of acres from watery devastation.AdvertisementSullivan said his team had a three-hour conversation last month with the Army Corps, which is in the midst of a thorough review of the Boston coastline\u2019s resiliency, and the federal agency seems to be warming up to this concept. If it moves forward, he said, the agency might end up paying for as much as two-thirds of the cost. That\u2019s important, especially when you size up the potential price tag: up to $767 million for submerged gates that would stay on the ocean floor and only be raised to shut the channel during bad storms. The project is not as far-fetched as it might seem: A similar barrier was installed in the 1960s at the mouth of the Providence River, protecting Rhode Island\u2019s capital city.This new Fort Point Channel barrier also would provide a logical foundation for a new footbridge, either to the north of what\u2019s left of the Northern Avenue bridge, or roughly in its existing footprint. The schematics on file at Boston Water and Sewer assume a harbor walk would be part of any dam design. (Fortifying the structure to accommodate cars can be done, but it would drive up the costs.)AdvertisementThe Northern Avenue Bridge, an important vestige of the waterfront\u2019s industrial past, is heading for the scrap heap.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffSullivan knows federal money is tight right now. Not to worry. Permitting a project of this scope could take up to five years. He doesn\u2019t expect construction to begin until the 2030s. The original conclusion in City Hall a few years ago was that the floodgates couldn\u2019t be worked into the official Northern Avenue bridge replacement project. Now that city officials are receptive to other scenarios, Sullivan said, he is hopeful about gaining traction with this combo project: a bridge above, and floodgates below.Restoring pedestrian and bike access across the channel would be welcomed by employers in the area, said Patrick Sullivan, head of the Seaport Transportation Management Association. While his group supported the compromise concept from five years ago that\u2019s now in limbo, he says some members are relieved that city officials are moving ahead with the demolition for safety reasons.The old bridge turned out to be just the right infrastructure for the Fort Point Channel at the dawn of the 20th century, to keep industry there humming along. With climate change posing an ever-increasing threat to low-lying coastal cities like Boston, these floodgates might end up as just the right project to protect the channel and its commerce for the rest of the 21st century, and beyond.City officials decided to remove the Northern Avenue Bridge to protect the safety of the Fort Point Channel waterway, and they have no immediate plans to replace it.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

        "content": "In the first major deal at MIT\u2019s ambitious overhaul of the old Volpe Center in Kendall Square, Cambridge drugmaker Biogen said Monday it will move its headquarters into a 580,000-square-foot lab and office building that will launch construction soon and open in 2028.Biogen\u2019s move comes amid a period of broad turbulence in the biotechnology industry, one that has slowed the once-voracious appetite for life-science real estate in Cambridge. It will also coincide with the 50th anniversary of the company\u2019s founding and is a sign that one of Massachusetts\u2019 biggest homegrown biotechs remains committed to the region, state officials said.\u201cBiogen has been a foundational presence in the Massachusetts life science ecosystem for close to half a century,\u201d said Governor Maura Healey, in a statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to see them begin a new era in our state.\u201dAdvertisementProbably best known for its multiple sclerosis drugs, Biogen has 1,654 employees in Massachusetts and about 7,500 employees worldwide, according to spokesperson Dan Haro. But the company has slimmed down considerably in recent years. A MassBio report in 2020 gave Biogen a Massachusetts headcount of 2,400.The 1960's-era Volpe building in Kendall Square is being demolished and its large site being redeveloped by MIT. Biogen said Monday it will move its headquarters into a new building there, to open in 2028.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffIts office space here will slim down too, at least in terms of square footage. Biogen currently owns or leases 992,000 square feet in three buildings in Kendall, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning the company is trimming about 412,000 square feet from its local footprint.But the short move from Binney Street to Broadway is significant in other ways. Biogen will consolidate teams into a single building, the first private development to go up at the Volpe site, which was long a federal transportation research facility and will be rebranded Kendall Common. Work on Biogen\u2019s building, which will be jointly developed by MIT Investment Management Co. and BioMed Realty, will begin on Monday, MIT said. MIT declined to specify a development cost.\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that Biogen \u2014 a company with such close ties to people at MIT \u2014 will make Kendall Common\u2019s first building its new home,\u201d said MIT President Sally Kornbluth in a statement. \u201cThe motto of Kendall Square might as well be \u2018talent in proximity\u2019 and Biogen\u2019s decision to intensify its presence here promises great things for the whole ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisementMIT in 2017 beat out several other major developers and paid $750 million to acquire the 14-acre site of the Volpe Transportation Systems Center, in the heart of Kendall Square between Broadway and Binney Street. The university now has city-approved plans for an eight-building, 3 million-square-foot commercial and residential project there, but could not start work until it built a new Volpe Building for the US Department of Transportation. That $530 million Volpe facility opened less than two years ago. (Earlier this month it appeared on the General Services Administration\u2019s list of properties deemed not essential to government operations and thus possibly up for sale, though that list was later taken down.)Biogen will move out of its headquarters on Binney Street in Cambridge, as well as two other buildings nearby, and consolidate into a single newly-constructed building on Broadway in Kendall Square.Vanessa Leroy/BloombergThe Biogen building at 75 Broadway would be the first of those eight projects, and the drugmaker would be its sole corporate tenant.The headquarters move marks another significant initiative by Christopher Viehbacher, who became chief executive in November 2022.\u201cNearly 50 years after first putting down roots in Kendall Square, Biogen is embarking on a new chapter in the very heart of the community that has shaped our success,\u201d Viehbacher said in a statement. \u201cOur new space will support the advancement of our pipeline of breakthrough medicines by bringing our employees together and fostering collaboration with leading scientific minds, key partners, and top talent.\u201dSince his arrival, Biogen has bought rare disease drugmaker Reata for about $7 billion, scrapped its controversial Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm, and cut roughly 11 percent of its global workforce as part of a program called \u201cFit for Growth.\u201dAdvertisementBiogen has also won full approval with its Japanese business partner Eisai of another closely watched Alzheimer\u2019s drug called Leqembi. That drug requires intravenous infusions every other week and is only one of two medications proven to at least modestly slow the advance of Alzheimer\u2019s in patients with early symptoms.Although multiple sclerosis drugs such as Tecfidera, Vumerity, Avonex, and Tysabri account for most of Biogen\u2019s income, revenue has fallen as cheaper generics became available.Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird, said consolidating Biogen\u2019s employees at one site made sense given that the company has shed hundreds of workers in Massachusetts in recent years.\u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of efforts to cut costs, and downsizing property-wise is consistent with that,\u201d he said.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

The five-floor red-brick home sits one block east of Fifth Avenue, spans 25 feet and includes six bedrooms, according to the listing. In addition to a celebrity past, the residence boasts rare luxuries, like a bi-level private garden, a wine cellar and marble clad fireplaces.\nNoble Black, who holds the listing alongside fellow Douglas Elliman agent Jennifer Kaufman Stillman, told The Post that the current owners managed to conserve the home\u2019s West Village charm despite a gut renovation.\n\u201cThe architecture of the space is so beautifully maintained,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think is very special.

Its spa-like en-suite bathroom includes a fireplace, a free-standing tub, custom marble and oak vanities, and access to one of two private garden-view terraces.\nParker and her actor husband Matthew Broderick bought the property for $18.99 million in 2011 and sold it in2015, although they spent three of those years trying to sell. The famous power couple first listed the townhouse for $25 million in 2012, and dropped the price several times until parting with it at a loss in 2015 for $18.25 million.\nDespite undertaking a full renovation at the East 10th Street residence, Parker and Broderick reportedly never lived there. Instead \u2014 in true Carrie fashion \u2014 they used the home as a giant closet,6sqft reported.\nThe current sellers, identified as Scott Sullivan and Anna Marrs,purchased the home in 2020for $15.85 million. They werepreviously featured in the Guardianfor filling their North London backyard with giant ferns, but it appears they didn\u2019t bring the same enthusiasm to their West Village environs.\nListing photos show a partially paved backyard with well-manicured shrubs and a light tree canopy.\nWhile SJP\u2019s former pad is certainly nice to look at, it\u2019s not getting nearly as much attention as the West Village home of her \u201cSex and the City\u201d character, Carrie Bradshaw.\nThe real-life owner of the brownstonemade headlines last weekwhen he was caught on camera confronting selfie-taking tourists, shouting \u201cIt\u2019s not Carrie\u2019s, it\u2019s mine!\u201d\nThe owner is currently petitioning the city\u2019s Landmark Preservation Committee for a steel and cast-iron gate to deter unwanted visitors, who have flocked there for photos for years.\nAdvertisement",

The first phase includes 502 underground parking spaces and 28,500 square feet of retail and community space, along with 1.9 acres of public open space.While the Longwood Medical Area is an academic and research powerhouse, employing nearly 73,000 people and drawing in more than 24,000 students, the neighborhood\u2019s amenities don\u2019t match its institutional prestige, Skanska and Simmons said in their city filing.\u201cThe sidewalks are narrow, food and beverage options are limited, and while the LMA is bordered in part by the Emerald Necklace, the majority of open space found within the LMA is located inside the fenced in campuses of private institutions,\u201d the filing states. \u201cThere is a notable absence of publicly accessible open space within the LMA, and the project endeavors to create a new community commons and neighborhood public gathering space that will provide a range of publicly accessible amenities that will seek to activate the corridor from morning until night.\u201dSome of those planned open spaces include a 31,000-square-foot open space along Brookline Avenue called the \u201cMain Heart\u201d and a central connector between the two commercial buildings including water features, public art, and range of seating.AdvertisementThe site currently holds 13 Simmons buildings that are \u201cgenerally in fair to poor condition,\u201d the Planning Department filing states, including dormitories, dining and athletic facilities, and two surface parking lots.

        "content": "By Talia Lissauer, The Boston Globe\n\n\nThe sole surviving residence fully designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany is up for sale in Back Bay for $11.5 million, alisting for the propertysaid.\n\nThe nearly 15,000 square foot mansion at 395 Commonwealth Ave. was designated a national historic landmark in 2005 and was originally commissioned by textile magnate Frederick Ayer and his wife. They lived there until Ayer died in 1918 and the property was used for a variety of purposes throughout the 1900s.\n\nAyer, alongside his brother, owned the Tremont and Suffolk Mills and the American Woolen Company, which owned 60 mills in New England,according to the Lowell Cemetery, where he is buried. He made the majority of his fortune while living in Lowell before moving to Boston. His home in Lowell became an orphanage and then the Franco-American School which operated until 2016.\n\n\nCompleted in 1902, the Ayer Mansion is the last standing home featuring handiwork both inside and out by famed designer Tiffany, the listing said. Tiffany, the son of Charles Lewis Tiffany, the founder of Tiffany & Co., made a name for himself as an artist and designer with his work with stained glass.\n\nTiffany grew up in New York City,but his art took him to North America, Europe and North Africa,according to Tiffany & Co. He started out as a painter but quickly discovered his love for stained glass and glass mosaics, and his work would end up in building lobbies, banks, hospitals, department stores and hotels.\n\nHis work was often inspired by the nature around him \u2014 dragonflies, grapevine and flowers \u2014 and he mixed metals, enamels and colored gemstones to create his pieces. In 1902, he was appointed Tiffany & Co.\u2019s art director, where he established the Tiffany Art Jewelry department for the Fifth Avenue store, and, two years later, his jewelry debuted at the St. Louis Exposition.\n\nNow known as the Ayer Mansion, the now single-family home has 23 bedrooms and 12 baths throughout its five stories, and also features rooftop panoramic views of Back Bay and the Boston skyline. There are five fireplaces throughout the townhouse and it has four parking spaces.\n\n\nThe unique design is seen in its granite facade with mosaic panels, arched ceilings, and its hand-laid Tiffany tiles and stained glass throughout the entire home.\n\n\u201cTiffany combined exotic architectural style with masterful design elements to create a museum-quality masterpiece that is just as unique now as it was at its unveiling at the turn of the 20th century,\u201d the listing said.\n\nWhile its landmark designation can make renovations difficult, it has undergone restoration renovations and is already \u201cwidely regarded as one of the most stunning and distinctive addresses on Commonwealth Avenue in Back Bay,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nLocated in the heart of Back Bay, it\u2019s a short walk to Newbury Street, Harvard Bridge and Fenway.\n\n\nAfter Ayer died and the estate was sold, the home transitioned to office space, a medical clinic, and the headquarters of an insurance company. In 1964, the Trimount Foundation, Inc., formally known as the Association of Cultural Interchange, Inc., turned it into a female students\u2019 dormitory until December 2021, when it was purchased by 395-399 Commonwealth Avenue LLC in an off-the-market sale.\n\nIt was listedback in May of 2022 for $17 millionand was reduced to $14,995,000 after a price drop in November of that year as they continued to seek a private buyer for the home. The listing was removed in April 2024 and returned as the current listing Feb. 24.\n\nThe Ayer Mansion is listed by Tracy Campion ofCampion & Company Fine Homes Real Estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBe civil.

Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland also had some of the biggest year-over-year declines in active listings, pointing to a growing rift between buyer demand and seller supply.\nThese cities\u2019 turbo-charged housing markets are in stark contrast with the country at large, which saw a scant 3.2% growth in median home prices over the same time period.\nThe country\u2019s broader housing market appears to be cooling somewhat. Homes are selling at the slowest pace in five years, Redfin reported. Pending sales saw their biggest decline since 2023 and active listings rose to their highest level since the early days of the pandemic.\n\u201cSome homes are attracting bidding wars like it\u2019s 2020 again, while others are sitting on the market for weeks with no action,\u201d Desiree Bourgeois, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Detroit, says in the report.\nIn stark contract to the Midwest cohort, home prices in Austin, Tampa and San Antonio fell the most \u2014 particularly in Austin, where a home-building boom is beginning to pay off. In Tampa, the picture is less rosy. Sky-high housing costs and untenable insurance rates have led to a pile-up of housing stock.\nUnfortunately for Milwaukeeans, there\u2019s little relief in renting.\nEarly 2025 data revealed that these same Midwestern cities are alsoamong the country\u2019s most competitive rental marketsright now. And while the Midwest remains relatively affordable \u2014 Detroit claims the lowest median sale price of any major metro \u2014 housing inventory is just not keeping up.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Living in the Hamptons is far from cheap \u2014 and now, in Montauk, a glam 1,200-square-foot trailer has listed for $1.19 million.\nOffering a front-row seat to the Atlantic Ocean and a glimpse into the evolving landscape of one of the Hamptons\u2019 most surprisingly exclusive enclaves, this residence \u2014 whose exterior marketing images show a tidy-looking mobile home \u2014 is the only four-bedroom unit in the Montauk Shores community.\nIt may seem to be a no-frills trailer park, but make no mistake \u2014 Montauk Shores has become home to a roster of ultra-wealthy homeowners, if not billionaires.\nBuilt in 1986, this residence, which has 1.5 bathrooms, has marble countertops, a spacious deck and an outdoor shower.\n\u201cIt sits there all by itself \u2026 This\u00a0home is very, very private,\u201d Susan Ceslow of Douglas Elliman who holds the listing, told The Post.\nCeslow sold this very unit to the current owners, a family, back in 2016 for $460,000.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just kind of now looking for something bigger,\u201d she said.\nWhile it\u2019s a steal compared to the Hamptons\u2019 multimillion-dollar estates, the listing underscores a seismic shift in this trailer park, where prices have soared over the past decade \u2014 turning a once-humble retreat into a warm-weather playground for the wealthy.\n\u201cEverybody just loves being there in the park,\u201d Ceslow said. \u201cOne of the things I love about it is for all the people that are in there and their kids, they all meet and ride bikes around together and get to the playground together. And they just become lifelong friends from all over the place. It\u2019s just a fabulous park to be in.\u201d\nMontauk Shores, a 65-year-old community perched near Ditch Plains \u2014 a surfer\u2019s paradise along Long Island\u2019s East End \u2014 has quietly shed its working-class roots.\nToday, it\u2019s a patchwork of 199 homes, ranging from weathered trailers to polished modular units, spread across 152 owned lots and 47 leased sites.\nThis $1.19 million trailer, an end unit with no immediate neighbors, sits on a leased site, meaning no property taxes, but a cash-only purchase \u2014 and no mortgages allowed.\nResidents enjoy a heated pool, a children\u2019s playground, a basketball court and a clubhouse, perks that amplify its allure. Yet this listing is just the latest marker in a decade-long ascent that has redefined the neighborhood\u2019s identity.\nTen years ago, such a price tag would have been unthinkable. Ken Hilderbrandt, a jet-ski rental business owner, recalled buying a dilapidated trailer in Montauk Shores in 1998 for $96,500 after scoffing at the initial $150,000 ask.\n\u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019 It was old. It needed to be gutted,\u201dhe previously told The Post. A decade later, he replaced it with a two-bedroom, two-bathroom modular home, investing $100,000 in upgrades like a wraparound porch and laminate floors.\nNow, he estimates it could fetch $60,000 as a three-month summer rental \u2014 or $5 million if he ever sold.\n\u201cBack then, you could rent them for $50 a month,\u201d he said, reflecting on a time when the community catered to surfers and locals, not a moneyed elite.\nThe turning point came in the 2010s, as deep-pocketed buyers began eyeing Montauk Shores\u2019 unbeatable location.\nIn 2022, a trailer sold for $1.85 million, then a community record. That benchmark was shattered in 2023 when an 800-square-foot oceanfront unitfetched $3.75 millionoff-market, as The Post reported at that time.\u00a0That record still stands.\nIn June 2024,another trailer listedfor $3.2 million, still unsold, while a 2,150-square-foot property brieflytested the watersat $4.4 million before retreating from the market.\nThese sales reflect a frenzy fueled by boldfaced names \u2014 Vitaminwater co-founder J. Darius Bikoff, hedge-fund titan Dan Loeb and film producer Karen Lauder have all staked claims here.\nJimmy Buffett once vied for a $430,000 trailer in 2005, losing out to caterer Janet O\u2019Brien, who outbid him.\n\u201cIt overlooks the break right there!\u201d O\u2019Brien told New York Magazine, touting its investment potential. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s waterfront!

But I\u2019d say, for the most part, it\u2019s probably more of a summer second getaway.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The crowdfunding entrepreneur who snapped up Kanye West\u2019s abandoned beachfront bunker has put it back on the market.\nWest\u2019s former Malibu retreat, designed by renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando, made headlines after the controversial rapper left it gutted and vacant.\nThe architectural gem was a literal shell of its former self whenBelwood Investmentssnapped it up last August for under $22 million \u2014 amounting to a loss of more than $36 million for West. Now, mid-renovation, Belwood\u2019s CEO Bo Belmont wants to sell,the Wall Street Journal reported.\nWest, who had his legal name changed to \u201cYe,\u201dbought the property in 2021for $57.25 million from the financier and art collector Richard Sachs, for whom the home was built in 2013. Kanye told a laborer that he planned to make the home his \u201cbomb shelter,\u201d or \u201cbat cave,\u201dthe New Yorker reported.\nWest\u2019s teardown job occurred around the same time that his erratic behavior and antisemitic outburstsmade increasingly frequent headlines, and got him cut off from lucrative deals with Gap and Adidas.\nThe home, built in 2013, spans 4,000 square feet, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms. The concrete, box-like structure stands on 12 caissons submerged 60 feet into the bedrock of the coast. Its former ocean views turned into ocean exposures after Yestripped the homeof its windows, marble bathrooms and electricity.\nWest listed the hollowed-out home for $53 million in December 2023. The price plummeted to $39 million beforeBelmont scooped it.\nRestoration of the rare Ando home is in full swing, the Journal reported. Framing, plumbing, roofing and electrical work have all been undertaken by Belmont, with the guidance of architecture firm Marmol Radziner. New windows are still in route, however. Belmont told the Journal that renovation costs will likely add up to $8.5 million.\nBut windows or no, Belmont is looking for an exit. The Journal reported this week on the CEO\u2019s plans to relist the home for $39 million, as is.\nBelmont told the Journal that selling now is a way to recoup his investors \u2014 whose crowdfunded contributions range from $1,000 to $1 million \u2014 as soon as possible. Belmont said carrying the property currently costs him about $1 million a month.\nThe home miraculouslysurvived the massive wildfiresthat scorched entire neighborhoods across Los Angeles in January. Belmont told the Journal that the fires may even increase the home\u2019s value, due tothe destruction of so much inventoryalong the Pacific Coast Highway.\nIf no one bites, Belmont plans to try again once the restoration is closer to completion in early 2026 \u2014 with a much higher price, of course, in the range of $55 to $65 million.\nThe Pritzker Prize-winning Ando\u2019s residential designs are rare and iconic, and they always go from millions, froma Lenox Hill penthouseto Beyonce and Jay-Z\u2019srecord-setting Malibu mansion. His work has been panned for being parking garage-esque, but others praise his modernist creations as sculptural works of art, including Belmont.\nThe Oppenheim Group, which represented West in his 2024 sale, holds the new listing.\nAdvertisement",

The Post has reached out to Goodman\u2019s reps for comment.\nIn a 2014\u00a0Garden & Gun\u00a0interview, he explained his initial move: \u201cI kind of had it with show business.\u201d\nHe and his wife had considered a certain Midwest hub \u2014 near his Missouri roots \u2014 before opting for Louisiana.\n\u201cThe options were St. Louis or New Orleans.

        "hed": "Amid development slowdown, one City Councilor wonders how much affordable housing is too much?",
        "subhead": "Chief Planner Kairos Shen emphasized Boston is not considering a wholesale change to its inclusionary development requirement",
        "content": "Housing affordability once again was a topic of debate at City Hall on Tuesday, with City Councilor Ed Flynn suggesting the Planning Department loosen requirements for developers to set aside affordable units in new housing projects.Boston Planning Chief Kairos Shen testified to a City Council hearing on the ongoing transition from the Boston Planning and Development Agency into the Boston Planning Department. The hearing ran for nearly three and a half hours and saw Shen and his top deputies answering questions from eight Boston councilors.District 2 Councilor Ed Flynn asked Shen about the city\u2019s affordability requirements in housing developments, which Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration has increased. For housing projects with more than 7 units, the city now requires developers set aside 17 percent of the project\u2019s square footage for affordable units, with another 3 percent set aside for tenants using Section 8 and other rental vouchers.\u201cI think it\u2019s time to revisit that percent, especially during challenging economic times, maybe for a period of five years,\u201d Flynn said Tuesday.AdvertisementIt\u2019s a somewhat wonky topic that has taken center stage in this fall\u2019s mayoral race. Wu campaigned four years ago on increasing the city\u2019s affordability requirement from 13 percent to 20 percent, and exploring the change was among the first steps she took upon assuming office in late 2021. It formally took effect in October. Challenger Josh Kraft calls for reverting back to a 13 percent requirement, to help reverse a slowdown in new construction amid higher interest rates and materials costs.Related: As Wu, Kraft, gear up for campaign, it's clear that housing will be a big issue in this year's mayor's race.Since its introduction, developers in the commercial real estate industry have vociferously protested the increase, contending that steeper affordability requirements would make projects economically infeasible. Shen\u2019s predecessor, Arthur Jemison, had suggested the agency could reevaluate boosting IDP requirements should the difficult economic environment continue.Shen on Tuesday said that, when he returned to City Hall last year to take the job of Chief Planner, Wu asked him to explore how the Planning Department can get more approved projects into construction. A number of developers with approved projects have suggested that the city easing affordability requirements \u201cwould potentially make their projects more viable,\u201d Shen said.Advertisement\u201cWe have not had any specific requests, and if there was or if there will be, it is my job to make sure that this administration considers it,\u201d Shen said Tuesday. \u201cThe one thing we have learned is that there is no blanket programmatic change to the inclusionary development requirement that we are considering at this stage.\u201dSome on the City Council worry that loosening affordable housing requirements could usher in a wave of displacement in quickly-changing neighborhoods like East Boston.Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffHowever, given the current economic climate and high cost of construction, Shen said lowering affordability requirements would likely not spur a flood of groundbreakings. And he emphasized that, with the Planning Department now a city department and no longer a quasi-independent agency, the Planning Department would not make any changes without consulting Wu and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing.\u201cThese are not decisions isolated from our colleagues who have expertise and knowledge,\u201d Shen said. \u201cThe administration is not considering a blanket relief or reconsideration of the inclusionary development requirement that is in place right now.\u201d\u201cMore case by case,\u201d Flynn added.\u201cYes, but as I said, the criteria is based on what the specific hurdles of a particular project is. Where it\u2019s located ... who are the beneficiaries, which community and physical location, all of those things would come into play,\u201d Shen said.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why does it cost so much to build in Boston?District 1 Councilor Gabriela Coletta Zapata, who chairs the council\u2019s government operations committee, said any hint of the administration moving away from the current 20 percent inclusionary development requirement should prompt a larger conversation among the council.\u201cThat would have huge ramifications for our city,\u201d she said. \u201cNeighborhoods like East Boston remember what life was like under a 13 percent IDP policy, and it\u2019s a movie we\u2019ve already seen before. Guess what? The affordability did not trickle down. My neighbors and elementary school cohorts that have now been displaced could not afford those luxury units, and they were ultimately displaced.AdvertisementCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

It\u2019s all about housing.\u201d\nBut perhaps the most important lesson is also the simplest: Let people know they\u2019re wanted.\n\u201cI overheard someone say, \u2018Who wants to come back to Pawnee City?\u2019\u201d Glenn recalls.\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to make it so we put the welcome mat out. You\u2019d be surprised how many people will come if we just say \u2018welcome.\u2019\u201d\nIf you\u2019re curious about making the move to Pawnee City, or just want to learn more about the homes and incentives available, you can visitpawneecitynewhomes.comto view floor plans, pricing, and project updates.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "\nMichael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones\u2019former home is now up for grabs.\nThe Los Angeles home, which once belonged to the Hollywood power couple, is now for sale with a price tag of $7 million in partnership with listing agents Alphonso Lascano and Bjorn Farrugia of Carolwood Estates.\nAccording to The Robb Report, the couple purchased two condos near each other in the late 1990s, and after combining the two units to create one large one, sold the home to its current owners, Judy Glickman Lauder and her husband, Leonard Lauder, the son of beauty mogul Est\u00e9e Lauder.\nThey purchased the home from Douglas and Zeta-Jones in 2003 and, after more than a decade, have decided to put it on the market.\n\u201cA living piece of Hollywood history, this home still reflects the timeless taste and style of its original celebrity owners, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, down to the last detail,\u201d Lascano told FOX Business in a statement.\nThe home is found on the 23rd floor in one of the two buildings that make up the Century Towers, which have housed many of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, including Diana Ross, Burt Lancaster and others.\nEncompassing 2,640 square feet,the home consists ofthree bedrooms and three bathrooms. The home\u2019s open floor plan allows for easy access to all the communal areas of the home, including the spacious living room.\n\u201cWalking into the residence, I was immediately drawn to the Old Hollywood glamour and the architectural details crafted by renowned architect I. M. Pei\u2014an icon of his time, who redefined luxury in Los Angeles,\u201d Farrugia said in a statement.\nA key highlight of the room is the floor-to-ceiling windows that line the room, providing picturesque views of the city. The room also consists of light carpet flooring, brown sofas and armchairs, wooden coffee tables and end tables, as well as a unique light fixture and artwork on the walls.\nJust steps away from the living room is the kitchen, which boasts tiled floors, dark wooden cabinets and dark countertops in addition to a breakfast bar for casual dining.\nIn addition, the kitchen also features many top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, including an oven, dishwasher, microwave and sink.\nConnected to the kitchen is theformal dining area, with enough space for a table fit for six diners. Behind the table is a wooden wall with a section carved out, creating space for glass shelves which can store dishes or decor. Below the shelves is a small drinks fridge.\nOne of the wooden panels connected to the shelves slides open to reveal a dedicated laundry room with a washer and dryer.\nAttached to the kitchen and dining room is the enviable family room, which is lined by floor-to-ceiling windows on one side, similar to the living room. In addition to stunning views of the city, the family room boasts a large flat-screen TV placed in a sizable wooden entertainment center, as well as a stone counter running along the entire length of the window.\nAcross from the television is a good-sized cozy sectional sofa, perfect for hosting a movie night with friends or just a casual night in with family.\nElsewhere in the home is the luxurious primary bedroom. One of the main features of the bedroom is the layered built-in shelving above the bed, which currently holds rows of picture frames.\nThe room also boasts one big floor-to-ceiling window lining the far wall, which also leads out to its own private outdoor seating area. In addition to a bed, the carpeted room is also large enough to house an additional indoor seating space.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A unit in the late Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid\u2019s only New York City building is on sale, asking $3.7 million, according to a StreetEasy listing update.\nThe eye-catching 11-story luxury condo is located at 520 W. 28th St., right along the picturesque High Line.\nThe building, built by Related Companies, was among Hadid\u2019s final creations. She died of a heart attack at age 65 in March 2016, more than a year before construction was completed.\u00a0She was the first woman to win that prestigious architectural prize.\nPulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic and author Paul Goldberger, who penneda tribute to Hadid in Vanity Fairfollowing her 2016 death, described her as an ardent feminist with a commanding personality and uncompromising vision.\n\u201cShe really had become far and away the most prominent woman architect in the world, and I think [she] took a lot of pride in that,\u201d Goldberger told The Post of Hadid, who was Iraqi-British.\nNow, a piece of this boundary-breaking architect\u2019s artful legacy can belong to someone new.\nThe 1,691-square-foot unit is the only one on its floor, according to its Compass listing. It includes five rooms, with two bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. The home boasts 50 feet of floor-to-ceiling motorized, sculptural windows overlooking 28th Street.\nThe West Chelsea apartment\u2019s current owner is a woman named Rabia Kamani, according to city records. She appears to be the sister of Mahmud Abdullah Kamani, the co-founder and executive chairman of BooHoo Group. BooHoo Group owns pretty much every fast fashion brand in the UK, including PrettyLittleThing.\nThe well-heeled residents at the 40-unit condominium enjoy a private IMAX theater, a terrace on the High Line, a 75-foot swimming pool, a gym, a spa and more.\nIn an interview with Alexagiven three days before her death, Hadid said she designed the West Chelsea building as an \u201cextension of the pavement.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought the building should have a connection to the High Line,\u201d she told Alexa. \u201cIt should project out, make some sort of gesture. When you have a neighborhood that is quite fresh and new, it can give you certain freedom to do new things.\u201d\nFreedom defined Hadid\u2019s philosophy and designs, which mixed bold lines and fluid curves into futuristic, organic structures.\n\u201cI think the story of the building is a story of trying to somehow combine Zaha Hadid\u2019s interest in unusual shapes \u2014 sharp angles and unexpected curves and swoops and things like that \u2014 with the practical needs of a New York condominium,\u201d Goldberger added. \u201cI always thought they did actually quite well with that. It\u2019s a very strong building, but it\u2019s also a very normal, livable building.\u201d\nThe condominium currently has two other units on the market. A similar two-bedroom unit listed more than 200 days ago, according to StreetEasy, for $3.85 million. A larger three-bedroom unit came on the market for $8.8 million in February.\nRelated Companies\u2019 big investment initially struggled to sell in its early years. Sales opened up in 2015 and seemed to stall out in 2019 at less than 50% of capacity,Crain\u2019s reported.\nBut the building still earned notable residents in these early days. Sting and Trudie Styler wereearly rentersthere. American businessman Wes Edens scored a 6,853-square-foot penthouse for $20 million in 2020 \u2014$30 million below the asking price, and Ariana Grandesold her five-bedroom condothere for $12 million in 2021.\nGoldberger described the construction of 520 W. 28th St. as a big investment by Related Companies, and a big risk.\n\u201cCommercial developers and builders in New York aren\u2019t always very adventurous,\u201d Goldberger said. \u201cAnd I think [Hadid] was viewed as somewhat difficult and demanding, which she was, even though she was also a brilliant architect.\u201d\nRelated Companies undertook this project and the construction of nearby Hudson Yards around the same time.\n\u201cI think it was really more of a showpiece, to show that they could do other things as well as build huge skyscrapers and Hudson Yards,\u201d Goldberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Related made a lot of money from it, but it\u2019s an admired building, and people like to live in it.\u201d\nCompass reps Michael Rubin and Todd Lewin, who hold the listing, could not be reached for comment before press time.\nIt is difficult to imagine that this condominium would have been Hadid\u2019s only contribution to the city if she had lived. Her architectural firm grew rapidly alongside her personal fame in the final years of her life.\n\u201cShe was a remarkable person, and it was a real loss for architecture,\u201d said Goldberger. \u201cIt was also a loss for New York, because who knows what else might have happened, had she lived.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s when he was among four appointees ousted amid security clearance disputes, as reported by the Washington Post.\nGarcia has contested that account, but couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nSince leaving public office, Garcia has carved a lucrative path.\nHe registered as a lobbyist with the Livingston Group in 2019 and 2020, then co-founded Health Supply US with his father during the pandemic.\nThe firm has secured $179 million in federal contracts, predominantly with the Defense Department, including $51 million earmarked for COVID-19 relief, per public records. Lobbying disclosures show the company has spent $1.25 million on advocacy since 2021.\nGarcia\u2019s property portfolio extends beyond Virginia. He and his wife own a $1.64 million home in Washington, DC, purchased in 2021, and another in North Carolina, property records show.\nThe transaction was brokered by Robert Crawford and Tyler Jeffrey of TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty for Vance, with Justin Tanner of Re/Max Allegiance representing Garcia. Tanner did not respond to inquiries seeking comment.",

        "content": "A unit in a Bronx co-op once described bythe New York Timesas \u201ca fantasy sand castle for the Amalfi coast designed by M.C. Escher\u201d is back on the market \u2014 as its community is in the midst of turning over to younger generations.\nThe $1.31 million listing within Spuyten Duyvil\u2019s storied Villa Charlotte Bronte spans 1,996 feet across three floors. Perched atop a cliff overlooking the Hudson River, the 17-unit co-op indeed looks like it belongs in a coastal Tuscan village, rather than The Bronx.\nUnits at Villa Charlotte Bronte havea reputation for rarely changing hands, but a recent uptick in sales shows a generational turnover is occurring at the exclusive enclave.\nThe property\u2019s ivy-wrapped exteriors and leafy grounds \u2014 including a cave-like spot called the grotto \u2014 attracts plenty of attention from neighbors and tourists alike.\nThe three-bed, 2.5-bath home includes sweeping views of the Hudson River and the Palisades. The listing boasts woodburning fireplaces, a large stone patio and an oversized eat-in kitchen with ample wood cabinetry.\nOwners pay $2,147 in monthly maintenance fees.\nUnits in this transportive riverside retreat rarely listed in the past, but sales have increased over the last year. One unit found a buyer for $915,000 in January and four others sold in 2024, according to records.\nDouglas Elliman agent Ari Susswein, who holds the current listing, said the recent uptick is a part of a generational turnover.\nSusswein said recent sales have been a change of hands between older residents and \u201ca lot of young, new families moving in.\u201d\nThe current listing was snapped up as recently as last summer, when the current owners purchased the home for $1.2 million. The owners made around $65,000 in improvements, Susswein said, including new carpets and window treatments, but are now choosing to move for family considerations.\nSusswein described Villa Charlotte Bronte as \u201ca real tight knit community.\u201d\nThese standout homes were originally built in 1926, when the area was still largely farmland. The developer, a lawyer named John Jay McKelvey, was inspired by European architecture, and reportedly found the rest of the city distasteful.\u00a0OneLehman College professor called the property\u201cprobably the most determinedly picturesque set of buildings\u201d in The Bronx.\nVilla Charlotte Bronte is visible from the Metro-North and Amtrak trains, the former of which has a stop in Spuyten Duyvil.\u00a0 The downside of frequent train horns and unwanted tourists is, however, balanced out by the rare opportunity of countryside living just 20 minutes from Grand Central Station.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The late, great Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s sprawling mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut traded hands this week, fetching $16.9 million in a deal that closed on Tuesday, according to a press release from its listing brokerage.\nThe new was first reported byGreenwich Time.\nThe sale marks the end of a nearly two-year effort by Moore\u2019s widower, S. Robert Levine, to part with the property, which helisted in September 2023for $21.9 million. The sale price marks the property\u2019s most recent asking price.\nThe transaction went under contract last month, as The Postfirst reported.\nThe couple purchased the Georgian Colonial-style home, constructed in 1900, in 2006 through a limited liability company for $9 million, according to property records.\nThe estate, which boasts a stone facade, stretches across more than 13,800 square feet and sits on a lush 7-acre lot.\nThe primary suite alone encompasses more than 2,000 square feet, complete with dual bathrooms, dressing areas and ample closet space.\nIn sum, the residence includes five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two powder rooms.\nLuxury abounds in the home\u2019s features, which include a glass-walled conservatory, an elevator \u2014 and a fitness center equipped with a hot tub, a steam shower and a sauna.\nOutdoors, a 65-foot swimming pool flanked by an outdoor fireplace complements a serene pond at the rear of the property.\nAbove the three-car garage, a separate one-bedroom apartment offers its own kitchen and bathroom.\nMoore, who passed away in 2017 at the age of 80, left an indelible mark on entertainment, most notably through her starring role in \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d a 1970s sitcom that earned her four of her seven Emmy Awards.\nHer cinematic turn in the 1980 drama \u201cOrdinary People\u201d also rewarded her with an Oscar nomination.\nLevine could not be reached for comment on the sale.\nThe home was brokered by Joseph Barbieri of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who acted on Levine\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cIt was an honor to represent this remarkable property, once home to a beloved TV icon,\u201d Barbieri said in a statement.\nThe buyer, shielded by an LLC in local records, was represented by Helene Barre and Fran Ehrlich, also of Sotheby\u2019s.\nNeither Barre nor Ehrlich were available to comment, and representatives for the purchaser could not immediately be contacted.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The Chelsea co-op where renowned \u201cFame\u201d choreographer Louis Falco rehearsed and threw legendary Studio 54 afterparties is on the market for $4.4 million.\nThe 4,200-square-foot home spans two floors of the seven-story co-op, with temporary walls that can be reconfigured into endless arrangements. The sprawling loft, constructed in 1901, is notable not only for its colorful history, but also its soaring 18-foot ceilings with large, south-facing windows at the core of the home.\n\u201cLight just pours in all day,\u201d said Matthew Solomon at Compass, who holds the listing.\nCurrently, there are four bedrooms and three full bathrooms, but that could easily be changed. None of the walls in the home are structural, Solomon said, so the space is fully customizable.\nWhen the current owners bought it in the early 2000s, Solomon said, it was completely open, and used as a dance studio.\nThere\u2019s elevator access to both floors, the second of which features a catwalk that connects the south-facing kitchen to a library and two bedrooms.\nThe blank-canvas residence could be repurposed as a dance studio, a creative space or a grand loft home.\nThe large loft served as both a living space and rehearsal studio for Falco, who famously choreographed that groundbreaking 1980 movie. Falco, a New York native born to southern Italian immigrants, achieved international acclaim during his career as a modern dance choreographer. His life was cut short by AIDS in 1993, at the age of 50.\n\u201cI think my works were gutsy,\u201d Flacoonce told an interviewer. \u201cIt comes from growing up on the Lower East Side.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Mayor Michelle Wu is hoping dorms might spark more office-to-residential conversions in downtown Boston to help fill up empty buildings and alleviate the city\u2019s housing shortage.During her state of the city address last week, Wu mentioned she would expand her existing conversion program to include developers that build dorms for students or workers. The general reaction in Boston\u2019s real estate sector: Every little bit helps, especially when construction has begun on only one conversion project so far.Wu first launched the program in 2023, offering significant property tax breaks over nearly 30 years to developers willing to convert downtown office buildings to apartments. The goal was to rescue older buildings and bring more foot traffic into a part of the city that still hasn\u2019t rebounded to pre-COVID levels, where around one-quarter of the office space remains empty. Last year, the Healey administration pitched in, by promising up to $15 million in state funding for Boston to help jump-start particularly significant conversions.Related: Want to live in a converted office tower? Boston has high hopes for its high rises.AdvertisementWith the new dorm concept, for college students or \u201cmiddle income\u201d workers, Wu adds yet another incentive: a way around a city requirement that 20 percent of all housing units in a particular project be set aside at a more affordable cost. This city requirement, known as Inclusionary Zoning, already doesn\u2019t apply to student dorms, and the Wu administration would waive it for developers that build employer-sponsored housing. (The affordable requirement would remain in place for other conversion projects.)In an interview the day after her speech, Wu explained that the dorm expansion could open up buildings whose footprints wouldn\u2019t quite work for splitting into traditional full-scale apartments but might work for dorms with some shared facilities, such as kitchens or bathrooms.One scenario that city officials have floated: encouraging developers to bring together multiple smaller schools willing to share a building with each other.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some conversations with smaller colleges and universities who might not have had the scale to do this across the entire building themselves,\u201d Wu said, \u201cbut would be interested in joining together with others in a consortium that would together master-lease a building from a private developer.\u201dAdvertisementAlthough only one project has begun, a conversion to build 15 apartments at 281 Franklin St., Wu and others in her administration say they consider the program to be a success so far. They point to the fact that 15 applications have been filed, with the potential to convert 20 office buildings into nearly 800 housing units. Seven of the applicants have been approved by the Boston Planning & Development Agency board, giving the green light for more than 350 units; city officials expect up to 200 units to be under construction by sometime this summer.\u201cOur goal has been to do everything possible to drive the commercial vacancy rate down, and to boost more housing throughout the city,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThis program does both. [But] it really takes a unique combination of factors to make this work between the financial status of the building, the valuation of it, the vacancy rates, and also the physical layout.\u201dBoston Mayor Michelle Wu delivers the State of the City address at MGM Music Hall on March 19.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeA city spokesperson said the state has already made $7.5 million available of the $15 million promised to the city of Boston for subsidizing conversions, though none of that has been awarded yet. City officials, she said, are also willing to consider including conversions in the program that are outside the core downtown area.Suffolk University\u2019s conversion of an 11-story office building on Tremont Street, with the Beantown Pub on the ground floor, gets widely cited as an example of how some older structures could be repurposed under the expanded conversion program. That project is underway, although the pub isn\u2019t going anywhere. Suffolk is not participating in the city\u2019s program because the university wasn\u2019t interested in a master lease arrangement and preferred to buy the building on its own. (As a nonprofit, the university doesn\u2019t pay property taxes on dorms.)Related: BPDA approves Suffolk University\u2019s proposal to convert Beantown Pub building into dormsAdvertisementBusiness groups, including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce and developer association NAIOP Massachusetts, expressed cautious optimism about the program\u2019s expansion. To Michael Nichols and the organization he leads, the Downtown Boston Alliance, the embrace of college and workforce dorms fits with his group\u2019s view that city officials should take an \u201can office-to-everything\u201d approach to repurposing these underused buildings \u2014 that is, not just turning them into luxury apartments.Several factors get cited for why Boston has lagged other major US cities in office-to-residential conversions lately. They include high construction and property costs along with the city\u2019s aggressive affordable housing and clean-energy requirements. A new downtown zoning change under consideration at City Hall could usher in more units, by allowing taller buildings in certain areas.Bryan Montgomery, a researcher with brokerage giant JLL, said some of these projects probably haven\u2019t started because their costs changed materially during the permitting process. After six to 12 months go by, the math may no longer add up.\u201cThey\u2019ve tried their best to expedite the permitting,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s a fine line between actually putting these programs in place and making them streamlined in a way that allows folks to act with conviction.\u201dDeveloper Joey Chilelli has been watching the process unfold from New York. His firm, Vanbarton Group, has already been involved in several big conversions in its home city, and he has been eyeing an expansion to Boston. The prices for downtown buildings in Boston, he said, simply haven\u2019t fallen far enough for projects to pencil out for him yet. He said it\u2019s smart for Boston officials to expand the program, potentially to create housing for university faculty or another sector that needs to accommodate its workforce.Advertisement\u201cI do believe we will start to see a lot more of these\u201d conversions in Boston, Chilelli said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s on the cusp.\u201dSynergy chief executive David Greaney, whose firm owns several downtown Boston buildings, said the affordable housing requirement makes it tougher to make the numbers work. Wu\u2019s expansion, at least, offers a workaround.\u201cThat is a step in the right direction,\u201d Greaney said, \u201cand may help deals pencil out better than they are currently penciling out.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

Nearby is Newburyport\u2019s bustling downtown filled with restaurants and shops, plus the beach is close for the warm days ahead.\n\nThis home has its own wide red brick walkway. It leads to an equally wide set of six stairs that ends at a covered porch that stretches around to the left side of the home.\n\nThe double-wide front door opens into a 25-foot-long hallway with the living spaces on the first floor of this 4,201-square-foot home. At the end of the hallway is a set of stairs to the second floor.\n\nGiven its age \u2014 it was built in 1879 \u2014 this house has separate rooms, not an open floor plan. But as an ode to its history, many rooms have pocket doors and fireplaces. The home has central air conditioning and forced hot air gas heating.\n\n\nTo the right off the main hallway is the 180-square-foot dining room with large windows on two exterior walls and a hardwood floor. The interior wall is lined with built-in shelving that is formed around a white fireplace, one of five in the home. A circular light fixture is positioned above the eight-person table.\n\nAcross the hall is the 287-square-foot living room with three large windows on its exterior walls. There is also its version of built-in shelving and fireplace. In this iteration, the mantle is wood painted white and the firebox is framed by brick.\n\n\nReturning to the hallway and heading deeper into the home, the 347-square-foot kitchen emerges on the left. The room is large enough to host a small circular table for four that is positioned near the third fireplace with a wooden mantle.\n\n\n\nThe working area of the kitchen is on the left side defined by a large island with white cabinetry and arainforest greengranite top with seating for three. It\u2019s something like an alcove, lined on all sides by cabinets (some with clear glass doors), the sink, stainless steel appliances (including gas stove), and a white subway tile backsplash.\n\nThe rear exterior wall has two large double-hung windows and a windowed door leading to the 219-square-foot rear deck.\n\n\nA short hallway leads to an 18-square-foot half bath with a porcelain pedestal sink, hardwood flooring, andNantucket Beadboard. Through another doorway is the 218-square-foot family room, which features its own fireplace, crown molding, and hardwood flooring. There are two windows on the exterior walls.\n\nThe primary suite occupies roughly half of the entire second floor. The 316-square-foot bedroom has its own fireplace, wide-planked hardwood flooring, four double-hung windows, and a coffered ceiling.\n\n\nFor a closet, there\u2019s a 158-square-foot dressing room with an island and a three-windowed bump-out and built-in shelving. There is also a walk-in closet. The 75-square-foot private bath has a single vanity with arainforest browntop, a bathtub underneath a window, and a shower stall with a clear glass door and subway tile backsplash. The flooring is porcelain tile.\n\n\nNestled under the stairwell to the third floor is an 18-foot hallway hosting the full-size laundry area. There\u2019s an added attraction: A door opens to a 49-square-foot balcony with views of the backyard.\n\nThis level has two bedrooms (204 and 244 square feet) that share a 32-square-foot full bath.\n\nThe third floor has the final two bedrooms, which are 176 and 187 square feet. There also is a 212-square-foot room without a closet that could be used as a bedroom. This floor has a shower-only bath with a single vanity topped by granite, Nantucket Beadboard on the ceiling and walls, and porcelain tile flooring.\n\n\nThe 536-square-foot apartment is in the basement and has a private entrance It includes sitting, living, and bedroom areas, and an 84-square-foot bathroom. The bath has porcelain tile flooring, a mahogany-toned vanity, and a shower with clear glass walls and porcelain tile flooring and backsplash.\n\n\nAlso in the basement is a home gym and a storage area.\n\nThe listing agent,Andrea M. O\u2019Reillyof Keller Williams Realty Evolution, said the current owners have rented the apartment through Airbnb, earning $22,000 over one year.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nIt\u2019s official: Spring has finally arrived! The spring peepers in the marsh behind my house have confirmed it by beginning their evening chorus last week.\n\nWith winter in the rearview mirror, it is tempting to forget about the cold and snow and move toward sunny skies, warm sunshine, and fresh new green growth. Crocus are blooming, the first shoots of daffodils are up, and my snowdrops are almost past peak bloom. One of my favorite early risers in the spring is dwarf or reticulate irises (Iris reticulata). They can be found in bulb catalogs in the fall and are best planted at that time of year. Fully perennial in our climate, these dwarf irises are so charming! The species features deep blue blossoms, which appear as the foliage emerges, reaching a diminutive height of 3 to 5 inches.\n\nAnother selection from this group that adorns the sides of my back patio isIris \u2018Katharine Hodgkin\u2019, with lovely pale blue, striped, spoon-shaped petals with a yellow background and flecked with matching blue splotches. Be sure to look for these beauties in the bulb catalogs this fall.\n\n\nOut atGarden in the Woodsin Framingham, the otherworldly flowers of skunk cabbage have emerged, their appearance ranging from dark maroon to pale green with streaks, spots, and swirls of red and purple. These are easy to miss at this time of year, but worth seeking. The flower, known as a spathe and spadix, can be up to 15 degrees warmer inside than the ambient temperature, an adaptation to lure early pollinators into spending the night, thereby better guaranteeing pollination.\n\nOne of the reasons I look forward to spring is the idea that everything in the plant world is getting a fresh start at growth, the resumption of an age-old cycle of dormancy and rebirth. Sadly, some plants still bear visible signs of last year\u2019s drought and the stresses of the winter season. None show the signs of the past season more thanevergreen rhododendrons. This reader\u2019s question resonates with me, especially as I have seen the same signs on the rhododendrons at my home and in the garden.\n\nQ.I have two large rhododendron bushes in front of my house that seem to have not gotten through the winter very well. The leaves and branches on the front half of both, that face out into the front garden, appear withered and possibly dead. These plants were here and mature when I moved to this house about 25 years ago and have never done this before. My question is what could have caused this and what should I do about it? Should I prune off all the dead branches and if so, will the bush regenerate and fill back in, or do I need to give up on them? They will look rather sad once half of the plants are removed.\n\nMSM, Dedham\n\nYears ago, I attended a lecture from renowned rhododendron grower and breeder Hank Schannen at hisRareFind Nurseryin New Jersey. He explained the top 10 things to do to grow great rhododendrons, and the top eight words were drainage. With few exceptions, rhododendrons do not like consistently wet or damp soils. But, almost paradoxically, they do like water and consistent amounts of it.\n\nNatural rainfall was in rather short supply last summer and into autumn. Prolonged droughts are particularly tough on older established rhododendrons, setting them up to enter the challenges of the winter season in an already stressed state. Once the soil freezes, those large evergreen leaves become a liability, as the plant cannot replace moisture lost to winter winds if the water in the soil is still ice.\n\nRhododendrons attempt to reduce that moisture loss by causing their foliage to droop and curl inward, thereby reducing the surface area exposed. I think of them as nature\u2019s thermometer: A quick glance at their foliage can tell me if it is above or below freezing for the day. The loss of water further exacerbates their stress, resulting in entire branches, foliage, and dieback. The stress also can weaken the plants, making them susceptible to soil-borne fungal pathogens that can cause foliage wilting and branch die-offs.\n\nBut there are several steps you can take to help your rhododendrons. The first step is to prune out as much of the dead branches and foliage as possible. It is important to inspect the stems to look for signs of discoloration in the wood, a good indication that a fungal pathogen in the plant\u2019s internal plumbing is at work. Be sure to clean up all the fallen foliage as well. Rhododendrons respond well to severe pruning, although it will take years for a large shrub to reattain its former glory.\n\nIf further pruning for shape and form is needed, wait until the growing season is here, especially if the shrub still has viable flower buds. Moving forward, be sure to cover the root zone with a good layer of mulch. This helps the shrub retain water during the hotter and colder months of the year.\n\nLastly, cast ahead in the weather outlook. If we are forecast for heat waves or extended droughts, water your shrubs deeply just ahead of the hot times. We often set up a sprinkler on a timer and let it run for a few hours a night during the summer. Our veteran rhododendrons appreciate the extra care and enter into autumn and winter ready for the stresses of the season.\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

        "content": "By Jim Morrison, The Boston Globe\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough homes in Boston for everyone who wants to live here. So where are home buyers going? We asked agents in which communities buyers are most clamoring to purchase a single-family home.\n\nJoselin Malkhasian ofLamacchia Realtyworks with a lot of out-of-state buyers and has noticed a clear trend among them. When she asks what towns they think they\u2019d be interested in, the answer is very often Lexington, Newton, and Weston.\n\n\u201cThose are the three that always get mentioned,\u201d she said. \u201cTakeLexingtonfor example. There are 26 single-family homes for sale in Lexington today. The lowest-priced home is asking $1.8 million. It\u2019s very rare that there\u2019s going to be something below $1 million in Lexington, but even if you get something between $1 million and $1.5 million, it will probably only last on the market for a weekend. It is going to be a frenzy with 50 buyers at the open house. Newton and Weston are even more expensive.\u201d\n\n\nThe median sales price for a Lexington home was $2.9 million in February,according to The Warren Group, which tracks real estate data in the state. Newton was $1.8 million and Weston $1.5 million.\n\nMalkhasian also said in this post-COVID era,Hyde Park($600,000) andWest Roxbury($825,000) are popular places for buyers who want something closer to the city, but wish to have a backyard.\n\nDave Twombly is the principal broker/owner of4Buyers Real Estate. He said regardless of what is happening in the economy,Cambridge\u2014 where 14 homes sold in February at a median price of close to $2.5 million \u2014 is always a draw for those who can afford to live there.\n\n\n\u201cIn the dead of last winter, I had clients in my neighborhood make an offer on a single-family home for close to $300,000 over asking, and they got beat out by another buyer because it was a single-family house in Cambridge,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Cambridge buyers are committed to living in that city and will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to buy a home there. Other communities just aren\u2019t like that, he said.\n\nAnd the surge of the spring house hunt hasn\u2019t even begun yet.\n\n\nMalkhasian saidMelrose($771,000) is a very hot community. It\u2019s got proximity to Boston, commuter rail, good schools, and a low crime rate. But on the day she spoke to the Globe, there were only four single-family homes for sale.\n\n\u201cThe communities where inventory [are] very low is where you\u2019re going to see the crazy bidding wars and the waiving of all contingencies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re even getting properties where buyers are obtaining a mortgage but are waiving their mortgage contingency [a clause giving the buyer the right to back out of the contract and have their deposit returned if they can\u2019t secure a mortgage] in an effort to compete with cash offers.\u201d\n\n\nRich Rosa, cofounder and co-owner ofBuyers Brokers Only LLC, also singled out Melrose. \u201cMelrose has been a hot market for my home-buying clients \u2014 mostly millennial professionals \u2014 for at least a decade,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cOver that time, single-family inventory has often been in the single digits at any given time. Home buyers like the downtown, the proximity to Boston, and the access to public transportation. Multiple offers on homes in Melrose were common years before the 2020 pandemic.\u201d\n\nKevin Sexton ofWilliam Raveis Real Estatesaid he grew up in Melrose and loves the city, but in recent years the quality of the schools and other services have deteriorated while home prices and tax bills have increased. He thinksReading($951,600) has overtaken Melrose in desirability because it provides more land at a better value.\n\n\u201cPeople come to Reading from places like Cambridge, Winchester, and Arlington,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cIf they feel priced out of Reading, they used to go toAndover($795,000), but since COVID, prices there have gone through the roof. If they can\u2019t afford Reading, they move out toWilmington($675,000) and evenTewksbury($725,000). Houses in Reading and Wilmington still regularly sell for over the asking price.\u201d\n\n\nHillary Birch is withCompass Real Estate. She sells homes all over Greater Boston, but her focus in on the South Shore. She said most of her buyers fall roughly into one of two groups: People looking to be close to their work in Boston, and those looking farther out to communities with a little more land and strong schools.\n\n\n\u201cThe first group is looking atQuincy($650,000),Milton($845,000), andBraintree($654,000), but predominantly Quincy, she said. \u201cThey still want access to restaurants and the Red Line T station. The second group is OK with being a little farther from the city and is usually looking inNorwell($992,500),Hanover($645,000), and if they can afford it,Hingham($1.4 million).\u201d\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t always been the case.\n\n\u201cQuincy has gotten more expensive in recent years,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your budget is, say, $800,000, you can get a little bit more house in a nice town like Hanover than you can Quincy. The development that\u2019s happened in Quincy has elevated pricing. And people who fled the city during COVID and moved to somewhere like Plymouth, they\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\n\nDavid Bates ofWilliam Raveis Real EstatesaidArlington($1.2 million) andNeedham($1.6 million) are two popular buyer destinations west of Boston. And the numbers tell the story.\n\n\n\u201cIn Arlington, the median sale price to list price ratio in 2024 was 104.25 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2023 it was 103.45 percent, which is very good. The median number of days to offer on sold properties was just six. It\u2019s practically impossible to get lower \u2014 kind of like it\u2019s impossible to have 100 percent employment.\n\nBates said there is reason to think there is even more room for growth.\n\n\u201cArlington home prices could get a bump from new Cambridge zoning, which eliminates single-family zones,\u201d he said. \u201cArlington also borders other very good markets, like Cambridge, Winchester, and Medford. It is ahead of the game inMBTA Communities Actand ADU [Accessory Dwelling Unit] approval. It also has a really good restaurant scene.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, the median sale price of a single-family home in Needham was up $205,000 from 2023 according to MLS data, and was 101.3 percent of the asking price,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s great schools, new construction for sale, commuter rail access, and it borders some prestigious markets, like Wellesley, Newton, and Dover.\u201d\n\nJim Morrison can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].

        "content": "Russian airport billionaire Valery Kogan and his wife, Olga, have found a buyer for their extravagant gold-and-onyx condo at Manhattan\u2019s landmarked Plaza Hotel, Gimme Shelter can reveal.\nOnce asking $50 millionfollowing Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, this Plaza pad \u2014 decked out like a mini-Versailles \u2014 was last asking $23 million and is now in contract, sources said. The final sale price, as well as the new owner, are not yet known.\nThe 5,302-square-foot apartment is on the 10th floor of the famed edifice at Fifth Avenue and Central Park South. It\u2019s a combination of two units, 1007 and 1009 \u2014 and it comes with Central Park views.\nA separate one-bedroom, 782-square-foot apartment across the hall, at 1008, is not part of this deal.\nWhile Kogan was once close to Putin, they are now at odds \u2014 fighting over ownership of Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo airport. Russian prosecutorsfiled a caseagainst Kogan and Dmitry Kamenshchik, claiming they failed to renationalize the holding company that manages the facility, according to Russian news reports. In Russia, it\u2019s illegal for foreign entities to control assets that are strategic to national security.\nThe sale comes shortly after the embattled billionaire couple sold their apartment at 15 Central Park West for $33.89 million,as Gimme reported exclusively.\nThe sprawling Plaza condo comes with its own castle-like turret, and features four bedrooms and\u00a04\u00bd baths.\nThe 21-story Plaza Hotel was built in 1907 in French Renaissance style, inspired by a ch\u00e2teau and designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh. The Kogans bought the two units for around $26 million and then combined them.\nThe over-the-top design details include 24-karat gold trim, pricey stone, Venetian plaster, vaulted ceilings, oversize windows, walls sconces and custom cabinetry.\nThe dwelling opens\u00a0to a foyer that leads to a great room with high ceilings, paneled walls, crystal chandeliers and inlay floors.\nThere\u2019s also a chef\u2019s kitchen and a formal dining room with columns overlooking Central Park, while a corridor boasts a built-in bar.\nThe main bedroom suite comes with a spa-like bath in floor-to-ceiling onyx.\nThe Kogans, currently in a massive global property sell-off, also sold a penthouse in Israel for $33 million and a condo at 515 Park Ave. for $14.5 million, which had first listed for $25 million.\u00a0In addition, they have another home in Israel that first listed for $259 million and is now asking a dramatically less $89 million, according to reports. Finally, the Kogans sold their 7-acre Greenwich, Conn., estate for $10.4 million. That home, at 18 Simmons Lane, once asked $20 million and also features turrets,as Gimme Shelter previously reported.\nThe listing broker of the Plaza Hotel apartment, Charlie Attias of Compass, declined to comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "If you\u2019ve got $20 million to spend and a one-story indoor slide is on your list of must-haves, an estate has popped on the market in Weston that could meet your needs.The home, at 67 Byron Road, is listed for $19,850,000, and is billed as \u201ctimeless elegance meets modern luxury,\u201d but with a hint of Chuck-E-Cheese thrown in. In addition to the two-story tube slide, there is a Winnie the Pooh-themed bedroom, a sci-fi vibe game room, a Scrabble-themed bathroom, and a wine cellar that looks like the setting for where the spies exchange microfilm in a thriller.By comparison, the home movie theater and indoor basketball court are relatively subdued, in that they look like a traditional movie theater and basketball court. (Alas, it\u2019s only half-court, but the tube-slide takes you there from the game room above.)AdvertisementThe master staircase features contemporary art.MGS Group Real EstateThe home, which was built in 2002, clocks in with seven bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a 4-car garage, and a whopping 18,725-square-feet of living space. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the interior is a grand staircase adorned colorful geometric shapes. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of contemporary art, but that can be removed,\u201d said Maggie Gold Seelig, the realtor who is handling the sale. \u201cThat does come with the home but that can either be removed by the next owner and either sold or donated.\u201dThe indoor slide connects the game room to the indoor basketball court.MGS Group Real EstateWhen the property last hit the market, for $17 million back in 2013, Curbed called it a \u201ckooky, cringe-worthy mansion.\u201d The home was then owned by Jeffrey Vinik, a minority owner of the Boston Red Sox who was reportedly moving to be closer to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Florida NHL franchise he\u2019d bought three years prior.Now that it\u2019s back on the market, Boston Magazine has compared it to the king of bizarro Massachusetts homes, the full-blown amusement park mansion built by the founder of the Yankee Candle Company.The indoor basketball court.MGS Group Real EstateBut while the interior is filled with idiosyncratic choices, the exterior is more adult and refined, a blend of modern and traditional with arcing roof lines and an outdoor entertaining area worthy of a resort.An expansive granite patio leads to two swimming pools, a pool house, and an apple orchard. Plenty of room for the adults to relax and entertain while the kids run around the Willy Wonka mansion inside.AdvertisementThe outdoor pool area.MGS Group Real Estate\u201cThe house is filled with a lot of whimsy,\u201d Seelig said. \u201cIt\u2019s warm, it\u2019s inviting, it can seat a lot of people for entertaining, or for cozy nights in.\u201dBilly Baker can be reached at billy.baker@globe.com.

From suburban Dyker Heights to pricey Park Slope, all of these neighborhoods shared increases in inventory and declines in median asking prices.\nThat translates to more options at lower costs for buyers, offering much-needed relief amid volatile mortgage rates and eye-popping asking prices.\n\u201cWe were surprised by seeing Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope on our list,\u201d Kenny Lee, an economist at StreetEasy, told The Post. \u201cWe are aware that the market has been competitive in these neighborhoods, but the data suggests that there is some relief on the way for buyers as more sellers join the market.\u201d\nBoerum Hill topped StreetEasy\u2019s list, which analyzed data from January and February. Boerum Hill clocked in a 26% decrease in year-over-year asking prices and a whopping 75% increase in inventory during the same span.\nBuyers beware, however, as the tiny brownstone-lined neighborhood\u2019s inventory only increased by 77 units. The competitive neighborhood saw price cuts in just 9% of listings, which ask in the range of $1.9million.\nThe inventory uptick is almost entirely thanks to new developments in the area, Deborah Rieders, a Brooklyn-based broker at Corcoran, told The Post.\n\u201cI think it is a great time to buy in Boerum Hill,\u201d Rieders said. \u201cBecause once this new development inventory gets absorbed, negotiability is going to disappear again.\u201d\nLong Island City, in Queens, and Brooklyn Heights came in next on the list, both boasting reductions in year-over-year asking prices. Brand new developments in LIC, ranging from rent-stabilized apartments to high-end condos, contributed to an 18% uptick in the neighborhood\u2019s inventory.\nBrooklyn Heights had far more modest inventory gains, but sky-high listing prices in thehistoric waterfront community dropped 23% compared to last year.\nUltra-exclusive Gramercy Park in Manhattan claimed the largest pool of recent price cuts, at 23% of listings. Coastal Brighton Beach, in Brooklyn, ranked second with cuts to almost 20% of listings.\nTypical price cuts, Lee said, tend to average between 3% to 5% in the city.\n\u201cBy slightly lowering prices, sellers are really trying to meet halfway,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey are aware that the financing situation is very tricky with mortgage rates still well above 6%.\u201d\nThis early-year data should be taken on balance \u2014 Brooklyn is still considered the most competitive market in the city. The same StreetEasy data also revealed that arecord-setting 34 neighborhoods in Brooklynhad median asking prices topping $1 million this year.\nInventory jumps of 51% in Dyker Heights helped put that neighborhood on the list as well, despite no changes to the area\u2019s median asking price of $1.44million since early last year. Bensonhurst landed No. 6 on the list.\nPerhaps the most surprising inclusion on StreetEasy\u2019s list was Park Slope, coming it at No.10 on roundup. A slight year-over-year rise in inventory and 21%decrease in asking prices in the affluent neighborhood, known for its opulent brownstones and proximity to Prospect Park, appeared to cool things down early in the year.\nSales activity softened towards the end of February amid stock market turbulence, Rieders said, but she expects things to heat up again once spring is in full swing.\n\u201cIf the prices have softened a little bit because of the larger inventory and new development, it\u2019s a good time to buy,\u201d Rieders said.\nAdvertisement",

Department of Buildings and Safety, but local leaders and residents were quick to criticize the slow pace of the permitting process, with one city councilmember saying it was \u201cconcerning\u201d that only four permits had been issued as of March 24, more than two months after the fires.\nThe first permit was issued by the city on March 5, clearing the way for homeowners to fix up their wrecked properties in the star-studded Pacific Palisades neighborhood, where some 6,800homes either burned to the groundor were seriously damaged\u00a0by the Palisades fire.\nThe owner of the split-level home near Rustic Canyon submitted blueprints to city inspectors back on Feb. 17, reported theLos Angeles Times.\n\u201cWe want this to be happening on your lot, too,\u201d Mayor Bass said at a news conference on Friday.\nAmong the first three permits approved by the city, two were for complete rebuilds: one in the Palisades section and another overlooking the Pacific Coast Highway.\nGary Lionelli, an Emmy-winning film and TV composer who owns the Palisades property destroyed by the wildfire less than a year after he and had family had moved into their newly constructed home, told the Times that he plans to have it rebuilt exactly as it was, in a bid to avoid delays.\nThe mayor has issuedexecutive ordersaimed at streamlining and expediting the rebuilding process in the fire-ravaged communities.\nAmong other measures, the city established a debris-removal task force to clear the way for rebuilding, opened a permitting center, and waived local discretionary review processes\u2014all in the name of speeding up the recovery efforts.\nAs of last week, 72 owners had submitted rebuilding applications to the city, and another 135 to theL.A. County Department of Public Worksfor rebuilding in unincorporated areas impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nAgain, the cleared plot of land has to be graded, or smoothed and shaped, to create a surface suitable for construction.\nBass said on Friday that so far, some 1,000 property owners have not opted in or out of the government-run debris-removal initiative.\nFailing to have all the debris removed could result in a lien being attached to a property.\nDuring an L.A. City Council meeting on Monday, politicians and residents alike voiced their concerns about thepace of the rebuilding process.\n\u201cWe want to get going,\u201d one Palisades resident said at the meeting.\nCouncilmember\u00a0Traci Park, who represents the Palisades section, said she found the low number of permits that so far had been approved by the Department of Buildings and Safety to be unacceptable.\n\u201cWhen I hear in the community meeting like we had today that only four permits have been issued, and we\u2019re on day 75 post-fire, that is concerning to me,\u201d Park said, according toABC7.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of interest in rebuilding, I suspect it is indicative of systemic issues that we need to continue to focus on.\u201d\nRealtor.com\u00aehas reached out to the Department of Buildings, seeking comment on the permitting pace and was awaiting a reply.\nOther City Council members took aim at the mayor\u2019s decision to hire Hagerty Consulting, a private firm, to oversee the recovery effort to the tune of $10 million, even as Los Angeles is staring at a $1 billion budget deficit next year.\nCouncilmember\u00a0Monica Rodriguez\u00a0slammed the move as \u201cobscene.\u201d\n\u201cWe have city departments who know how to do this recovery, who have been involved in recovery efforts in the past,\u201d Rodriguez told ABC7. \u201cAnd yet they can\u2019t be afforded the opportunity to hire the personnel that they need, but we can give a $10 million contract to an outside agency to help write a report for us.\u201d\nBefore any construction could begin, homeowners must have all debris cleared from their lots. For Palisades residents, debris removal is free through a federal program; but homeowners must opt in by completing a Right of Entry form, allowing theU.S. Army Corps of Engineersto access their properties.\nThe process is split into two phases: Phase 1 typically involves identifying and carting away visible household hazardous waste like asbestos, lead, other toxic materials. Phase 2 focuses on clearing ash and the top 3 to 6 inches of contaminated soil.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Home is where the art is.\nThe Manhattan townhouse formerly owned by pop art titan Andy Warhol will list on Thursday for $6.95 million, marking its first sale in more than a decade, The Post has learned.\u00a0And it still retains quirky traces of Warhol\u2019s residency.\nThis Upper East Side dwelling, at 1342 Lexington Ave., last changed hands in 2013 for $5.5 million and brieflyappeared as a rentalin December for $22,550 a month.\nThe current owners, who have held the property as an investment, never called it their own home.\nInstead, they leased it out over the years, said Loy Carlos, the broker representing the sale through Nest Seekers International\u2019s Global Wealth Office.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just ready to move on,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cThey really liked the provenance of the house. I think they were very excited when they bought it \u2026 at this point they just sort of want to divest some properties.\u201d\nWarhol\u2019s imprint on the 19th-century townhouse, designed by architectural luminary Henry J. Hardenbergh \u2014 whose portfolio includes the Plaza Hotel and the Dakota \u2014 is unmistakable.\nFrom 1960 to 1972, this narrow, 3,072-square-foot abode served as both residence and studio, where the artist produced some of his most iconic works \u2014 including the \u201cCampbell\u2019s Soup Cans\u201d and portraits of cultural giants like Muhammad Ali and Marilyn Monroe.\n\u201cHe lived there at a time when he was most productive and a lot of his works that we know, and are well known around the world, were actually done in this house,\u201d Carlos said.\nTraces of Warhol\u2019s era linger in whimsical details: a front door handle fashioned partly from one of his walking sticks, plus a kitchen floor streaked with green paint, a remnant of the garden-level space he used as a studio.\n\u201cThis is where he got his creative juices flowing and made art that funded the lifestyle he had for the rest of his life,\u201d Merav Shalhon of Essential New York Real Estate, previously told The Post. Shalhon noted Warhol shared the home with his mother, who famously picked up those legendary soup cans from a grocery store \u2014 now a Gristedes \u2014 across the street. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a grocery store in one form or another,\u201d she added.\nBuilt in the 1880s, the four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom prewar home reflects a bygone era\u2019s charm.\nCarlos sees it as a fitting parallel to Warhol\u2019s aesthetic.\n\u201cI was thinking about Andy Warhol and how his work was what it was. It wasn\u2019t, you know, pretending to be something else. It was taking something that\u2019s relatively simple. And what seems ordinary and somehow coaxing the glamor out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is that kind of house. It has all of the beautiful elements architecturally. The spaces are correct. The layout is correct. You have a nice feel of the home.\u201d\nThe townhouse\u2019s recent renovation blends modern comforts with its historic bones. A parlor-level foyer opens to a wood-paneled library and a living room with a woodburning fireplace, while upstairs bedrooms \u2014 two with fireplaces \u2014 offer ensuite baths and custom closets.\nThe listing highlights a \u201cbright windowed breakfast kitchen\u201d with top-tier appliances and a den overlooking a rear patio.\nZoned for live/work use, the property could transform into an art gallery or office, with dual entrances enhancing its versatility.\nFor Carlos, the home\u2019s value transcends its walls, enriching Carnegie Hill\u2019s tapestry of architectural treasures.\n\u201cWith these homes on Lex, Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue, etcetera, we\u2019re looking at all of the big houses, and we look at them like gigantic gems that are beautiful and coveted and for very good reason,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I think what we forget in the context of jewelry. When you have a beautiful gem, if you put all of these other smaller jewelry \u2026 smaller diamonds around it, it sparkles. It makes it look better.\u201d\nAndy Warhol left the home in 1972, 15 years before his death at age 58 following complications from a gallbladder surgery. It had been his for 15 years. In 1974, after sitting vacant for two years, Warhol rented it to his longtime business manager and friend Frederick Hughes, who was also ultimately the executor of Warhol\u2019s estate.\nA year after Warhol died, Hughes bought the property from the estate for $593,500 and stayed there until his own death in 2001. Upon Hughes\u2019 death, his sister sold the residence.\nToday, a private family trust owns the residence, and about 150 cats \u2014 descendants of Warhol\u2019s feline companions \u2014 still roam the backyard, Shalhon said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem so far removed from the history and the past than the newer larger buildings devoid of architecture and history,\u201d Carlos said.\n\u201cIt feels rather very gracious and charming. And it almost feels to me like if you close your eyes, you could almost visualize Carnegie Hill where there was a time when kids still played outside.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "Housing or train parking?The answer to that question could determine the fate of Boston\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure proposal since the Big Dig redrew the city map around the turn of the century. We\u2019re talking about the $2 billion realignment of the Mass. Turnpike in Allston alongside a new transit hub called West Station. This decade-long construction project, like the Big Dig, isn\u2019t just about transportation. It would open up roughly 100 acres for development \u2014 a whole new neighborhood, sandwiched between Harvard and Boston University.The possibilities for the city are huge. As former BU planning consultant Kishore Varanasi, at architectural firm CBT, puts it: Boston hasn\u2019t seen something of this scale go up on the Charles River since the Back Bay was created, back in the Civil War era.AdvertisementBut the fate of this enormous project could hinge on something relatively small: What will happen along a narrow stretch of land around where the new station would go, south of the realigned turnpike?Harvard owns the strip in question, as part of its Beacon Park Yard holdings, and would much prefer to develop it. The university recently started circulating designs for housing construction, likely a mix of affordable and market-rate units, in this spot. Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration supports this vision, along with many Allston residents; the mix of low-, mid- and high-rise buildings would go up between the station and a linear path that would run parallel with the train tracks, extending out to the river.However, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation has a different use in mind for some of this land around the new station: tracks for train parking and maintenance, as well as bypass tracks to whisk express trains through without stopping, avoiding the new station entirely. The state agency\u2019s newest Allston plan calls for two layover tracks, enough room to park four trains.Related: State officials want to save space for train parking in Allston despite neighborhood concernsThe clash over these competing visions spilled out into public view on March 12 at a neighborhood task force meeting. MassDOT megaprojects boss Luisa Paiewonsky came armed with a report outlining the state\u2019s future rail layover needs. The MBTA acquired 24 acres in the Widett Circle industrial area, south of downtown, two years ago for train layover. But with the Healey administration and Amtrak collaborating to improve east-west train service across the state, they argue Widett won\u2019t be enough. They need even more space.AdvertisementAnd their eyes are fixed squarely on this stretch of dirt in Allston.Although the layover debate dominated the meeting, it has loomed large for a while now. Initial plans for what\u2019s been dubbed the Allston Multimodal Project once called for many more tracks.Then the MBTA secured Widett, and Wu showed an openness to parking and maintaining trains there, particularly as an alternative to Allston.A year ago, state transportation secretary Monica Tibbitts-Nutt essentially promised there would be no layover in Allston. It was a pledge that did not last long.State officials subsequently let it be known that layover in Allston was still on the table. And in November, Tibbitts-Nutt made the official decree: There would be four layover tracks south of West Station. Paiewonsky then became the point person for this project, and an outside facilitator was hired to help improve discussions with the community.To broker a compromise, MassDOT\u2019s Paiewonsky pared back the layover requirement to two tracks instead of four in the weeks leading up to the task force meeting, and relocated them in one conceptual drawing to just north of the new station. The general reaction from Harvard, City Hall, and the neighborhood: Not good enough.They want a more in-depth analysis of a \u201cno layover\u201d alternative, as part of a tallying of the pros and cons. This acreage is valuable, and the general feeling is it could be put to better use. There\u2019s also frustration about the speculative nature of these layover demands, with no guarantee most of these projected trains ever get added to the system. The city obviously needs more housing, and that architecture could make the path to the Charles more appealing than a facade for the walled-in train infrastructure.AdvertisementPlus, there\u2019s widespread concern that by sending many Framingham/Worcester line trains in and out of Boston on that express route without going through West Station, the new transit hub won\u2019t ever reach its full potential.So why not build what the neighborhood wants? From the Healey administration\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. If east-west service gets expanded as intended, the state will need to park these trains somewhere, ideally near the end of the line. Plus, layover is already listed as part of the project\u2019s \u201cpurpose and need\u201d in its permitting documents. And the bypass tracks are simply aimed at ensuring the new station doesn\u2019t slow down trips for commuters coming from points to the west.All this back-and-forth may need to end soon. To hold onto $335 million in federal assistance, MassDOT needs to secure critical federal environmental approvals by September 2026. More than enough time, right? Not exactly. Paiewonsky indicated in the task force meeting that the project team is on a tight timetable. As a result, MassDOT will start filing draft documents with the Federal Highway Administration as soon as next month.Related: US contributes $335 million for realignment of Mass. Pike in Allston, critical financing for \u2018transformational project\u2019Paiewonsky knows she landed on a high wire, amid a tricky balancing act. She sees how Allston fits into a broader transportation vision for the state. But she also knows the leverage that\u2019s held by Harvard, Wu, and the neighborhood (whose state rep, Mike Moran, is among the highest-ranking lawmakers in the State House). Reaching some kind of a consensus will be important.AdvertisementTony D\u2019Isidoro, lifelong resident and head of the Allston Civic Association, made a passionate plea as the task force meeting wrapped up. Harvard, he said, makes a strong case for its vision. He added that the high cost of housing is tearing away the fabric of Allston\u2019s community, much like the turnpike extension did when it was built in the 1960s. He urged Paiewonsky and other state officials to be compassionate and do what\u2019s best for the people who live there. Her response: We would be glad to have that conversation.As a transportation pro, Paiewonsky knows as much as anyone about how to build a massive highway project. While those are rarely easy, it can be even tougher to build a great neighborhood.Jon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

        "content": "The Bar House is raising the bar in East Hampton\u2019s real estate market.\nThe eye-catching 9,000-square-foot modernist home, named for the two elongated bar-like structures stacked in perpendicular fashion to form the L-shaped structure, recently closed for $17.77 million, according to the real estate firm that found the buyer.\nThe sale sets a record for the town\u2019s Northwest Woods section, located between Sag Harbor and Springs, said Brown Harris Stevens agent David Tenenbaum, who brought the buyer.\nThe new Bar House owner, who works in tech, will become neighbors with the likes of actor Neil Patrick Harris and fashion designer Donna Karan, said Tenenbaum.\n\u201cThis property really spoke to him,\u201d Tenenbaum said of his client. \u201cIt\u2019s got so much privacy. It\u2019s sited on almost 13 acres, and it\u2019s surrounded by 500 acres of East Hampton town preserve.\u201d\nFloor-to-ceiling windows wrap the glass-and-steel house. One section offers treetop views of the landscape and provides cover for an outdoor living space below with oversized moon-like recessed lights.\nThe terrace contains a fireplace and an open kitchen with a pizza oven, a sink, a refrigerator, an ice maker, a built-in grill and a dining area. Around the corner is a curvilinear structure holding up that end of the \u201cbar\u201d with an S-curve entrance that, like an airport, leads to an interior bathroom. Outside, there are two outdoor showers.\nThe area overlooks a 60-foot pool.\nThe other section of the five-bedroom, five-bathroom, two half-bathroom dwelling is one story on ground level. There, a large living area contains 12-foot ceilings, radiant-heated bluestone floors and a double-sided fireplace \u2014 as well as a kitchen with marble countertops and high-end BlueStar appliances. There are also two bedrooms with their own bathrooms \u2014 plus laundry, powder and mud rooms.\nThe most unusual part of the home\u2019s interior may be the second-story-wing master bathroom, an open space where the floor, made from marble imported from Turkey, performs an unusual task.\n\u201cThe ceiling has two large shower heads that are embedded \u2026 they don\u2019t project down at all,\u201d said Manhattan architect Audrey Matlock, who designed the Bar House and worked with Hamptons-based Lettieri Construction to build the 2016 home. \u201cThere are no shower walls.\u201d\nInstead of grout between the tiles, water drains into a pan underneath the floor of the room, which measures about 15 by 20 feet, she said. \u201cYou just stand in the room and take a shower,\u201d as the bather peers out upon nature, said Matlock.\nThe Bar House incorporates the outdoors with the house, said Tenenbaum. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s modern, from every angle, from every room, you can see all of this nature,\u201d he said.\nAnnual property taxes are $35,042.\nIn the runup to the deal, Tenenbaum said he brought in the buyer to watch the sun go down.\n\u201cHe stayed for two hours because we watched the sunset on the property,\u201d Tenenbaum said. \u201cIt was just kind of breathtaking.\u201d\nIntermittent between the windows are zinc panels that on the outside function as design elements in the exterior while providing privacy \u2014 and on the inside deliver built-in gallery space for displaying large-scale art, Matlock said. \u201cThe idea was that a dozen large paintings are floating between glimpses of the forest,\u201d she said.\nThe property also comes with a sunken tennis court, geothermal heating and cooling, an attached studio and a two-car garage, according to the listing. It is protected by a chain-link fence painted black where native plants grow into the structure so that it disappears, said Matlock.\nThe design, she said, took about 1\u00bd to two years, and the construction about four.\nNorthwest Woods is the area north of East Hampton Village on the west side of Three-Mile Harbor, said Tenenbaum.\nThe sellers, who are New Yorkers, sold because they are moving out west for work, said Matlock. She said she is \u201ccrushed\u201d that the home was sold because it \u201cwas made for them, and they were so happy there.\u201d\n\u201cWe, as architects, also get close to the things that we make, you know, and sometimes it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh no, no, it\u2019s now going to someone else,\u2019\u201d she said.\nSusan Ryan of Compass listed the house in June for $18.5 million.\n\u201cThis is the first inland property in most of the Hamptons that I can think of that is selling at this price point,\u201d she said.\nTenenbaum agreed, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing up in the Northwest Woods that sold at this number.\u201d\nRyan described the Bar House as a one-of-a-kind dwelling with unparalleled privacy that will likely drive prices higher in East Hampton\u2019s woodsy section of town, which is known for its large lots of land.\n\u201cWhenever you have something that\u2019s unique that transfers at a high price point, I think people pay attention, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I think people will look to this area a bit more.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The housing market in California is flashing a key warning signal that could lead to a slowdown in home price growth or evenfalling prices in some markets.\nThe supply of homes listed for sale in\u00a0California\u00a0is surging, rising 44% in February compared with a year ago, according to data from the\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0economic research team. The national increase was just 28%.\nThe California surge is the fourth-largest annual increase in active listings among the states, behind only\u00a0Nevada,\u00a0Hawaii, and\u00a0Colorado. In some California cities, the effect is even more pronounced.\nNick Gerli, founder and CEO of real estate data startupReventure App, noted ina recent post on Xthat 5 of the top 11 U.S. cities for annual inventory growth are in California, including\u00a0San Diego, where active listings are up 61% from a year ago.\nRising inventory is usually an early warning sign of weaker price growth, as supply begins to outpace demand, leaving buyers with more options and forcing some sellers to make concessions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very realistic to expect that, based on the more than 50% year-over-year inventory increase in some of these California markets, we\u2019re going to see a big slowing in home price growth over the next 12 months,\u201d Gerli tells Realtor.com.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if prices trend flat across the state or even slightly negative by the end of the year, and particularly in certain markets,\u201d he adds.\nSome California markets might have also hit an \u201caffordability wall\u201don home prices, notes Gerli. In San Diego, for example, the median February list price of more than $948,000 is far out of reach for a family making the local median household income of about $104,000.\nStill, Gerli says the rising\u00a0inventory\u00a0warning comes with an important caveat, which is that California\u2019s housing supply is expanding from a state of severe shortage, and today just 0.6% of the state\u2019s homes are on the market.\nStatewide, housing inventory remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Gerli doesn\u2019t anticipate a dramatic price correction in California, but rather a more gradual market reset, supported bylow unemploymentand\u00a0mortgage\u00a0default rates in the state.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still nowhere near what we\u2019ve seen in Florida in terms of supply,\u201d he says. \u201cI almost view what we\u2019re seeing in California today as maybe what we started seeing in Florida a year ago.\u201d\nHannah Jones, a senior economic research analyst with Realtor.com, says that although many California metros have seen climbing active listings annually, inventory levels remain below pre-pandemic levels in most of them.\n\u201cThese markets are moving back toward balance, which can be seen in slowing price growth and moderating time on market,\u201d she says. \u201cSome markets have seen listing prices fall annually in recent months, but some of the decline is because of a shift in the mix of inventory available.\u201d\nIn other words, a rising share of smaller homes listed for sale has dragged typical prices down, a trend that has also been observed nationwide.\nHowever, three California cities did see annual declines in median list prices per square foot in February: San Diego,\u00a0Sacramento, and\u00a0San Francisco.\nSan Francisco saw the sharpest decline of 7.3%, followed by San Diego falling 2% and Sacramento losing 1.3%.\nOnly time will tell if the lower square-foot list prices in those cities will translate into lower sales prices and falling home values.\n\u201cAs inventory builds, it is likely that price growth will continue to ease and time on market will slow,\u201d says Jones. \u201cHowever, California metros tend to be rather competitive and undersupplied, so it is unlikely that prices will adjust lower too significantly in the short term.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The Town of Middleborough Friday dropped its lawsuit against the state over the controversial MBTA Communities law after agreeing to expand an existing zoning district allowing multifamily housing to meet the law\u2019s requirements.The deal between Middleborough and the state came after the town last month sued the state housing office for an exemption from MBTA Communities, the 2021 law that mandates cities and towns served by the T make it easier to build multifamily housing. The Plymouth County town had argued it already had a zoning district, created under the state\u2019s smart growth zoning program 40R, that allows for multifamily homes, and should not be obligated to create another one.Town Manager Jay McGrail said both sides should be satisfied with the agreement. Middleborough will meet the requirements of MBTA Communities, a priority of Governor Maura Healey\u2019s administration in its push to ease the housing crisis, and Middleborough gets to meet those requirements by simply expanding its 40R district, as opposed to crafting a new one.\u201cLocal control was our top priority in this,\u201d said McGrail. \u201cSo we feel very satisfied with the outcome here. We\u2019re expanding a district that we already had, that we spent years crafting. We\u2019re keeping our control over our zoning.\u201dRelated: Middleborough sues Healey, state over MBTA housing law requirementsAdvertisementThe state housing office said in a statement Friday that it had approved the town\u2019s plan to comply and would review the zoning once officials submit it.Middleborough town officials created the existing 40R district in 2021 near the commuter rail station downtown. Its zoning allows multifamily housing by-right, or without special permission from a board, up to four stories tall. To date, 174 multifamily units have been permitted there, a quarter of them set at affordable rents.MBTA Communities requires Middleborough to have zoning in place with a capacity for at least 1,471 units, meaning that if all of the buildings within the borders of the district were razed, developers could build 1,471 units by-right. As it stands, the district only allows for 549 units.Its expansion into the East Clark part of town will create the additional capacity to meet the state\u2019s requirements, and the same parameters for development will apply there as well. Middleborough Town Meeting must approve the expansion of the district.AdvertisementMcGrail said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll played a significant role in brokering the agreement.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysMiddleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law\u2019s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.The town sued the state last month after State Auditor Diana DiZoglio issued an opinion calling MBTA Communities an \u201cunfunded mandate,\u201d opening the door for towns to pursue exemptions from the law in court. Several other towns have since filed lawsuits as well.It\u2019s the latest point of tension between cities and towns and the state over the law, which lawmakers passed in early 2021. Ever since, some communities have pushed back, saying it is taking away their local control over zoning. For its part, the Healey Administration has pushed hard to enforce the law, seeing it as key to opening up the suburbs and towns around Greater Boston that have historically blocked growth to more housing development.\u201cWe were clear from the beginning that we\u2019re not against more housing. That is a priority of the town,\u201d said McGrail. \u201cNow, we feel like we\u2019re doing it the right way.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "By Andrew Brinker, The Boston Globe\n\nIt is a freezing winter evening, and Thomas Macdonald cannot find apartment 41A.\n\nHe figured it would be on thefifth floor of this 19th century building in Boston\u2019s Symphony neighborhood, but there, the highest number was 39. Now a bead of sweat dribbles down the side of his forehead as he leads a trio of Northeastern University students in sweatpants back down four flights of creaking stairs and into a narrow basement.\n\nRoughly 10 minutes of searching and two calls to the building owner later, he finally discovers apartment 41A, at the bottom of an outdoor staircase that is hidden by a stand of bushes.\n\nNow, he can go to work.\n\nThe current occupants of unit 41A sit awkwardly in their bedrooms as Macdonald leads the students around the basement apartment. The place smells vaguely of cat urine, and there is a network of pipes running across the ceiling that may, or may not, transport the building\u2019s sewage. Macdonald explains that if they want a three-bedroom for around $4,500, this is the most spacious option they\u2019ll find.\n\n\u201cYou have to be straightforward with people about what\u2019s realistic for them,\u201d Macdonald says after the tour as he walks back to his Honda Civic, parked hastily behind a food truck. \u201cThey already hate us.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cus,\u201d Macdonald means Boston\u2019s army of rental brokers, and \u201chate\u201d may in fact be an accurate descriptor of how many renters feel about them.\n\nThe word \u201cbroker\u201d is a charged term in Boston these days, invokinga sense of dread \u2014 a knot in the stomach \u2014 among renters who associate them with jingling rings of apartment keys, ill-planned tours, andthe often-massive sum they demand, known as a broker\u2019s fee, before you can sign a lease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat fee is typically equal to a month of rent, and combined with a security deposit and other required payments, can contribute to a five-figure upfront move-in cost in a rental market that is already jaw-droppingly expensive and stacked against renters.\n\nBut beyond the dollars,much of the antipathy toward brokersstems from the fact that many renters do not see what, if anything, brokers do on their behalf.\n\nWith the ubiquity of online listings, renters can easily search for apartments themselves, yet in many cases, they still have to pay a broker to sign a lease. And afterNew York City outlawed tenant-paid broker fees last year, Boston and neighboring cities like Cambridge and Somerville constitute the only major urban center in the United States where renters are obligated to pay.\n\nThat could soon change. Momentum is building for a law in Bostonthat would charge the fees to whoever hires the broker between the landlord and the renter, rather than allowing landlords to decide. Key legislators have signaled their support,and Governor Maura Healey has signed on.\n\nSome brokers have takenthat recent push as an affront on their profession, and warn that the housing market cannot function without them. Their job, they say, is to find renters a good deal.\n\nRenters aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expected to pay this guy?\u201d one of the students remarked under his breath as Macdonald wandered through the Symphony building searching for apartment 41A.\n\nMacdonald has only been a broker for a few years, but he knows the business. He wears a navy suit bulky enough for a professional wrestler and oozes with the confidence of a 22-year-old, which he is. He crushes energy drinks instead of coffee, and the empty cans litter his car\u2019s floorboards. He fires off text messages at red lights, because, he says, \u201ctime is money.\u201d He hopes to parlay the money he makes leasing rentals into investment properties someday.\n\nMacdonald is the youngest broker at Jacob Realty on Newbury Street, one of a handful of brokerages run by Boston real estate mogul Demetrios Salpoglou. He lives with his parents in New Hampshire and starts his day around 7:30 a.m., after an hour\u2019s drive to work.\n\nOn a recent day, Macdonald settles into his desk near a drafty window overlooking Newbury Street. The room fills with chatter of brokers calling landlords and loudly drafting voice-to-text messages to prospective tenants. In a back room, there is a wall with thousands of keys to apartments Jacob helps rent.\n\n\nMacdonald usually starts his days scanning Salpoglou\u2019s database of 215,000 rental units for apartments that are about to hit the market or that have lingered for awhile.\n\nThis morning, he has spotted a couple of one-bedrooms in Allston that are about to hit the market, both renting for over $2,000 a month.\n\n\u201cCan you make the moving costs any easier?\u201d he asks the landlord on the phone, angling for a sweetener he can offer would-be tenants, like a break on the security deposit.\n\nThe landlord says no.\n\n***\n\nReal estate brokers have been around in Boston for as long as people have needed homes.Brokers say they serve an important purpose: helping people navigate the cutthroat housing market to find a home where they can build their lives. But they tend to work mostly on behalf of landlords in this housing market, where homes are in high demand. Those owners typically have enough leverage to push the broker fee off to their tenants.\n\nSites like Zillow and Apartment List allow apartment-hunters to narrow down options, but in many cases, they can\u2019t tour a unit without interacting with a broker who has listed the place on a landlord\u2019s behalf.\n\nIt can be a lucrative venture. Macdonald would not say how much he makes in a year, but its an eat-what-you-kill business. Most rental brokers\u2019 compensation consists entirely of fees they charge on apartment rentals, and it can vary widely from broker to broker. A successful broker can easily make six figures by leasing expensive apartments at an efficient clip. Others who lease just a few units a month make considerably less. There are thousands of brokers in Boston battling for the listings and leases of the city\u2019s more than 300,000 apartments. On Newbury Street alone, there are several dozen brokerages.\n\n\u201cBrokers and leasing agents provide a valuable service, and we get compensated for those services,\u201d said Eric Shabshelowitz, vice president of the luxury real estate agency Cabot & Company. \u201cYears ago, it was landlords who paid the fee, but the market has changed.\u201d\n\nSome brokers focus on hawking cheaper rentals to Boston\u2019s flood of college students. Others work in specific neighborhoods.\n\nRob Oteri, who founded the rental site JPRentals, focuses mainly on apartments in Jamaica Plain, where he lives. He said he tries to maintain personal relationships with landlords and works diligently with prospective renters to help them find the best place for them in their price range.\n\nWhen brokers do their job well, Oteri said, the fee shouldn\u2019t be quite so painful. But theirs is a volume business, and some brokers simply try to lease as many units as possible as quickly as possible. That leads to instances, he said, when brokers show up to lead apartment tours without ever having seen the unit.\n\n\u201cI certainly understand the frustration with some brokers who maybe have a \u2018turn and burn\u2019 mentality about the work,\u201d Oteri said. \u201cBut a good broker earns their money by working closely with tenants to get them the best deal.\u201d\n\nMacdonald\u2019s day has taken him into Allston, near Commonwealth Avenue, where he has picked up keys from one of the city\u2019s biggest student landlords, Alpha Management, so he can take photos of Alpha apartments that will soon come on the market.\n\nHis first stop is a clean but tiny one-bedroom with a closet too thin for a person to stand in. It has nice natural light and a full kitchen.\n\n\u201cThis one will go fast,\u201d he says while taking note of the \u201cstandalone closet.\u201d\n\n\nAs he drives toward his next stop, he defends the value of his profession.\n\nFinding apartments without brokers, he says, would be harder, because there would be no one to cultivate and centralize listings and organize tours. And his knowledge of the market helps him find renters the best deals, which is his top priority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the free market,\u201d he says. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nThe next unit, a few blocks away, is quite different: An upper-floor studio with a big window and a sprawling view of the city.There\u2019s a new mattress, a large bag of marijuana on top of the fridge, and a fresh eviction notice in the entryway. Macdonald takes a few photos.\n\nThen he shows those Northeastern students the basement apartment and returns to the office, where he begins posting his photos and updating listings on Jacob\u2019s website. He also looks around for more three-bedroom options for the students.\n\nAround 8 p.m., Macdonald gets a text.\n\nThanks for showing us around. My roommates and I will be looking elsewhere.\n\nHe curses and lets out a sigh.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name of the game \u2014 I did all of that work, showed those kids around, and at the end of the day, I didn\u2019t make a dime,\u201d Macdonald says. \u201cGotta work harder tomorrow.\u201d\n\nView Survey\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A massive 110,000-acre New Mexico ranch, bigger than the city of Denver, just galloped onto the market with a staggering $68.5 million price tag, making its grand debut after more than 45 years under one family\u2019s reign.\nLocated near the remote hamlet of Fence Lake, this property \u2014 known as Atarque Ranch \u2014 has been a cherished retreat for the Yates family since 1978, a lineage tied to the oil and gas fortunes of Yates Petroleum Corp., which they sold to EOG Resources for $2.5 billion in 2016.\nThe decision to part with this rugged paradise stems from the passing of John Yates Sr., who, alongside his three brothers, acquired the land decades ago, according toMansion Global.\nHis death three years ago at age 93 has prompted the family to seek a new steward.\n\u201cWe will miss the ranch,\u201d Trey Yates, vice president of the family\u2019s Abo Empire, told the outlet, noting the sale aligns with a strong market.\n\u201cBut the market\u2019s good right now. It\u2019s a business decision.\u201d\nThe family, known for its recreational use of the property, issued a statement expressing its hope: \u201cSeeking a new steward to preserve the ranch\u2019s natural beauty, wildlife and significant Native American heritage.\u201d\nTrey Yates III, now 30 and grandson of the late John Yates Sr., carries fond memories of the land.\nAs a child, he roamed its diverse terrain \u2014 stretching from high plateaus to deep canyons and sweeping grasslands \u2014 uncovering relics of the past.\n\u201cYou never knew what you were going to find,\u201d he said, recalling the thrill of discovering arrowheads and pottery shards amid Native American petroglyphs and the stone remnants of early settlers.\nThe ranch, named for its Spanish translation \u201cearthen dam,\u201d doubles as both a thriving wildlife sanctuary \u2014 home to bull elk, mule deer and pronghorn antelope \u2014 and a functioning livestock operation.\nReal estate broker Jeff Buerger of Hall and Hall, who listed the property on Sunday, highlights its unique appeal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely well blocked out \u2014 it does not have a lot of public access,\u201d he told Mansion Global, emphasizing its status as a premier hunting ground for elk.\nThe ranch\u2019s remote headquarters, accessible via Highway 36 and roughly 160 miles from Albuquerque, features a four-bedroom, two-bathroom main residence, a three-bedroom manager\u2019s home \u2014 and an array of outbuildings including a metal barn, a log barn and equipment sheds.\nWith 26 wells, a spring and 105 stock ponds, the property also holds a rare water rights decree covering nearly 60 acres \u2014 a scarce asset in the region.\nBuerger points to the land\u2019s untouched allure, from its dramatic rock outcrops, arroyos and more.\n\u201cThere are really beautiful things about the land,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no light pollution, so the star scape is exceptional.\u201d\nHe added that finding a comparable property at this price in New Mexico, or even in Montana\u2019s high-end ranch market, would be a challenge.\nThe Yates family\u2019s roots in resource development trace back to 1924, when Martin Yates Jr. and his wife, Mary, struck oil with their Illinois No. 3 well in Eddy County, the first commercial success on state lands.\nTheir four sons \u2014 Harvey, Martin II, St. Clair Peyton (S.P.) and John \u2014 carried the legacy forward, shaping Artesia and the broader region.\nS.P. Yates founded Yates Drilling Co., later sold, while his descendants established Santo Petroleum in 2010. Alongside Abo Empire and Sharbro Energy, the family\u2019s diverse holdings reflect a century of enterprise.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "On a sun-drenched stretch of North Bay Road, where palm trees sway and Biscayne Bay glimmers, a real estate revolution has unfolded since the pandemic turned Miami Beach into a magnet for the ultra-wealthy.\nThis narrow, tree-lined street, long a haven for the rich, has transformed into Miami-Dade County\u2019s priciest enclave \u2014 with roughly 150 waterfront properties now collectively valued at more than $1.7 billion.\nFueled by a wave of newcomers seeking Florida\u2019s tax perks, balmy climate and laid-back luxury, the road has seen a staggering $1.19 billion in sales since 2020, with 24 deals topping $20 million, according to data compiled bythe Wall Street Journal.\nAt the heart of this frenzy is Robert Zarco, a commercial litigator who, more than 20 years ago, snapped up an acre of bay-front land for $3 million. He poured $15 million into crafting a sprawling 19,000-square-foot Mediterranean villa, complete with 11 bedrooms, a vast pool and docks for his quartet of yachts. Since the pandemic hit, brokers have bombarded him with offers, some soaring past $100 million.\n\u201cIf I told you I\u2019ve had 40 offers, that would probably be an underestimate,\u201d he told the Journal. Yet Zarco, now 64, won\u2019t budge.\n\u201cIf you offered me $200 million, I still wouldn\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d never be able to replicate this lifestyle. To build something else now would take years that I might not have.\u201d\nThe numbers tell a story of unprecedented escalation. Land that once fetched $500 per foot now commands $1,000 to $1,500. Nearly 40% of its waterfront homes \u2014 59 properties \u2014 have changed hands since 2020, often shattering records with double-digit price jumps.\n\u201cNorth Bay Road is the Park Avenue of Miami Beach,\u201d Nelson Gonzalez, a veteran agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, told The Journal. The street\u2019s cachet mirrors elite pockets like Malibu\u2019s Paradise Cove or Palm Beach\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Beach, where the superrich cluster in tight-knit enclaves.\nThe roster of residents reads like a who\u2019s who of power and fame.\nApollo co-founder Josh Harris scooped up a 9,400-square-foot, nine-bedroom estate for $32.25 million in July 2021, a steal compared to its $80,000-a-month rental listing under previous owner Marcelo Claure.\nIn 2002, Jennifer Lopez purchased the home at 5800 North Bay Road for $9.5 million. She sold it in 2005 for $13.9 million. It last sold in 2021 by then-owner Phil Collins for $39.25 million to an unknown LLC.\nSupermodel Karlie Kloss and venture capitalist Joshua Kushner quietly acquired a 15,000-square-foot mansion for $21.5 million in August 2020, nearly doubling the seller\u2019s purchase price from a year earlier.\nSoccer icon David Beckham and designer Victoria Beckham made headlines in October 2024, dropping $72.25 million on a 12,500-square-foot retreat with a spa and pool \u2014 the priciest sale in the street\u2019s history.\nShakira has held court here since 2001, when she bought a 8,700-square-foot mid century gem for $3.38 million; she listed it for $15.9 million in 2021.\nBelieve it: The list of names goes on.\nShutterstock founder Jonathan Oringer and his wife, Talia, joined the fray in October 2020, paying $42 million for a 20,000-square-foot spread once owned by Alex Rodriguez.\nEntrepreneur Rande Gerber and model Cindy Crawford opted for a $9.62 million fixer-upper in December 2020, later replacing it with a custom build.\nSteve Witkoff, a real estate developer and Donald Trump\u2019s lead negotiator currently serving as the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, purchased a 0.4-acre vacant lot for $8 million in 2020. He has since listed the land several times over the years. It was taken off the market in January 2025.\nMedia titan Barry Diller entered the scene in April 2024, securing a 1.5-acre lot for $45 million.\n\u201cNice street \u2014 nice bend in the road,\u201d Diller said of his plans for a family compound. Even Bee Gees legend Barry Gibb, a resident since 1981 with his $1.58 million purchase, remains a fixture, his 15,241-square-foot home a nod to the street\u2019s storied past.\nThe pandemic sparked this gold rush.\n\u201cA lot of people who came down during the pandemic, they\u2019re used to living in cities and walking, especially in New York City. They like that this is walkable,\u201d said Jill Hertzberg, a luxury broker with Coldwell Banker Realty.\nLower North Bay, near South Beach and Sunset Harbour\u2019s trendy haunts, has surged in popularity, while Upper North Bay \u2014 home to Zarco\u2019s estate \u2014 retains its aura of seclusion.\nNew or move-in-ready homes fetch top dollar, with buyers willing to pay premiums for instant gratification.\n\u201cThere is so much money coming to Miami Beach. They have more money than time,\u201d Gonzalez told the outlet. \u201cThey\u2019d rather pay an extra $30, $40, $50 million to have the house already built and you hand them the keys.\u201d\nScarcity has only intensified the feeding frenzy. \u201cAt this point, we have to sort of knock on doors just to get people to sell, and not even knock on doors \u2014 knock on their door and bring them an outrageous offer with a contract in hand,\u201d Gonzalez added.\nYet many, like Zarco, cling to their slice of paradise.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s selling,\u201d Hertzberg added. \u201cAt the beginning, people were thinking, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll go back to New York, maybe I\u2019ll go back to Chicago, eventually.\u2019 Now, no one wants to go back. No one wants to leave the paradise they have found.\u201d\nFor some, it\u2019s about more than money. Anand Khubani, founder of IdeaVillage Products, bought a $40 million spec home in January 2025, drawn by \u201cthe quality of the owners.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes you feel more comfortable when there are other successful business people,\u201d Khubani said.\nMichael Bay, the film director who paid $17 million in 2007 for an 18,000-square-foot modernist masterpiece, echoes the sentiment.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about the money. Nope, I want to live here,\u201d he told the Journal, shrugging off offers exceeding $40 million.\nZarco, too, savors the intangibles. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep in my bank account. I can\u2019t throw a party in my bank account,\u201d he says. \u201cSitting out on my dock watching the sunset at the end of the day, there is nothing like it. It\u2019s like the fountain of youth. It ages you in reverse.\u201d\nStill, paradise comes at a cost. Zarco\u2019s insurance has ballooned to over $100,000 annually, a fourfold increase since he moved in. Others plow millions into hurricane-proofing, a necessity in a region prone to extreme storms.\n\u201cIt would take a tremendous storm for the water to reach the house,\u201d Zarco said of his reinforced estate. \u201cThe house is not going anywhere.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The old Barnes & Noble in Downtown Crossing has sat vacant for nearly two decades. It\u2019s a historic building on a corridor of Washington Street that\u2019s both bustling with pedestrians and dotted with vacancy signs. Out front, there\u2019s a payphone that still crackles when picked up and a piece of street art designed to spark renewed vitality into downtown.Now, 399 Washington has new life, in the form of new owners, who bought it at a bargain-basement price.Earlier this month, Boston-based Hudson Group and Assembly Investments of New York closed on their purchase of the retail and office building for $13 million \u2014 80 percent less than its prior sale in 2017. That sort of discount portends a difficult future ahead for Boston\u2019s budget, which is largely reliant on property taxes. But, as new owners Noam Ron and Evan Oscar Papanastasiou expect, it also means they can lower rents to the point where they can actually attract a tenant to a building where the ground floor has been empty since 2006.The old Barnes & Noble in Downtown Crossing has sat vacant for nearly two decades. Here, it's pictured on March 6, 2006.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAdvertisement399 Washington was family-owned for decades, until 2017 when Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management and L3 Capital bought it for $63 million. They then invested millions more into a full suite of upgrades: working bathrooms and elevators, new mechanical and HVAC systems. They stripped off the two-story gray slab that hung over the building\u2019s entrance for years, replacing it with tall expanses of metal and glass windows. The owners started marketing the retail space shortly after buying the building, and completed upgrades in 2021.Related: Empty since 2006, this downtown building is back on the marketBut tenants never came. And earlier this year, with office demand still weak following the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and no rental income coming in \u2014 399 Washington ended up in a real-estate owned sale.The prospect of a freshly overhauled building at a big discount drew interest from several investors \u2014 including Celtics star Jaylen Brown \u2014 but the bid by Hudson and Assembly won. Now they plan to market the property at rents in the $40s per square foot, $7 to $10 less than the typical rent for Class B office space downtown, and around $20 less than what the prior owners would have had to charge, Papanastasiou said. Bringing in a ground-floor retailer, and resetting rents for offices up above, will bring an energy to the property that hasn\u2019t been seen in decades, the new owners said.Advertisement\u201cThat will cast a wide net for tenancy,\u201d Papanastasiou said. \u201cJust lighting up this building is going to help tremendously.\u201dThe ground floor of 399 Washington Street in Downtown Crossing has been vacant since a Barnes & Noble store there closed in 2006.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/Boston GlobeRon and Papanastasiou aren\u2019t alone. Amid a broad post-COVID reset in office values across the city that has long-reluctant owners resigning themselves to selling at a loss, investors and developers are spying opportunity, eager to snap up well-located spaces \u2014 and then offer them to tenants at lower rents.One such opportunistic investor is Broder, a Boston-based real estate investment and development firm that recently bought 15 Broad St. downtown. It\u2019s Broder\u2019s second time owning the building, which it sold to Brookfield Properties in 2016 for $32.5 million. In late 2019, just a few months before COVID hit Boston, Brookfield sold it to TA Realty for $46.1 million. Earlier this year, Broder bought it back, for $13.5 million \u2014 $5 million less than it first paid to buy it 18 years ago.Broder is privately funded with family wealth, and its portfolio has little debt, said managing partner Eric Svenson. (His and brother Ben Svenson\u2019s father, John Svenson, passed from cancer in 2007 and was a prominent Boston real estate developer, philanthropist, and co-owner of the Boston Celtics.) TA\u2019s underwriting was reasonable when it bought the property, Svenson said, but the market shifts since are inescapable.These days, groups that bought buildings prior to the pandemic and with a five- or seven-year mortgage find themselves with little option but to sell for a loss. That means opportunity for firms like his; Svenson said he\u2019d like to make several similar acquisitions this year.Advertisement\u201cA lot of sellers are feeling like it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we had ten times the available capital we have. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for three decades and I\u2019ve never seen opportunities like this.\u201dProperties like 15 Broad St. and 399 Washington St. that have changed hands for significant discounts can give landlords flexibility to offer tenants space for a discount, or invest in modern amenities \u2014 a crucial factor in today\u2019s leasing landscape, said Wil Catlin, a senior partner with Boston Realty Advisors. But these days, Catlin noted, many tenants consider offices more an asset than a requirement, and they prize amenities and places for employees to connect with peers. So while pricing is important, it\u2019s not the only consideration.One of the last remnants of the Barnes & Noble store that once occupied the bottom two floors of 399 Washington Street.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/Boston Globe\u201cThe question is pricing for what?\u201d Catlin said. \u201cFor a lack of a better term, it\u2019s got to feel good. You\u2019ve got to want to be there. If the owner is saying they get a $7 per square foot discount, and the employees and staff are not getting a differential experience, they\u2019re like: \u2018Uh, why are we here again?\u2018\u201dCatlin and other experts expect more deals like this as sales activity increases this year after a long slow period since COVID-19. Some of those sales will come as deep-pocketed global real estate owners pivot away from commercial real estate in an effort to curb future losses.Private equity behemoth Blackstone in 2023 told the Globe it would continue to pare back its office holdings. It paid around $156 million in January 2020 for a five-story brick-and-beam office at 179 Lincoln St. Last March, Blackstone handed both the building \u2014 and its $76.5 million in mortgage debt \u2014 over to Synergy Investments, according to Suffolk County records.AdvertisementMeanwhile Swiss bank UBS Group has been shedding office properties across the United States. In September, a UBS arm sold 400 Atlantic Ave., a six-story brick office facing Boston Harbor, for $30 million to the development arm of French financier Jacques Chahine, Suffolk County records show.That\u2019s 40 percent less than the $50 million UBS paid to buy 400 Atlantic in 2014, and followed the departure of long-term tenant Goulston & Storrs. Chahine Investment Corp. plans to convert the office to a hotel and restaurant, which would newly open to hotel customers a deck facing Boston Harbor that had been private for over 40 years, attorney Jared Eigerman wrote in a January letter of intent to the city\u2019s Planning Department.Over in Downtown Crossing, Papanastasiou and Ron said they\u2019re already in advanced conversations with several retailers to lease 399 Washington\u2019s expansive first and second floor, which are connected by a striking brass staircase \u2014 a remnant of the Barnes & Noble days. They aim to sign an office lease soon for one of the upper floors. A fully built out office suite on the fourth floor, for example, is ready for a tenant any day.\u201cWe\u2019re confident we can lease that to an office tenant this year,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe\u2019re bullish on the future of downtown, and on this building.\u201dThe new owners of 399 Washington Street in Downtown Crossing are hoping to lure a new anchor tenant to its two-story retail space.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff/Boston GlobeCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A storied five-bedroom, two-bathroom colonial residence in Queens\u2019 Addisleigh Park historic district, once home to baseball icon Jackie Robinson during his Brooklyn Dodgers glory days, is now up for rent asking $5,000 a month, The Post has learned.\nSpanning nearly 3,000 square feet, the dwelling at 112-40 177th St. in St. Albans offers a rare chance to lease a piece of American sports and civil rights heritage \u2014 as it\u2019s where Robinson lived when he clinched the Dodgers\u2019 first World Series title in 1955.\nThe move to St. Albans from Brooklyn in 1949 marked a new chapter for the Robinson family. With Jackie Jr. nearing his third birthday and his wife, Rachel, expecting their second child, Sharon, the couple outgrew their Flatbush apartment on Tilden Avenue.\nSeeking more space, they traded proximity to Ebbets Field for a larger home in this stretch of Queens, joining a burgeoning enclave in Addisleigh Park.\nThis vibrant community, already a haven for black luminaries, had begun to flourish, despite its origins as a racially restricted suburb.\nSt. Albans\u2019 transformation traces back to its early days as a railroad suburb for white families fleeing urban density in the 1900s. By the 1930s, restrictive covenants \u2014 private agreements embedded in property deeds \u2014 made for racial segregation in terms of home sales, a common practice across the Northeast.\nThough the Supreme Court had struck down state-enforced segregation in 1917, these covenants persisted, often required for FHA-backed mortgages. Change came in 1948 with\u00a0Shelly v. Kraemer, which deemed such restrictions unenforceable, cracking open the door for black families to settle in St. Albans.\n\u201cThere was a restrictive covenant on the deeds where homeowners were not allowed to sell to anyone outside of the white race,\u201d said Nadine Morency-Mohs of Jaymore Realty LLC, the home\u2019s listing agent. \u201cAnd there was a neighbor who was furious at one of his neighbors when he was moving and spitefully sold his home to an African-American.\u201d\nThat act of defiance, as well as the court ruling, sparked a shift.\n\u201cIt was challenged that it is illegal for these deeds to have a restrictive covenant, hence the reason why a lot of sports and entertainment luminaries moved into this neighborhood,\u201d she added.\nBy the 1940s, jazz legends like Count Basie and Fats Waller had laid roots there, turning St. Albans into a cultural hub. The Robinsons arrived in 1949, following Dodgers teammate Roy Campanella, who had settled there a year earlier.\n\u201cSo when Jackie Robinson moved here, he moved with one of his best friends who owned a nightclub in Harlem, from there a lot of the entertainers \u2026 learned about the neighborhood as well, and they also moved into the neighborhood,\u201d Morency-Mohs added.\nThe roster grew illustrious: Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, John Coltrane, James Brown and heavyweight champ Joe Louis all called it home.\n\u201cThey all resided in this neighborhood around the same time in the \u201940s and \u201950s,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is when the neighborhood started to change.\u201d\nFor the Robinsons, the move brought mixed blessings. Fans flocked to their doorstep, eager for glimpses of the family.\n\u201cUsually, Rachel was diplomatic with the intruders,\u201d Jackie Robinson later wrote. \u201cBut some of the liberties people took got on her nerves.\u201d\nSeeking privacy, they relocated to Stamford, Connecticut, in 1954. Yet their Queens legacy endures, tied to a neighborhood that became a symbol of racial progress.\nThe current owner, who bought the residence in 2005 for $525,000, is now downsizing.\n\u201cBoth of [the] children moved out. One is in college, obtaining a law degree, and the other one is just moved out and starting on her own,\u201d Morency-Mohs said. \u201cSo [the owner] was like, \u2018I don\u2019t need a big home, but I don\u2019t want to let go of this piece of history. I don\u2019t wanna sell my home. So now it\u2019s time to lease it out.\u2019\u201d\nRenovated over the years, the house retains its original layout and woodburning fireplaces.\nToday, Addisleigh Park commands premium prices, with homes averaging under $1 million, but recently trading above that threshold.\nDesignated a historic district in 2011, the immediate area boasts a tight-knit community with holiday events and monthly meetings.\u00a0Easy access to transportation is an added perk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an under-the-radar community and also it\u2019s walking distance to the Long Island Railroad. So someone can be in the city during rush hour and in like 15 to 18 minutes. It is also 15 minutes to JFK Airport,\u201d she said.\nSet on an 11,000-square-foot lot, the rental additionally features a formal living room with a fireplace, a dining room, a galley kitchen, a sunroom and a sprawling backyard \u2014 steps from parks and schools.\nRobinson was the first black person to play in Major League Baseball.\nOver the course of his decade-long MLB career, he earned the first-ever Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, secured All-Star status for six straight seasons from 1949 to 1954, and claimed the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949, becoming the first black player to receive this accolade.\nRobinson participated in six World Series. In 1962, his inaugural year of eligibility, he was enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn 1972, he died of a heart attack at age 53 at his Stamford home.\nAdvertisement",

We just won a championship, and in the same way they expect us to level up and step up our game, our ownership group and leadership continues to raise the bar, and this facility is a perfect example of that.\u201d\nStewart added, \u201cThe Liberty made this facility a true player-led endeavor, incorporating our insights to help us be our best, while strengthening our bond as a team and with the New York community.\u201d\nThe development blends old and new: the original factory\u2019s brick and timber structure will house offices, a media room and a broadcast studio, while a 40,000-square-foot addition will contain most player amenities.\nFans won\u2019t be left out, with plans for a retail and hospitality zone offering an \u201cimmersive experience.\u201d\nGeneral Manager Jonathan Kolb framed it as a competitive edge.\n\u201cThe New York Liberty strive to be the standard on and off the court and this facility will be a game changer as we continue our relentless pursuit of excellence. A key part of this process has been the active involvement of our players in creating a year-round home for themselves and their families, and the collaborative effort to redefine the standard of player care and experience.\u201d\nThe Liberty\u2019s momentum follows a banner 2024 season, with home attendance at Barclays Center surging 64% since their 2019 move to Brooklyn, capped by a citywide celebration of their first championship.\n\nAdvertisement",

Moreover, if it sells at ask, it would also mark the priciest sale ever completed on the island.\nThe most recent sales record there was broken in early 2024, when one of the first families ever to reside on the islandsold their co-opof 47 years for $2.09 million.\nLocated at 415 Main St. within the coveted Riverwalk Court, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom residence spans 1,433 square feet and offers sweeping vistas of Manhattan\u2019s skyline and the East River, all framed by towering floor-to-ceiling windows.\nThe unit is one of just two three-bedroom offerings on the building\u2019s penthouse level.\nInside, the open-concept design blends a generous living and dining space with a chef\u2019s kitchen featuring granite countertops, high-end appliances and abundant natural light.\nThe layout includes two ensuite bedrooms among three total \u2014 all accented by marble-clad bathrooms, 12-foot ceilings and plentiful storage. Additional perks include an in-unit washer/dryer and a private storage cage.\nRiverwalk Court also delivers a suite of upscale amenities: round-the-clock concierge service, a fitness center, a yoga studio, a children\u2019s playroom, an entertainment lounge, and a rooftop terrace showcasing panoramic city and river views.\nThe listing is represented by Greg Kyroglou of Modern Spaces, who originally brokered the property\u2019s sale to its current owners in 2013 for $1.5 million.\nThose owners, previously residents of Long Island City, were drawn to Roosevelt Island\u2019s calmer ambience and proximity to urban life.\n\u201cOnce they started seeing their options and how unique Roosevelt Island was and how intimate it was and how you walk around and it\u2019s very quiet,\u201d said Kyroglou, it sealed the deal.\nNow, the sellers aren\u2019t straying far.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just downsizing,\u201d Kyroglou added. \u201cThey\u2019re actually buying in the building \u2026 It\u2019s a three-bed, three bath unit and they\u2019re starting to travel more. So it made sense for them to downsize.\u201d\nThe penthouse\u2019s $2.4 million price tag reflects its standout features, Kyroglou added.\n\u201cJust in terms of size, it is over 1,400 square feet \u2026 you have full Manhattan views with the bridge and the trolley, so you see the tram,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a very unique setup in terms of the price. And that\u2019s why we kind of priced it aggressively.\u201d\nFor context, Kyroglou pointed to a neighboring property at 425 Main St., where an 11th-floor unit with 1,280 square feet and two bathrooms is under contract for $2.1 million.\n\u201cSo if you take that as a comp, we\u2019re actually priced pretty well,\u201d he said.\nThe listing highlights Roosevelt Island\u2019s appeal as a residential haven that balances seclusion with accessibility.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique setup where you can be between Manhattan and Queens and kind of get the best of both worlds right there,\u201d Kyroglou said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "ByMadeline Bilis\nEvery year \u2014 sometimes as early as February \u2014 Sept. 1 apartment vacancies start popping up around Boston. For renters in search of a new place, it marks the beginning of an open season of sorts, where thousands of people shuffle in for apartment tours across the city.\nAlthough roughlytwo-thirds of all leases in Bostonturn over on Sept. 1, it can still be a challenge to find the rental of your dreams. Beyond looking early and staying organized, there are some lesser-known tips and tricks for scoring your ideal apartment. So if you\u2019re on the hunt for a Sept. 1 lease, read these tips from the professionals.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of renter who knows exactly which neighborhood you\u2019d like to live in, try digging into the data, according to Demetrios Salpoglou, CEO ofBoston Pads, an apartment-listing website. Most neighborhoods have a month where the number of lease renewal notifications peaks; in other words, that\u2019s when the most apartments hit the market there.\nIn East Boston, for example,data from BostonPadsshows that real-time availability spikes in May. \u201cYou can see the increase in inventory going up and down in real time,\u201d Salpoglou said.\nSo if you\u2019re set on moving to Eastie, you\u2019ll have plenty of places to choose from come May. Bylooking at the numbers(and the graphs), you can figure out when to start searching in neighborhoods from Allston to Roslindale.\nDo you love a particular building but never see units for rent there? Try talking to the property manager directly.\n\u201cAs a property manager myself, I can tell you: We usually know which units will be turning over before anything goes live online,\u201d said Tony DiMarsico, broker and owner atNFP Realty. \u201cIn fact, I already have a list of Sept. 1 availabilities that aren\u2019t posted anywhere yet. A quick email or call to a management company can sometimes get you ahead of the pack.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not usually a good idea to start touring apartments if you\u2019re not ready to sign a lease and pay the move-in costs that day. \u201cThe Boston market moves so fast that apartments can get rented within hours,\u201d said Emily Downs, a real estate professional withKingston Real Estate & Managementin Brookline.\nIf you find something you love, come prepared with everything you need, such as a checkbook or enough funds in your account to complete an online payment.\n\u201cIf you really like a particular apartment and it looks like there are going to be multiple groups interested, it\u2019s a good idea to fill out an application ahead of your tour and learn what deposits, if any, are due upon application,\u201d Downs added. If needed, you can even put down a deposit during the tour.\nHowever, this maneuver is a voluntary way to give yourself a leg up over the competition. A broker should not ask for any money up front. \u201cYou areneverrequired to pay money to take a tour of an apartment,\u201d Downs said. \u201cIf someone is asking you for money to take a tour, they are a scammer.\u201d\nSome apartments linger on the market for months without being rented. When that\u2019s the case, you have a bit of negotiating power.\n\u201cIf you see an apartment that\u2019s been out there for 90 days, why not throw in an offer?\u201d Salpoglou said. You could suggest paying a few hundred dollars less than the listing price, for example.\n\u201cA landlord may just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve had enough,\u2019\u201d and rent it at a discount, he said.\nTry sorting your search by \u201cdays on market\u201d to find these units, or set an alert to track a given apartment for price reductions, allowing you to swoop in quickly.\nThe bottom line? Don\u2019t scroll past the so-called less desirable listings. \u201cThe ones with blurry photos or typos usually get ignored \u2014 but if you\u2019re willing to take a look, you might find a great unit that others overlooked simply because the listing wasn\u2019t polished,\u201d DiMarsico added.\nMany tenants who rent apartments on Sept. 1 lease cycles are students, meaning they might leave the city after classes end in June. In those cases, it\u2019s common to secure subletters for the summer.\n\u201cA lot of June-to-August sublets come with the option to extend, and those tenants are often eager to hand things off early,\u201d DiMarsico said. He called it the backdoor in: Move in as a subletter in June, and then at the end of the summer, sign a Sept. 1 lease to stay there as a tenant for another year.\n\u201cYou might score a great place and even get discounted rent or free furniture in the process,\u201d he added.\nEver see one of those cardboard \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs tacked up in a window? Those are often the ticket to a hidden gem. Consider driving or walking around a neighborhood you\u2019d like to live in to find one.\n\u201cIt sounds basic, but it works. Some landlords still rely on those simple \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs in the window instead of listing online,\u201d DiMarsico said. \u201cI actually found my own house during college this way \u2014 just driving around and jotting down numbers.\u201d\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

It\u2019s a one-of-one trophy asset that can\u2019t be replicated.\u201d\nCompleting the space to an elite standard could add another $10 million, he estimates.\n\u201cIf they were to spend about another $10 million on the restoration, they would get something ultra-luxury that nobody else has in Dubai at very, very high standards,\u201d Khan added. \u201cAnd I think it needs to have that level of spend on it to warrant a profitable outcome at the end when we come to resell it.\u201d\nThe property boasts exclusive perks: a private indoor pool, a dedicated elevator system \u2014 requiring a 2-minute, two-lift journey from the ground to the top \u2014 and 12 parking spaces.\n\u201cThe elevators and the lifts are super, super fast,\u201d Khan said. \u201cOne gets you to the 73rd floor, and then from 73rd, there\u2019s another lift that gets you to 107th or 108th, and they both take about a minute each.\u201d\nThe seller, Karl Haddad, chairman and CEO of IRC Invest, acquired the unit in 2020 from Emaar Properties founder Mohamed Alabbar for an undisclosed sum.\nKhan says Haddad, an investor juggling multiple ventures, lacks the bandwidth to oversee the buildout.\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy with other projects and other businesses that he has and doesn\u2019t have the time to run such a project,\u201d Khan told Business Insider. \u201cHe\u2019s not a developer, he\u2019s not a builder, or a designer \u2014 that\u2019s not his game.

But we\u2019ve had so much interest from the US that it\u2019s been overwhelming, and even several offers as well.\u201d\nProspective buyers include agents representing Hollywood actors, sports figures \u2014 ranging from basketball players to NASCAR drivers \u2014 and even a rapper, we hear. Boxing icon Floyd Mayweather is among those who\u2019ve inquired.\n\u201cThey\u2019re from various walks of life,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe had a huge amount of inquiries in the US \u2014 and I don\u2019t know why that is.\u201d\nDubai\u2019s allure for Americans may tie to its booming population, up 3.85 million since March 2020, with expatriates accounting for 87% of that growth, per government figures.\nThe city\u2019s luxury real estate market is sizzling, with the Burj Khalifa\u2019s 900 residential units fetching between $623,000 and $27.2 million, according to Bayut, a real estate portal.\nKhan sees the penthouse as a status symbol for globe-trotting elites rather than a primary home.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to live in it because the kind of people that we\u2019ve been approached by \u2014 these people are traveling all around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of a status symbol. \u2018I\u2019ve got this,\u2019 or \u2018I will have this.\u2019 It just adds to the portfolio.\u201d\nIf finished within 12 to 18 months \u2014 a timeline Khan deems feasible \u2014 the property could double in value, he predicts.\n\u201cWhoever takes this project on \u2014 and if they do it to the ultrawealthy level that it deserves \u2014 they will be rewarded accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe supply is not there \u2014 the demand is there for buyers.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "If this terrace were a theater, the city would be its stage.\nTommy Tune, the famed 10-time Tony Award-winning choreographer, performer and director, has relisted his Manhattan penthouse for $2.9 million, Gimme Shelter has learned.\nThe charming Beekman/Sutton Place dwelling comes with a dramatic, 2,075-square-foot terrace where Tune held some memorable soir\u00e9es over the years.\n\u201cI had a party for [the late actress] Carol Channing and 200 Broadway friends showed up,\u201d Tune told Gimme by email.\nThe penthouse, at 400 E. 52nd St., is in an Emery Roth-designed building developed by Bing & Bing in the late 1920s and early 1930s that was last on the market in 2022 for $2.2 million \u2014 $700,000 less than its current asking price.\nThe one-bedroom, one-bathroom residence is 900 square feet.\nKnown as the Tower, it comes with a stage- and dance-worthy terrace featuring stunning river and city views.\n\u201cThere are so many things I love about the Tower,\u201d Tune told Gimme. \u201cI love that you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the Tower, and I love that I can host a party on my terrace.\u201d\n\u201cI also love that 52nd Street is a dead-end street. You really get to know everyone on the block \u2014 even [actress] Uma Thurman,\u201d Tune quipped.\nTune also found it an inspiring place to create art. \u201cI\u2019ve created over 100 paintings in the Tower,\u201d Tune said, adding that he also loves \u201csoaking in my Jacuzzi and I can see the Chrysler Building.\u201d\nDesign details inside the penthouse include 13-foot ceilings \u2014 which Tune particularly appreciates for his 6-foot-6.5-inch frame. There are also hardwood floors, stage lighting and lots of windows to showcase scenic views.\nThe home opens to a great room with a dining area and a chef\u2019s kitchen. There\u2019s also a sunlit bedroom.\nThe landscaped roof deck features an outdoor shower and an artist\u2019s sink.\nTune, 86, bought the penthouse in 2007 for around $1.3 million, according to reports.\nThe building turned co-op in 1987.\nIt is in one of five Emery Roth-designed co-op buildings that make up a complex called Southgate, which has more than 400 units. Building amenities include a doorman, a live-in resident manager, a garden, a laundry room, a bike room and individual storage for rent or purchase.\n\u201cI love the community that Southgate offers,\u201d Tune said.\nDouglas Elliman broker Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a \u201cRHONY\u201d reality TV star alum who is listing Tune\u2019s apartment, agreed.\nAs for the up-leveled price, she told Gimme: \u201cIt\u2019s rare to see such an iconic living space coupled with a vast outdoor terrace in the heart of the illustrious Beekman and Sutton Place neighborhoods.\n\u201cWith supply and demand, scarcity and limited inventory being the characteristics of the new real estate archetype, this penthouse is like a Birkin [bag]. It is rare \u2014 like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Bensimon added.\nTune also owns an additional penthouse in the Southgate complex at 414 E. 52nd St., which was also on the market for four months last year \u2014 for $2.3 million \u2014 before it was delisted in July. The listing brokers were Corcoran\u2019s Leighton Candler, Jennifer Reardon and Bradley Comisar. That\u2019s also a one-bedroom, one-bath penthouse with a wrap terrace showcasing river and city views.\nTune bought that unit, which was once a ballroom with 12-foot ceilings, for close to $1.4 million in 2013 \u2014 and enjoyed entertaining there, playing croquet on the terrace and hosting fireworks parties with guests like Lauren Bacall,according to the New York Times.\nThe beloved Texan-born icon, who has become synonymous with Broadway and entertaining over the decades, also owns a home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nAdvertisement",

That was its most recent asking price \u2014 and the aerie made headlines earlier this year for being the priciest rental available in Queens.\nThat said, that price ties this apartment witha mansion in Little Neckas the most expensive residence ever rented in Queens.\nWhile the new renters get less space in this unit than its Little Neck counterpart, they certainly get better views. The penthouse at Skyline Tower towers 778 feet above street level.\nThe tower also offers residents a 24/7 doorman and concierge services, a community play area, a roof deck, a game room, a pet spa and a 75-foot-pool. Plus, it\u2019s one subway stop from Manhattan.\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom condo attracted a great deal of interest since itrelisted for $11,500 in January, according to Corcoran agent Michael Chadwick.\n\u201cAt one point I was talking with the reps for two professional baseball players and an ambassador from a foreign country,\u201d Chadwick said in a statement. \u201cEveryone wanted this apartment!\u201d\nDespite the competition, Mitchell and Bee Miles won out. Mitchell is an entrepreneur, a Christian influencer and a mental health advocate, according to his personal website. He founded the business consulting company NeWell.

The key system in her building was more like a hotel, using key cards rather than the traditional metal keys.\n\u201cSo the doors to all of the apartments in the building were a key card system. So it wasn\u2019t like a key that you had to turn and lock. It was just like a hotel key card that you would scan and the door would open,\u201d she went on.\n\u201cObviously, you need a key card to open the door, but they also had a deadbolt for an extra layer of protection.\u201d\nBartlett admitted that often, when she slept, she would just close the door and not deadbolt it because the man she was dating at the time would sometimes come by later and had his own key.\n\u201cOne very, very random weeknight, around 11:45 to midnight, I was going to bed. I had, like, taken my melatonin, my phone was on \u2018do not disturb,\u2019 and I was about to fall asleep. I was kind of halfway asleep,\u201d she recalled.\n\u201cAnd since the doors had an electric system, they were very heavy doors, so they would make a very loud noise when they would open or close. So I heard the door open, but this was not a weird thing to happen. Like I said, I thought this was my boyfriend at the time.\u201d\nHowever, what seemed innocent turned out to be the influencer\u2019s worst nightmare as she quickly discovered that the man who had entered her home was not her boyfriend.\n\u201cI would say five minutes went by, and I was hearing rustling around and somebody trying to turn on the light switches \u2014 which were kind of hard to turn on \u2014 moving things around,\u201d Bartlett added. \u201cSo eventually, I\u2019m just like, \u2018Hello, hello?\u2019 and I am calling out his name and I hear a man\u2019s voice say, \u2018No, this is housekeeping.'\u201d\nThe 25-year-old confessed that her \u201cheart sunk to my feet\u201d in that moment, and she began looking around for what she could use to protect herself, eventually grabbing her tripod as a weapon before inching toward the living room to confront the intruder.\n\u201cI hear this man running out, and the door slams shut. I open the door, and I see a man running down the hallway and running down the stairs. I called my building, I called the police. The doorman came, and basically everyone in the building told me that they didn\u2019t believe me, which was really horrible, and they literally asked me if I was hallucinating.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cNext night, the same thing happens to another girl in the same building. Everybody finally believes me now. A few days pass, and they actually end up catching this man in the service elevator,\u201d she added.\nHowever, the influencer revealed that the police were unable to make an arrest.\n\u201cBecause my building did not have any \u2018No trespassing\u2019 signs anywhere, legally, they couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo they just had to let him go. The same thing happened to about I want to say three or four women in the building I was living in, and I really don\u2019t think that it was targeted, but I actually don\u2019t know.\n\u201cMonths later, finally they were able to arrest him or do something. I don\u2019t actually know what they did, I moved out.\u201d\nAt the end of the clip, the content creator urged fans to lock their doors even if they are living in a \u201cluxury building.\u201d\nPeople on the web flocked to the comments section and expressed their shock at the situation, as many thanked the influencer for sharing her story.\nAccording to attorneyGirvin Ferlazzo, \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs are not mandatory in New York City and trespassing can still be considered illegal if there are no signs posted.\nAdvertisement",

It\u2019s in my blood.\u201d\nBut now, Douglass has listed his own apartment \u2014 in what social commentator Tom Wolfe dubbed one of the city\u2019s \u201cGood Buildings\u201d \u2014 for $4.29 million.\nHe bought the three-bedroom, three-bathroom co-op in 2015 for $3.55 million, according to property records.\nThe eighth-floor unit opens to a foyer that leads to a large living room with high ceilings, herringbone floors, a restored marble woodburning fireplace and large picture windows overlooking the water. There\u2019s also an eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen and a butler\u2019s pantry with a wet bar and wine storage.\nThe main bedroom features a large walk-in closet and an ensuite bath. The home also boasts lots of storage, custom closets and surround sound.\nThe couple aren\u2019t in the city as much anymore, spending more time in \u201cwarmer locales.\u201d (Pres. Donald Trump nominated Douglass to be the US ambassador to the Bahamas during his first term, but Pres. Joe Biden rescinded the offer.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u00a0bittersweet decision, but it\u2019s time for someone else to create new memories here.

This Winthrop condo could be your dream home.\nListed at $299,000, 203 Winthrop Shore Drive Apartment 8 is a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 764 square feet. Located on the fourth floor of an eight-unit building that was constructed in 1900 and converted to condos in 2004, the unit provides stunning views of Winthrop Beach.\nClimb up a series of steps to the common entrance, which is on the side of the building. Then head up several flights of stairs to the unit\u2019s entrance, which welcomes you in the 142-square-foot living room that was freshly painted this year. Featuring oak floors, a vaulted ceiling, and oversized beams, the space has a ceiling fan that will provide additional breezes during the summer. The living room has a trio of windows that stream in natural light off the ocean. It also has a closet.\n\u201cIt has a great water view from the living room,\u201d saidCharles Roderickof eXp Realty, who has thelisting.\nContinue down the hallway to the 95-square-foot kitchen, which features white cabinetry and laminate countertops. Compact stainless steel appliances, which were purchased in 2018, include a dishwasher, an electric range, and a refrigerator. A single window provides plenty of natural light, and the kitchen also provides a second exit through the back staircase.\nNext door is the bathroom, which features a gray tiled shower that includes a seated area inside. There\u2019s a white vanity and a single window.\nWhite French doors open to the corner bedroom, a 225-square-foot space with two bright windows with south and west exposures. The window with a western exposure reveals the skyline of downtown Boston at a distance. The bedroom also has a closet.\nThe home has a monthly HOA fee of $442, which includes flood insurance. In the basement, you\u2019ll find community coin-operated washers and dryers, and the unit\u2019s separate storage space, which Roderick estimates measures around 30 square feet. The unit comes with one off-street parking space, and guest parking is also available. If driving isn\u2019t your thing, Winthrop has several MBTA bus lines that connect to downtown Boston.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "By Billy Baker, The Boston Globe\n\nIf you\u2019ve got $20 million to spend and a one-story indoor slide is on your list of must-haves, an estate has popped on the market in Weston that could meet your needs.\n\nThe home, at67 Byron Road, is listed for $19,850,000, and is billed as \u201ctimeless elegance meets modern luxury,\u201d but with a hint of Chuck-E-Cheese thrown in. In addition to the two-story tube slide, there is a Winnie the Pooh-themed bedroom, a sci-fi vibe game room, a Scrabble-themed bathroom, and a wine cellar that looks like the setting for where the spies exchange microfilm in a thriller.\n\nBy comparison, the home movie theater and indoor basketball court are relatively subdued, in that they look like a traditional movie theater and basketball court. (Alas, it\u2019s only half-court, but the tube-slide takes you there from the game room above.)\n\n\nThe home, which was built in 2002, clocks in with seven bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a 4-car garage, and a whopping 18,725-square-feet of living space. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the interior is a grand staircase adorned colorful geometric shapes. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of contemporary art, but that can be removed,\u201d saidMaggie Gold Seelig, the realtor who is handling the sale. \u201cThat does come with the home but that can either be removed by the next owner and either sold or donated.\u201d\n\n\nWhen the property last hit the market, for $17 million back in 2013,Curbedcalled it a \u201ckooky, cringe-worthy mansion.\u201d The home was then owned by Jeffrey Vinik, a minority owner of the Boston Red Sox who was reportedly moving to be closer to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Florida NHL franchise he\u2019d bought three years prior.\n\nNow that it\u2019s back on the market,Boston Magazinehas compared it to the king of bizarro Massachusetts homes, the full-blownamusement park mansionbuilt by the founder of the Yankee Candle Company.\n\n\nBut while the interior is filled with idiosyncratic choices, the exterior is more adult and refined, a blend of modern and traditional with arcing roof lines and an outdoor entertaining area worthy of a resort.\n\nAn expansive granite patio leads to two swimming pools, a pool house, and an apple orchard. Plenty of room for the adults to relax and entertain while the kids run around the Willy Wonka mansion inside.\n\n\n\u201cThe house is filled with a lot of whimsy,\u201d Seelig said. \u201cIt\u2019s warm, it\u2019s inviting, it can seat a lot of people for entertaining, or for cozy nights in.\u201d\n\n\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "28-year-old MIT grad Burhan Azeem is leading big housing efforts, quietly",
        "content": "The pressure was tightening on Burhan Azeem.Azeem, a 28-year-old, second-term Cambridge city councilor, was working to advance a controversial proposal he hoped could solve the city\u2019s deep housing shortage: allowing six-story multifamily buildings anywhere in Cambridge. Opposition from some neighborhood groups was growing, and he needed to swing the momentum.Azeem decided to play small-ball, visiting community groups to make his case. In one instance, Azeem appealed to a synagogue, noting that its members cannot drive on the Sabbath, and therefore, he said, would benefit from living in dense housing near public transit.It was a small but meaningful expression of the political savvy that has helped Azeem transform Cambridge\u2019s approach to building new homes.Since being elected in 2021, Azeem has helped write and pass some of the broadest housing reforms Cambridge, or anywhere else in Massachusetts, has seen in years \u2014 including the six-story zoning, which passed in February and is regarded as one of the most ambitious efforts to spur new housing by any city in the country.\u201cPeople support me because I write policies that have a real chance to make a difference in the housing crisis,\u201d Azeem said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t doing that, I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job.\u201dRelated: In dramatic overhaul, Cambridge becomes one of the first cities in Mass. to eliminate single-family zoningAdvertisementAzeem\u2019s political rise, and policy success, has coincided with housing emerging as one of the most important local issues in Massachusetts, and a growing movement of younger, politically engaged residents who are pushing for solutions. In Cambridge \u2014 which has some of the steepest rents in the nation \u2014 that is especially true.AdvertisementTo the younger residents advocating for more homes, Azeem is an ideal representative.\u201cHousing is the preeminent challenge in the lives of a lot of people who live here,\u201d said Jarred Johnson, a local advocate who supports Azeem. \u201cSo when someone like Burhan comes along and presents a clear vision to deal with that problem and actually follows through on it, people respond to that.\u201dAzeem said his fixation on the housing shortage is personal. He was born in Pakistan, then moved to Staten Island, N.Y., when he was 4 after his parents won a visa lottery, hoping to pay off medical debt with new, better-paying jobs. In the United States, his family moved often, sometimes staying with friends in overcrowded apartments.Azeem excelled in high school \u2014 a local newspaper once referred to him as a genius \u2014 and won a full scholarship to MIT, where he studied material science and engineering. These days, Azeem is the head of artificial intelligence at Tandem, a language learning startup.Cambridge City Councilors Burhan Azeem (left) and Sumbul Siddiqui discussed their proposal to allow six-story buildings in Cambridge.\nErin Clark/Globe StaffHis natural approach as an engineer is to look at Cambridge\u2019s housing problem from an analytical perspective. The numbers bear out that Cambridge has too few homes for the number of people who want to live there, he said, and the city builds too slowly. Add the surge of well-paying biotech jobs over the last decade, and housing prices are going to explode.Azeem estimates he has spent, conservatively, hundreds of hours poring over the city\u2019s zoning code, and he\u2019ll happily discuss floor-area-ratio (a measure of a building\u2019s floor area in relation to the size of the land on which it sits) and other housing wonkery that quietly shapes cities. But he can expound, too, on big ideas, like why the country doesn\u2019t build big infrastructure projects anymore, and how Greater Boston would be better off with a much larger MBTA.Advertisement\u201cI get labeled as a dreamer because I look at issues like housing and transportation and suggest solutions that upend the status quo and get to the root of the problem,\u201d Azeem said. \u201cWell right now, the status quo is people spending half their income on housing, and a broken transportation system.\u201dEvery April 1 on social media platforms, Azeem proposes that Cambridge become \u201cMegaCambridge\u201d by absorbing Boston. Last year, he put up billboards advertising the idea, and this year, he introduced a formal resolution at the City Council. It\u2019s an April Fool\u2019s joke, he said, but the message behind it \u2014 that cities should think and function more as a broader region instead of individual municipalities \u2014 is serious.Related: The YIMBYs are coming, to the suburbsIt is the combination of those two worlds of thinking, about the intricacies of zoning and big vision for what a city should be, that inform Azeem\u2019s work on housing policy.\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about ideas on housing for years and years,\u201d said Councilor Marc McGovern. \u201cBurhan made sure we actually did something with those conversations.\u201dIn consecutive years, in 2022 and 2023, Azeem helped pass an ordinance that banned minimum parking requirements for new developments \u2014 lowering a major cost of new construction \u2014 and changes to the city\u2019s affordable housing overlay to ease approvals of affordable projects as tall as 12 to 15 stories in some sections of the city.Both of those proposals were controversial and passed the council by close margins. So when Azeem, along with councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, suggested the city allow buildings up to six stories tall on any lot, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in Cambridge and promoting dense housing in even lower-slung neighborhoods, it felt like a long shot. A few years prior, a similar proposal died in committee.Advertisement\u201cWhen I first started talking to him about this, I was incredibly impressed with his economic substance, and thought he was enormously ignorant politically,\u201d said Jason Furman, an influential Harvard economist and former adviser to President Barack Obama, whom Azeem consulted on the proposal. \u201cI saw a guy obsessed with his idea who had no idea of the political hurdles he had to pass.\u201dBut, Furman said, Azeem\u2019s penchant for big ideas hides his political calculus.\u201cClearly,\u201d he said, \u201cI was wrong.\u201dThe Sacred Heart Rectory at 49 6th Street in East Cambridge is the future site of an affordable housing development that will have no parking spaces.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, the pro-housing movement can occasionally be known for that sort of thing: big ideas, with too little political acumen to persuade everyday voters. But Azeem has been adept at allying with politically savvy councilors to help push his ideas forward.\u201cBurhan\u2019s superpower is that he is a regular person who is genuinely interested in connecting with the people he represents,\u201d said Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director of Abundant Housing, which Azeem helped found.And it may work in his favor that he can be shy and is not a Type A backslapper like many other politicians, said Kanson-Benanav, because it means he tends to prefer one-on-one conversations, which can endear him to people. At his election night party in 2023, he spent most of the evening in the corner chatting with a few people, even as the crowd of 20- and 30-somethings loudly cheered and celebrated his reelection.Related: Cambridge passes new affordable housing rules, paving the way for taller buildingsAdvertisementStill, his style and the scale of his ideas have rubbed some in town the wrong way.The Cambridge Citizens Coalition, a local group that advocates for slower growth, has frequently criticized Azeem, saying his policies are reckless and will mainly lead to the development of expensive condominiums instead of housing affordable for everyday people. Last year, after Azeem himself bought a small multifamily property near Fresh Pond, they accused him of potentially profiting from his own upzoning proposal, which would enable a much larger property there.The group declined to comment for this story.But that is the nature of debate over local housing policy these days. Discussions can be personal, because the issue is so personal for so many people.Azeem\u2019s response is to talk with as many people as he can. He knows not everyone will agree with his ideas, but that\u2019s not a reason to stop pushing for them. And sometimes it works. Like in February, when Azeem\u2019s six-story zoning plan passed the City Council 8-1.It\u2019s the sort of proposal that could get people voted out of office in a lot of places. But here, it paid off, and Cambridge may never look the same.\u201cI would be doing a disservice to the people that elected me if I didn\u2019t try to pass real solutions to our problems,\u201d said Azeem. \u201cThat\u2019s what politics should really be about, right?\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "subhead": "For those with disabilities, it starts with getting in and out of the house.",
        "content": "By  Megan Johnson, The Boston Globe\n\nAfter his neck was broken on April 30, 2021, when the Uber he was riding in crashed into a parked car in Somerville, Will Good had to learn to navigate life in a power wheelchair.\n\nNow paralyzed from the neck down, Good, 34, spent several months at Massachusetts General and Spaulding Rehabilitation hospitals to care for the spinal cord injury he suffered in the accident. When the time came for his release that September, the Somerville apartment where he previously lived wouldn\u2019t accommodate his needs. Good would have to learn to function in a world where the design scheme is generally inhospitable to those with disabilities.\n\nWhile more thanone in four American adultshas a disability, it\u2019s not just younger people like Good who face challenges in their homes\u2019 design. As baby boomers enter their retirement years, many will face issues that require accommodation. But with78 percent of baby boomersnationally planning to age in place, according to Redfin, their  homes likely aren\u2019t equipped to sustain them.\n\nOnly about10 percent of homesnationwide are fully prepared for senior living, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. No matter the resident\u2019s age, accessible homes are in great demand.\n\nEach year, Rick Castino, president ofOperation Independence, a home accessibility construction company based in Watertown, gets an increasing number of inquiries from people concerned about their home\u2019s accessibility.\n\n\u201cBy 2040 or 50, there\u2019s going to be a huge population of people over 65 who are going to be faced with staying in their house or not,\u201d said Castino. Some of the inquiries he receives are urgent, \u201cbecause we get a lot of folks who suddenly have a stroke, or they\u2019re in a car accident, or we do a fair amount with kids who were born with physical challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of the first concerns tackled should be getting in and out of the home, since most houses have front steps. Linda Merrill, a Duxbury-based interior designer, notes thatrampsneed 1 foot for 1 inch of elevation.\n\n\u201cIf your best access door is 30 inches off the ground, you need 30 feet of ramp,\u201d said Merrill, who educated herself on accessible design after her father had a stroke. \u201cYou need it to not be so steep that someone couldn\u2019t roll their wheelchair in.\u201d\n\nMerrill also notes that door jams need to be completely flat and threshold-free. Doorways, which can be particularly narrow in historic New England homes, often need to be widened beyond32 inches, according to the state\u2019s Architectural Access Board.\n\nThe bathroom is one of the most challenging spaces to navigate. Grab bars are helpful for fall prevention, and higher toilets make it easier to get up again. The installation of threshold-free or roll-in showers provides the ability to bathe.\n\n\u201cYou can roll right in. You don\u2019t trip. It\u2019s the most accessible way to bathe in a bathroom,\u201d said Castino, who notes that removing traditional bathtubs is one of his most frequent jobs.\n\nFor those returning from rehab or inpatient care, it\u2019s important to have a trained professional evaluate your home before your return. If you\u2019re tackling renovations now but aren\u2019t yet having mobility issues, Merrill said it is wise to get things done you\u2019ll likely need later. In a bathroom, installing extra blocking in the walls will allow grab bars to be put in easily later.\n\n\u201cIf you needed to install grab bars, you have something you can install them on. You don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s not an expensive thing to add, because it\u2019s just more wood,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cNobody thinks they\u2019re going to be in a wheelchair. But they might think, \u2018Well, I might be weak.\u2019 If you never need it, great. And if you do need it, it\u2019s less work to put in.\u201d\n\nOne of the most common issues is stairs. While some people can afford $40,000 home elevators, Castino noted that a stair lift is the most economical way to move between floors. However, they start around $4,000, and can be much more expensive for a curved staircase.\n\nBrian Harvey, owner ofHarvey Home Modificationsin Natick, noted that transitioning to single-floor living is a common alternative for homeowners looking to avoid stairs.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of houses in Newton and the Greater Boston area where there\u2019s not even a half bathroom on the first floor,\u201d said Harvey. \u201cFolks don\u2019t want to necessarily move out of their communities, because if they\u2019ve paid down their mortgage, there are no more affordable housing options.\u201d\n\nInstead, Harvey will take the existing first-floor space and make it completely self-sufficient with the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom all on the first floor. That also can free up space for someone to move in upstairs, if need be.\n\nTo minimize the risk of falling, hazards like floor rugs should be avoided. In some cases, slip-resistant flooring should be installed. Lighting modifications \u2014 such as installing enough bright white or daylight bulbs \u2014 help reduce glare for people with vision issues.\n\nGood moved into a two-bedroom unit across the hall from his aunt in South Boston. It was modified through the stateHome Modification Loan Program, which provides Massachusetts residents with disabilities or those who are over 60 with zero-interest loans for home modifications. The building was previously made more accessible due to Massachusetts\u201930 percent rule, which states that if renovations exceed 30 percent of the property\u2019s value, full accessibility requirements must be fulfilled.\n\n\nDoorways were widened to accommodate Good\u2019s wheelchair, and shelves were mounted onto the walls to clear up floor space. The tub was removed to create a wet room, and an overhead lift was installed in the bedroom to transfer Good from his wheelchair to the bed. He and his partner, Vita Brown, have filled the South Boston condo with their art and musical instruments. They painted the walls and put several pieces of their record collection on display.\n\n\u201cI like to say we\u2019ve made it move-in proof if you were just a regular person trying to buy a condo because it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s style,\u201d said Good. \u201cBut it\u2019s very much ours.\u201d\n\nMegan Johnson can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "The Big Apple just got bigger \u2014 at least when it comes to the price of this newly listed \u201cquadplex\u201d penthouse.\nOn Thursday, according to StreetEasy, this four-level nest listed at 111 W. 57th St. on Manhattan\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row \u2014 the building itself being the skinniest skyscraper on the planet and the second-tallest residential building in the United States.\nListed for $110 million, moreover, the grand unit is now the priciest for sale in New York City, StreetEasy additionally shows.\nEvery unit in 111 W. 57th St., also known as Steinway Tower, takes up at least one full floor, but Penthouse 80 at the tippy top takes up four.\nSteinway Tower is iconic for its lithe facade, which pierces the sky like a needle, but with a pinnacle whose design resembles a feather. It has a slenderness ratio of 1 to 24, meaning it\u2019s 24 times as tall as it is wide. That makes it the skinniest skyscraper in the world. For reference, the slenderness ratio of the Empire State Building is 1 to 3.\nThe dwelling spans 11,480 square feet over the 80th to 83rd floors, with 618 square feet of exterior terraces.\nThe lofty residence, the listing of which wasfirst reported by Bloomberg, boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and 14-foot ceilings. It currently includes five bedrooms and six full bathrooms.\nThe vacant condo\u2019s suggested floor plan was designed by Studio Sofield, but the $110 million asking price includes a full buildout and redesign, if an ultra-wealthy buyer so chooses.\nCurrently, the first floor \u2014 on the building\u2019s 80th story \u2014 includes a grand entry hall and a south-facing kitchen with access to an outdoor terrace.\nFour bedrooms take up the second floor, each with an ensuite bathroom, as well a lounge area and a wet bar.\nThe third floor is taken up by a 2,800-square-foot primary suite, which boasts two ensuite bathrooms \u2014 one clad in gray onyx and the other in white onyx. The final and fourth floor, the \u201ccrown suite,\u201d was made for lavish parties, with a bar, a private screening room, a service kitchen and an outdoor terrace.\nA quadplex in Manhattan is rare indeed. Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffinfamously snagged onein 2019 at nearby 220 Central Park South for roughly $238 million, making it the most expensive home ever sold in the US. That record remains to this day.\nLead listing brokerNikki Fieldof Sotheby\u2019s International Realty told Bloomberg that the Steinway Tower quadplex was originally two duplexes, but the decision was made to up the ante by combining them.\nPreviously, nearby Central Park Tower was home to the city\u2019s most expensive residences. One, a penthouse thatlisted for a breathtaking $250 millionin 2022, laterhad its price reducedto $195 million. The other, called \u201cSky House,\u201dasked $150 millionwhen it listed in 2024.\nToday, neither of them remain for sale, we hear. The former, according to StreetEasy, left the market in October 2024. The latter, the listings portal also shows, was taken off the market in March. (Extell, the developer behind Central Park Tower, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)\nSteinway Tower \u2014 developed by JDS Development Group, Property Markets Group and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance \u2014 has seen a spate of contract signings in recent months. Nikki Field\u2019s team at Sotheby\u2019s, which took over sales at the tower in the summer of 2024, takes the credit.\nIn the eight months since Field took over, the building has been rebranded, repriced and restaffed.\nField\u2019s efforts seem fruitful.The firm reported $187 million in deals currently under contract, with eight contracts so far this year. That includes Penthouse 72, which last listed for $56 million. Steinway Tower has 59 units.\nField, who helped sell Jeff Bezoshis penthouse at 212 Fifth Avenue, told The Post that she is looking for a similarly exceptional buyer for Penthouse 80.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Jeff Bezos 2.0 at 111,\u201d Field said.\nThis is all welcome news for the skyscraper, which opened its doors in 2022 aftera fraught construction process. Initial sales were sluggish and prices were reduced, even into last year.\nField told Bloomberg that Penthouse 80 was held back until sales proved strong enough to support the listing. It appears that the time was finally right \u2014 market reports and in-the-know brokers confirm that ultra-luxury sales in Manhattan are booming this year while supply remains low.\n\u201cThis very healthy luxury spring market,\u201d Field said. \u201cWe had no excuses to delay the launch.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A meticulously restored Georgian townhouse at 241 E. 48th St. has come up for sale \u2014 and beyond its many perks, it comes with coveted access to a rare oasis in Manhattan.\nPriced at $11.5 million, this 5,500-square-foot residence sits within the exclusive Turtle Bay Gardens, a historic enclave known for its lush, private communal garden \u2014 a lush hangout accessible only to the 20 surrounding homes.\nThe property, a five-story masterpiece with a finished cellar, boasts a recent Landmarks-approved renovation and modern luxuries like a smart home system and elevator access, all while preserving its turn-of-the-century charm.\nTurtle Bay Gardens, nestled between East 48th and 49th streets between Second and Third avenues, has long been a magnet for luminaries.\nIn 1920, Charlotte Hunnewell Sorchan transformed the area by acquiring adjacent lots and reimagining them as a cohesive community.\nShe enlisted architects to strip away the original facades, replacing them with elegant stucco, and cultivated a central garden filled with towering trees and pleasing shrubs. Today, the enclave remains a coveted retreat.\nThe townhouse itself is a standout. Its ground floor features a chef\u2019s kitchen with a waterfall island, a sun-drenched great room with 20-foot ceilings and a gas fireplace.\nThe parlor level offers a formal living room with a Juliet balcony and a built-in library, while the upper floors house a full-floor primary suite with a spa-like bathroom, two ensuite bedrooms, and a loft-style suite with a terrace overlooking the large garden.\nA cellar entertainment room, a gym and ample storage round out the offerings.\n\u201cOffered well below replacement value \u2014 estimated to save the new owner over $2 million in renovation costs \u2014 this is a true turnkey masterpiece,\u201d the listing says. The property is represented by Nikki Field and Matt Perceval, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nTurtle Bay Gardens has historically drawn a roster of cultural icons, includingKatharine Hepburn,Stephen Sondheim, and E.B. White, who penned \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d while residing on 48th Street.\nBut perhaps the garden enclave\u2019s most famous resident was Bob Dylan, who lived next door at 242 E. 49th St. for two decades, from the 1980s to 2005. That property, which is also one of the few that enjoys garden access,listed for $7.25 millionin December 2024. It entered into contract in February.\nDylan\u2019s tenure inTurtle Bay Gardensbegan when he rented the townhouse in the 1980s, later purchasing it in 1990 through a business associate.\nHe raised his young children there, drawn to the privacy the enclave afforded.\nHe eventually sold the home in 2005 for $4.45 million, and its recent listing coincided \u2014 purely by chance, the agent insists \u2014 with the theatrical release of the buzzy 2024 film about his life.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s creative legacy extends beyond Dylan. Hepburn lived at 244 E. 49th St., while Sondheim called the same address home for 60 years until his death in 2021; his property fetched $7 million in 2023.\nEven more recently, banker Olivier Sarkozy and child star Mary-Kate Olsenowned a double-wide townhouseat 226-228 E. 49th St., selling it for just over $10 million in 2024 after their divorce.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "With the promise of state grant funding and historic tax credits, developers are pitching their plans for a 68-room hotel with a retail space or restaurant on the ground floor",
        "content": "First they planned a hotel. Then condos. Then a hotel again.After nearly seven years and three failed redevelopment attempts, the owners of the long-empty Alexandra Hotel on the border of the South End and Roxbury are back with another proposal to revive the historic property.With the promise of state grant funding and historic tax credits \u2014 along interest from as-yet unnamed investors \u2014 developer Tom Calus said he and business partner Jas Bhogal expect this fourth proposal to be \u201cthe one.\u201d\u201cThis is one of the most beautiful buildings in Boston, arguably, and it really deserves to be restored, brought back to its original grandeur,\u201d Calus said.The building's historic facade. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe Victorian Gothic property, which dates to 1875, has seen a long stretch of unsuccessful redevelopment plays. In 2008, the Church of Scientology bought the dilapidated building for $4.5 million, planning a restoration that was to eventually house the church\u2019s local headquarters. That project proved expensive, and ultimately the Scientologists put the property back on the market for sale in late 2014. It spent nearly five years on the market, and at least one sale agreement fell through before Calus and Bhogal spent $11 million to buy the site in 2019.By that time, Calus and Bhogal had already been involved in the Alexandra Hotel for a year. In mid-2018, they pitched a facade restoration in front of a 150-room hotel; the Boston Planning and Development Agency later approved a 12-story project with a rooftop restaurant and deck.Advertisement\u201cDue to decades of neglect and extensive water infiltration, the existing structure is no longer viable and will accordingly be replaced,\u201d the BPDA said when approving the first redevelopment attempt.AdvertisementBut then came the COVID-19 pandemic, which clobbered the hospitality and tourism industry, and there wasn\u2019t much appetite for a new hotel. So Calus and Bhogal in mid-2021 came back to the city with a new plan: condominiums. A few months later, the BPDA approved 79 condos, including some compact units.Shortly after the approval, federal interest rates \u2014 which had long been near zero \u2014 began shooting up. Construction financing, which had been readily available for years, quickly became much more expensive and made projects harder to pencil out economically.Bhogal and Calus considered switching to apartments, but the hotel market had begun showing new signs of life. The pair reverted to their original plan: a hotel built behind a restored facade, a 13-story, 150-room structure with rooftop bar and restaurant. The BPDA board approved that $70 million project last May.\u201cConstruction costs were through the roof, and we weren\u2019t able to make the project work as a larger hotel,\u201d Calus said. \u201cSo we decided to rethink the project.\u201dA rendering of the ground floor, which would include either a retail store or a restaurant.EmbarcAmid the rethinking came a big stroke of good fortune: Governor Maura Healey\u2019s $3.5 billion economic development bill \u2014 signed into law in November \u2014 set aside some $6 million for the Alexandra\u2019s facade restoration. By reducing the project\u2019s size, the expected cost similarly declined. And if the developers kept the Alexandra standing, rather than tearing most of it down, the project could qualify for historic tax credits.The developers this week filed a fourth, and what they hope is final, redevelopment plan with the city that calls for restoring the historic Alexandra and building a five-story expansion on the vacant lot next door. The 68-room hotel would include retail or restaurant on the ground floor.AdvertisementA view of the empty lot next to former Alexandra Hotel where the addition is planned.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAn added bonus? Removing the \u201ccontroversial\u201d tower above the existing facade \u2014 long the subject of neighborhood ire \u2014 has renewed community excitement about a restoration, Calus said.\u201cMost people in the community, and Boston as a whole, really want to see this building restored the way it is, without having to add a tower,\u201d Calus said. \u201cWe like the scale of it. We like the design of the new building and how it connects with the old building. We\u2019re just happy to move this project along.\u201dThe project team has donated to community benefits, as many developers in Boston do. And an advisory meeting at the Boston Landmarks Commission saw an \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d response and a few minor design tweaks, said Marc LaCasse, an attorney representing the developers.\u201cThe big bone of contention in all the prior approvals was the height of the tower,\u201d LaCasse said. \u201cThe fact that the tower is gone \u2014 everyone says, \u2018We love it. ... When can you start?\u2018\u201dBob Minnocci, a board member of the Worcester Square Area Neighborhood Association, said several community members who had previously opposed the project due to the additional height were now fully in support. Minnocci, who himself lives a few doors down from the Alexandra, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d at the potential of something actually happening on the dilapidated property.\u201cIt\u2019s just been falling into greater disrepair as the years have gone on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a blight on the community \u2014 your eye just can\u2019t go further when you look at that blight. Now you\u2019re going to see a fresh, brand new project that\u2019s just going to be beautiful, cleaned up, and really be an important part of the gateway from this area.\u201dAdvertisementAt its smaller size, the project can move more quickly through the Planning Department\u2019s review. LaCasse said he expected the BPDA board to vote on the proposal as soon as next month, and then South End Landmarks Commission needs to give its final sign-off before work can begin.\u201cOur heart is attached to it at this point, so we want to take it through,\u201d Calus said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say there haven\u2019t been moments where we lost hope and faith. This new iteration feels right, and we\u2019re very happy with it, and we\u2019re excited for this, so it\u2019s kind of giving us some new energy. We\u2019re not giving up. This one\u2019s going to work. This one\u2019s the one.\u201dFaded architectural details of the building's exterior.David L.

        "subhead": "Plus, what to do when a woodpecker is making holes in your home.",
        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nAs a follow-up to my December 2024 column \u201cSmart planning for your 2025 home renovation,\u201c I wanted to expand on a concern that is becoming more and more common: How to accommodate the increasing need for electricity in our homes.\n\nWe are getting more calls from homeowners for heat pumps, car chargers, and HRV or ERV systems for in-home air quality as a result of tightening up insulation. To resolve many of these circumstances, we are increasing the electrical service capacity, which is typically the preferred approach. However, for any number of reasons, this is not always practical.\n\nAnother option for homeowners that I\u2019d like to explore is to install a load manager adjacent to your circuit panel.\n\nThese load managers can be set to shut down pre-determined nonessential circuits when the load on the panel reaches a certain level, typically 80 percent. At that point, circuits for items like washers and dryers, spas or pools, garage lighting, and door openers would be shut down. This would allow essentials like refrigerators, HVAC equipment, and other needs to be kept live without overloading the system.\n\nThe circuits chosen to be kept live or shut down can be customized for individual needs and are completely up to the owner. Most load managers can be controlled and monitored with your phone using an app, so they can also be changed at any time. They also are useful in tracking electrical usage in far greater detail, something that can be helpful as people try to conserve energy and save money.\n\nHome load managers can be integrated into any home electrical system, whether you have solar installed, battery backups, or generators. As always, it is advised to have a qualified electrician come in to evaluate your electrical service and balance that with your current needs and/or future requirements as you modernize your home.\n\nUltimately, this will be helpful for both your home budget and for the planet.\n\n\nQ.We have an 1880s Queen Anne cottage that has cedar clapboard on the first floor and cedar shakes on the second. We have no idea why a woodpecker would be drilling holes in our second-floor shakes, primarily on our turret. Periodically, we have contractors come out and fill the holes with putty and re-stain. They didn\u2019t see insects. What is going on, and what can we do to prevent this?\n\nJB\n\nA.This is more common that you might think: We have had other readers ask about this, and I\u2019ve worked with a client who had a woodpecker problem, too. Woodpeckers typically peck out holes in trees (or houses) for one of three reasons. They are after food or trying to store food; they may be trying to build a nest; or a male is trying to court a female. A male trying to find a mate will even peck into something just to make a racket and attract her attention. It could even be a metal chimney cap or roof vent, it doesn\u2019t always have to be wood. It is hard to say which of the three your particular woodpecker is doing.\n\nWhen we had the issue with a past client, the best recommendation we had was to hang reflective streamers in the windows near where the birds were wreaking havoc. It seemed to work. Looking at the photo you sent, streamers inside the second-story windows between the storm and the actual window may do the trick. If practical, an even better place for the reflective streamers would be outside, where the actual damage is occurring. Another source for info and/or solutions would be your localAudubon Society, where you will find bird experts who may have better insights. If possible, get a picture of the bird and the holes they are making. Good luck!\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

Standing in the foyer, there is a pair of double-doored closets on the right, one for the washer and dryer. The flooring here is hardwood.\n\n\nMoving directly ahead, first to arrive is the kitchen, which is snuggled into its own area through a doorway on the left.

The dining area is nicely placed in front of the tall windows and the view of the Seaport.\n\n\nReturning to the foyer and turning to the right, the hallway leads to the first of two bedrooms. For the secondary bedroom, the flooring changes to carpeting in the short hallway that hosts a closet on the left and a bathroom on the right. The full bath has tan stone tile flooring, a single vanity top, and a shower behind a clear glass door with a tile backsplash.\n\n\nThe secondary bedroom is 163 square feet and is sun-splashed from the floor-to-ceiling windows with six panes and thick metal framing.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The stock marketmay be down, but Manhattan\u2019s ultra-luxury residential market is looking better than it has since the pandemic.\nThat\u2019s the verdict according to market reports by New York City brokerages,compiled and reported by CNBC. Manhattan\u2019s ultra-high-end luxury real estate market \u2014 with properties priced north of $20 million \u2014 had its best first quarter in six years, according to a cited Compass report. Those with very deep pockets tend to buy units in all-cash deals; 58% of sales in the quarter were made in cash, with units priced above $3 million seeing 90% of sales from buyers coming in with cash.\nThose in-the-know on Manhattan\u2019s luxury market, like Keller Williams agent Nicole Gary, say that the uptick is impossible to ignore. After a quiet 2024, demand among ultra-high-net-worth clients is up.\n\u201cThings that have been sitting for a long time started to move,\u201d Gary, who leads the the Nicole Gary team at Keller Williams NYC, told The Post.\nGary said limited high-end inventory and clients\u2019 desire to move money from financial markets into real estate play heavily into the recent wave.\n\u201cPeople always feel that Manhattan real estate is a safe bet. It\u2019s a hedge against inflation, and it\u2019s a place where people feel safe when you know the stock market is volatile,\u201d Gary said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing over the past few months, is a little bit of volatility with the tariffs and everything that\u2019s going on politically. People are taking the opportunity to purchase these trophy units in Manhattan.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s overall market is showing early strength, as well. Closed Manhattan sales in the first quarter of 2025 exceeded last year\u2019s quarter one sales by nearly 29%, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. There were 2,560 closed sales in the quarter, up from 1,988 the year prior. The total value of apartment sales reached $5.7 billion, 56% over the same quarter in 2024.\nThat said, that\u2019s all been driven by the higher end of the market. Compass data shows that sales priced above $5 million jumped by 49% year-over-year.\nIt\u2019s a buyers market, even along Billionaires\u2019 Row, and the ultra-high-net-worth are taking the opportunity to upgrade.\nIncreasingly strict back-to-office mandates on Wall Street and beyond are also bringing high earners back into the Manhattan fold. CNBC\u2019s report also cited the \u201cgreat wealth transfer,\u201d the ongoing intergenerational transfer of trillions of dollars from the baby boomer generation to their fortunate offspring, as moving the real estate needle.\nBut the bullish numbers don\u2019t reflect the whole picture. Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, told CNBC that the first quarter of 2024 was atypically slow.\u00a0Instead, Miller is framing 2025 as \u201cthe year of getting back to normal,\u201d according to his report.\nWhat is clear, however, is that the luxury market is \u201ccarrying the team,\u201d this year. CNBC reported that mid-market sales \u2014 sales between $1 million and $3 million, have lagged.\n\u201cI think buyers in that range worry more than the ultra-high-net-worth clients,\u201d Gary told The Post. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling with \u2018Where\u2019s the economy going? Is this a good time to invest?\u2019\u201d\nBuyers interested in $10 million-plus or $20 million-plus condos typically own multiple homes, and they\u2019re often paying in cash, Gary said, so they are less risk-averse than your average hopeful homeowner.\nCompass\u2019s 2024 year-end report on the ultra-luxury market predicted an increasingly competitive market through 2025, particularly as the reality of low ultra-luxe inventory meets with a rising trend of ultra-exclusive private listings.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Homebuilders are responding to\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s new\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, and say that although the worst-case scenario was avoided, the new trade policy will inevitably raise the\u00a0cost to build homes.\nTrump on Wednesday announcedsweeping new tariffson most major trading partners,stunning Wall Streetand sending thestock market into a nosedive.\nCollectively, Trump\u2019s trade moves bring the effective tariff rate on all imports to around 26%, up from 2.3% before he took office, according to an assessment from Capital Economics.\n\u201cWhile the complexity of these reciprocal tariffs makes it hard to estimate the overall impact on housing, they will undoubtedly raise some construction costs,\u201d says\u00a0Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.\nA recentsurvey of homebuildersfound that they expect an average cost increase of $9,200 per home due to the recent tariffs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods that must be paid by the company receiving the imports.\nIf their construction costs rise, homebuilders could either try to pass the increase along to buyers or reduce their profit margins. Builder margins are\u00a0already under pressure, and if they are squeezed too much, construction activity could decline.\nNationally, the\u00a0median sales price for new single-family homes\u00a0was $414,500 in March, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\nWhile the new tariffs willincrease\u00a0construction costs for homebuilders, the majority of the U.S. housing market is made up of previously owned homes.\nIn March, about 18% of the homes listed for sale across the country were newly built, according to\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0data.\nHowever, new construction plays an outsized role in certain states\u2014and those are often places where housing is scarce and the need for additional housing is the strongest.\nIn Idaho, a whopping 40% of active listings on the market last month were new builds, the highest share of any state.\nBehind Idaho were North Carolina (33% new construction), Delaware (31%), Utah (28%), and Nebraska (28%).\n\u201cThe states at the top of this list are the ones doing the most to address the housing supply gap, but they are also the most at risk of being affected by tariffs,\u201d says Realtor.com senior economist\u00a0Joel Berner.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cThe cost associated with tariffs on building materials gets passed along to new-home buyers, which works against the progress builders have made in these states to grow housing inventory and make homeownership more attainable,\u201d he adds.\nImportantly, Trump\u2019s latest announcement contained a key exception that will limit the fallout for homebuilders, by continuing to exempt Canadian lumber from any new tariffs.\nThe NAHB estimates that 72% of imported lumber comes from Canada, making it a vital source of the key building material. Canadian lumber continues to face tariffs of 14.5%, which predate Trump\u2019s second term. So far, he has exempted lumber from any additional new duties.\nIn a statement, Hughes said the homebuilder trade group \u201cis pleased President Trump recognized the importance of critical construction inputs for housing\u201d by continuing to exempt lumber from any new tariffs.\nStill, the new tariffs could affect many imported construction inputs, ranging from appliances and fixtures made in Asia to flooring and countertops from South America.\nProduction that already shifted out of China in response to tariffs on that country during Trump\u2019s first term could now be subject to harsh new levies.\nFor example, industry experts say kitchen sink production has moved largely from China to Malaysia and Indonesia, countries whose exports to the U.S. will now be taxed at 24% and 32%, respectively. And goods still imported from China now face eye-watering tariffs of 54%.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s tariff announcement was a real whirlwind that has left the stock market reeling, but one of the few bright spots was that Canada and Mexico were largely left alone,\u201d says Berner.\n\u201cLumber from Canada and gypsum from Mexico are important inputs to American homebuilding, and while it would not be a surprise to see the White House target these imports again in the near future, the immediate threat of the tariff announcement on American builders appears to be less severe than it could have been,\u201d he adds.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire Meta titan, has been outed as the buyer of a $23 million residence in Washington, DC \u2014 a purchase that underscores a growing trend among tech execs securing a foothold in the nation\u2019s capital during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\nThe expansive property, located less than 15 minutes from the White House depending on traffic, also places Zuckerberg in walking distance toVice President JD Vance\u2019sofficial residence at the Naval Observatory.\nThe transaction, executed in March through a Delaware-based limited liability company in all cash, ranks as the third-most expensive home sale in the city\u2019s history, according toPolitico.\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the acquisition, stating to The Post: \u201cMark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.\u201d\nThe 15,400-square-foot brick mansion, designed by prominent local architect Robert M. Gurney, replaced a $5.15 million property demolished in 2013.\nThe new residence boasts five bedrooms and 7.5 baths, and features two kitchens and three fireplaces, according to development records obtained by The Post.\nExtensive outdoor amenities include a basketball court and a pool complex, fortified by newly constructed walls and fencing for enhanced security.\nNestled on a nearly 1-acre corner lot in the leafy Massachusetts Avenue Heights neighborhood of Northwest DC, the residence sits amid notable landmarks like the mighty Washington Cathedral and beautiful Embassy Row.\nThe residence aligns with the street\u2019s traditional aesthetic by hugging the road, freeing up ample private outdoor space and greenery at the back.\nThe dwelling comprises three distinct sections linked by glass-enclosed walkways, blending modern flair with classic gabled roofs, tall chimneys and steel windows.\nInside, these sections cater to both expansive communal areas and cozy family retreats.\nThe handsome exterior features durable brick and limestone walls, slate roofing, powder-coated steel windows and copper downspouts, selected to harmonize with the neighborhood while withstanding the elements.\nZuckerberg\u2019s move coincides with a wave of high-profile tech figures establishing a presence in Washington as the industry seeks to influence Trump\u2019s administration.\u00a0Others, meanwhile, have already been there for some time.\nDavid Sacks, Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency adviser, acquired a $10.3 million home in January, while Amazon founderJeff Bezospurchased a $23 million property in 2016. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel bought a $13 million residence in 2021, and former Google executive Eric Schmidt secured a $15 million mansion in 2024, previously a temporary home for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\nIn contrast, Elon Musk, a key presidential adviser, has eschewed a permanent DC address, opting to sleep in his office at the Executive Office Building and frequently accompanying Trump to Mar-a-Lago in Florida.\nThe timing of Zuckerberg\u2019s purchase raises eyebrows. He was seen at the White House on Wednesday, the same day reports surfaced of Musk\u2019s planned exit from government duties by late May, fueling speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s potential role as a tech confidant to Trump.\nYet, immediate challenges loom for the Meta chief. The company faces an antitrust trial in April, with the Federal Trade Commission weighing a breakup of its WhatsApp and Instagram holdings. A settlement with the administration could mitigate risks, though Trump may see political value in targeting a tech giant.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The tony Southampton estate at 623 Halsey Neck Lane, the cherished retreat of the late Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun and his wife, Mica, has slashed its asking price by nearly 35% \u2014 tumbling from $52 million to $34 million, The Post has learned.\nThe 11,000-square-foot Hamptons property, perched on 5.5 acres with 450 feet of Taylor Creek frontage, listed for that higher sum in March 2024 \u2014 its first availability since the Erteguns built it 35 years ago.\nAhmet, a music industry titan who propelled talents like Ray Charles and the Rolling Stones to stardom, died in 2006 at 83 after a backstage fall in Manhattan. Socialite and philanthropist Mica, who outlived him by almost 17 years, passed away at 97 in December 2023 at this East End property, one of four the couple owned around the world.\nThe residence features 10 bedrooms, 13.5 bathrooms, a staff wing and striking design elements like a towering pyramid-vaulted living room ceiling and a Palladian-inspired layout.\nAnd now, a deep-pocketed house hunter can buy it for less.\n\u201cThe price change really sort of came about as a result of having the house on the market for some period of time and realizing the buyer pool expectations given that the house, though is certainly in wonderful condition, is a house that was built 30 years ago,\u201d Tim Davis of Corcoran, one of the brokers representing the listing, told The Post.\n\u201cPeople may want to make changes to it and make some improvements to it. And we\u2019re seeing some very, very strong prices with houses that really don\u2019t require any work at all,\u201d Davis added. \u201cAnd those that do require some work, we are seeing that we\u2019re adjusting to the marketplace and getting a lot more action and offers.\u201d\nDavis said that since the price cut, the home has lured in several interested parties, including an individual who plans on bringing his architect to see what modern-day upgrades can be made.\n\u201cIf somebody was to buy this and spend $4 to $5 million renovating, that\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d Davis added. \u201cSomebody could probably still be in for July and August of this year, if they got into it right away, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on right now.\u201d\nFacing a conservation parcel once tied to the DuPont family \u2014 industrialists famed for their gunpowder fortune \u2014 the estate carries a whiff of Southampton\u2019s storied past.\n\u201cThese are sort of old-world, old-money names that were part of the history of Southampton in general. So to that, it has its own interest and the home itself is quite impressive,\u201d Davis previously told The Post.\nBeyond its grandeur, the couple\u2019s worldly d\u00e9cor kept inside this residence, and all their others,was the focusof a buzzy Christie\u2019s auction in late 2024. The sale comprised 636 lots from the Erteguns\u2019 collection \u2014 artworks, antique furniture and china \u2014 with about 230 lots originating from this East End dwelling.\nThe auction, according to the Christie\u2019s website, brought in a whopping $191.61 million in sales total across three November sales in New York and Paris. (It isn\u2019t clear if that figure includes fees.)\nSome of the prized pieces included the John Helion \u201cBande Verte\u201d painting from 1936, which was auctioned off for over $1 million \u2014 $300,000 more than it was initially expected to go for.\nA David Hockney painting from 1937, which portrayed three chairs with a section of a Picasso mural, went for $9.03 million \u2014 $3 million more than it was expected to fetch.\nBut the priciest in the auction, was a Rene Magritte painting from 1954, titled\u00a0\u201cL\u2019empire des lumi\u00e8res,\u201d which was auctioned off for a colossal $121.16 million \u2014 and set a new record as the most expensive surrealist artwork ever sold.\nThe mansion now sits vacant, its contents stripped away following the auction.\u00a0Proceeds from the auction and the home sale are both slated to go to charity.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been the only owners. I was sort of dreading this house being empty of furniture,\u201d Davis previously said. \u201cIn a way now, one can view the space and be part of that space and imagine themselves being there in their own way \u2014 without feeling like they need to honor what was once there.\u201d\nThe estate is co-listed with Harald Grant of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nAdvertisement",

Most recently, a businessman based in Australia, Ken He, had acquired it in 2014 with the intentions of building housing there. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, disrupting his plans. A lawyer for He, John G.F. Ruggieri, called the proposed sale to Mass Audubon an improper taking at a liquidation price; his client filed an appeal the next day. (In a statement, Mass Audubon says the owner had neglected the property and had plenty of time to line up a buyer.)Chelsea city officials had begun the process of seeking a court-appointed receiver to take control of the run-down property when a massive fire hit in November, disrupting travel on the commuter rail tracks that run along the site. The receiver then took over, with the help of a $400,000 loan from the city to cover her expenses. She petitioned Nestor to approve the sale, citing the site\u2019s deteriorating conditions.AdvertisementOn March 25, Nestor agreed to the deal.\u201cWhat is needed in this matter is a certain and soon outcome,\u201d Nestor wrote. \u201cThis offer will repay the taxpayers of Chelsea, clean up the property, and provide a reasonable development for the site. Defendants have had ample opportunity to suggest a viable opportunity but have failed to do so.\u201dFor Mass Audubon, the site would fit in well with its newer mission of developing green spaces in urban areas. Mass Audubon, GreenRoots, and their supporters have already raised the money for the purchase price, though president David O\u2019Neill said they would need to raise another $30 million to clean up the property and build a waterfront park and nature center. A portion of those funds would come from The Neighborhood Developers, a Chelsea-based affordable housing nonprofit that would buy a five-acre section of the property and build up to 225 units there. TND executive director Rafael Mares called it \u201ca transformative project\u201d that\u2019s \u201cworth the wait.\u201dHousing and land conservation, O\u2019Neill said, are often portrayed as conflicting uses.\u201cIn this instance, what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2018\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThis is an example of what can be done [with housing and conservation groups] working together.\u201dBut first the Mass Audubon team will need to get through He, who bought the property in 2014 for $11.6 million and remains its owner.Ruggieri, his lawyer, called the sale a \u201ccompletely ramrodded, behind-the-scenes deal.\u201d His client, he said, has poured millions into the property, mainly for permitting, since acquiring it and was fielding interest from potential buyers when the receiver took control and fired his broker. The offers, Ruggieri said, were for well above what Mass Audubon has agreed to pay.Advertisement\u201cThe owner of this property is absolutely apoplectic about this order,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cWe are very confident that the Appeals Court will not sanction [this] distressed sale. ... We\u2019re not enemies of the Audubon Society. However, they need to pay the proper price. They just can\u2019t take it clandestinely.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

        "subhead": "\u201cThe biggest misconception is that floods only happen in coastal areas \u2014 that it\u2019s only an issue for the Cape and the islands,\u201d one expert said.",
        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nDo you have flood insurance? If your home is located in a high-flood-risk area and you have a federally backed mortgage, you probably do because your lender would have required it. But what if you paid cash for your home? Or it\u2019s not located in a high-flood-risk area? You might still need flood insurance to protect what, for many, is their largest asset \u2014 your home.\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), more than 40% of claims through theNational Flood Insurance Program(NFIP) come from damage to homes located outside high-risk areas. In fact, not only is coverage available for less risky locations, but properties located in low-to-moderate risk areas may even qualify for a lower-cost Preferred Risk Policy, which provides protection at a more affordable cost.\nAccording to LendingTree, despite the fact that flooding is the most common and expensive natural disaster in the United States \u2014\u00a0with\u00a0an average payment per flood-insurance claim of $33,905 in 2024 through Nov. 30 \u2014\u00a0flood insurance enrollment fell between November 2023 and November 2024. Experts say that\u2019s because there are many myths about flood insurance.\n\u201cThe biggest misconception is that floods only happen in coastal areas \u2014 that it\u2019s only an issue for the Cape and the islands,\u201d saidBen Cavallo, a principal ofC&S Insurancein Mansfield. \u201cButLeominster had 11 inches of rain in one dayin 2023, and there was massive flooding even though it\u2019s nowhere near the water. You can be vulnerable to a flood even on a hill.\u201d\nThe City of Boston recognizes the risk of flooding with adedicated section on its websiteabout the risks. \u201cFlood is one of the most common and costly natural disasters,\u201d said Logan Grant, Boston\u2019s floodplain administrator. \u201cHowever, many homeowners and renters underestimate their risk.\u201d\nAnother common myth is that a homeowners policy will cover flood damage. Not so, Grant said \u2014 a separate flood insurance policy is recommended for those at risk.\nCheck with your insurance agent to find out whether it\u2019s advisable for you to have flood insurance and where to get it. Policies are available through the NFIP or through private companies, some of which are now adding flood coverage to an existing homeowners policy, Cavallo said, although that\u2019s primarily for companies that insure high-net-worth homeowners. You can also find a flood insurance provider atfloodsmart.gov/get-insured/flood-insurance-provider.\nAlthough you can select how much coverage you want,the NFIP limits building coverageto $250,000 and contents coverage to $100,000 for a one- to four-family structure. Excess flood insurance, with higher limits, is available from private companies.\nAccording to Cavallo, an NFIP policy on a hypothetical single-family home in a moderate-to-low flood-risk area of Bedford, with a limit of $250,000 for the dwelling and $100,000 for contents, would cost $434 per year. Compare that to the premium for an NFIP policy in the same amounts for a seasonal single-family home on the beach on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a special flood hazard area, which would cost $11,119 per year.\nCavallo recommends shopping around for the right flood product and price. Those concerned about the premiums they\u2019re quoted may want to raise the policy deductible and accept more risk themselves, which would lower the premium.\n\u201cYou\u2019re better off having a high deductible and some coverage than no coverage at all,\u201d he said.\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

The clip attracted over a million views, and the attention of the family who actually live there.\nThe \u201cGirvan Tower\u201d on Girvan Estate is believed to be the tallest private residence in the country and was built for the late Peter Grey over six years in the 1990s.\nAndrea and Andrew Evans bought the estate for $779,204 USD in 2012, which was reportedly significantly less than the house cost to build.\nThe family now run Vast Harvest Permaculture \u2013 a completely self-sustainable food forest and orchard \u2013 across 400 acres.\nJames Evans, 21, told news.com.au they had been reluctant to show off the 10-story house on their own social media because they wanted to keep the focus on permaculture, but when a stranger\u2019s video went viral, they changed their mind.\n\u201cEveryone was saying it\u2019s a hotel and this and that, so [I thought] I may as well clarify the facts,\u201d James said.\nAnother reason the Evans\u2019 were hesitant to do a full house tour before now was to avoid people making the assumption that a 10-story house meant the family was sitting back and living a life of luxury.\n\u201cWe\u2019re nothing fancy. I drive an old HiLux and even if I had the money to buy a Lamborghini I wouldn\u2019t, I would spend it on something that\u2019s beneficial for the community and all of us because that is what we believe in,\u201d James said.\nThe ground floor has the original red carpet, chandelier and pool, while the first floor, which is also treated as a \u201cstorage level,\u201d has some gym equipment and what was an outdoor tennis court.\nThe third floor is James\u2019 living area and bedroom, and the fourth floor is his younger brother Drew and his fiancee\u2019s space. Both James and Drew are renovating their own levels.\nThe fifth floor is where the family\u2019s kitchen is located, the sixth floor has the lounge room, as well as food storage, and the seventh floor is the parents\u2019 room. Level eight is the office and level nine (or the tenth story) is the rooftop with an \u201cobservation deck\u201d.\nThere are incredible views of surrounding farmland, all the way to Newcastle and the ocean on the horizon.\nWhile the 10-story building is not apartments like many assume, the second floor has been recently renovated with the intention of being listed as a short term holiday rental on Airbnb \u201cvery soon\u201d.\nThe Vast Harvest Permaculture business is not new to tourism. The family offer paid tours to visitors, including guided walks and tastings through the \u201cfood forest\u201d and a farm-to-table meal. They also run workshops that include building birdhouses, cultivating mushrooms, and learning the permaculture technique of building swales on contour.\nBut they are ready to expand their offering by opening up a floor in their house to guests, building two additional tiny houses for accommodation, and starting buggy and horseback rides \u2013 with the goal of reaching more people to educate on self-sufficient living and healthy eating.\nJames said the best part about the unusual house was getting their own space, given the family work and live together.\n\u201cMy dad is 60 and he works his butt off. I try and get him to go on holidays and he refuses to. He is like me, a homebody,\u201d James said.\n\u201cI think I left this 20-minute area once in the last four months and that was yesterday.\u201d\nJames says it\u2019s not the 10-story house but their 24 mile food forest that deserves the hype. It has jack fruit, the largest tree fruit, and 15 different varieties of mangoes.\n\u201cInstead of it [the forest] producing inedible plants, it\u2019s all edible plants. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t need human hands. It\u2019s basically the Garden of Eden or Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory because everything is edible that you see around you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSome things obviously do need to be cooked like elderberries and things like that but it is designed to be a living garden that looks after itself.\n\u201cWe let the bottom third of the fruit on the tree drop, we take the middle third, and the top third goes to the animals and the birds.\u201d\nThose animals are pigs, chickens and ducks. The family also mill their own timber on the property.\nJames plans to one day take over the farm and business, and never leave.\n\u201cI don\u2019t just want my kids here and my brother\u2019s kids here, I want my grandkids and great grandkids, all the kids here and build a future generation of sustainability,\u201d he said.\nThe full house tour is available on Vast Harvest Permaculture\u2019s YouTube channel.\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s according to a recent report by the apartment search website RentCafe, which measured early-2025 rental market competitiveness in 139 US markets, including Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\n\u201cFolks are staying longer in their apartments,\u201d said Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi Matrix, which provides data to RentCafe. \u201cInterest rates and the lack of supply of affordable housing is forcing that issue.\u201d\nAverage stays range from 38 months, or just over three years, in Manhattan, all the way up to an impressive 51 months, or 4.25 years, in Queens.\nThe average renter in Brooklyn is staying 42 months, or 3.5 years, according to the report.\nThe data from which the findings were pulled encompasses January, February and March, but prime renting season is just heating up. Renters can expect a more frantic environment in thecutthroat environment of late summer, when a majority of renters renew their leases or find a new apartment.\nThe data gives clearer insight into one of the many reasons that the Big Apple\u2019s rental market remains challenging. Increased bidding warshave been documentedin pockets across the city.\nWith demand high and supply low, compounded by an increasingly uncertain economy, New Yorkers are feeling anything but restless.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a housing gap, and it\u2019s taken over a decade to create that gap,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be solved in the near term. So people are going to be renting longer.\u201d\nFirst-time homebuyers areolder than ever before, according to the National Association of Realtors. More would-be homeowners, who might otherwise make room for more renters by trading in a lease for a deed, are sticking to renting in the face of high mortgage rates and unaffordable home prices.\nRegardless of supply changes or demand shifts, this is still New York City. When a renter finds The One, they don\u2019t let it go. And besides, New Yorkers tend to get attached to their block, Ressler said.\n\u201cCommunity evolves around these housing cohorts, especially in urban cores. It really becomes quite prominent,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cThey [renters] want to be able to go get the pizza where they always go.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

At the time, the 2006 deal for the Upper East Side\u2019s Harkness House \u2014 a $53 million transaction \u2014 still held the crown.\nUltimately, Rubenstein saw the residence bounce on and off the market until 2022, whenit entered contractfor \u201cnearly\u201d $50 million, according to reports at the time. City records now show the limestone property traded hands for $48 million that September \u2014 with the buyer, now its seller, listed as an anonymous LLC.\nIn the years following Rubenstein\u2019s $84.5 million listing, an Upper East Side townhouse at 14-16 E. 67th St. traded hands in 2019 for $77.1 million, according to Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel.

What\u2019s more, there\u2019s also a formal dining room whose view corridor extends to the Pierre Hotel, according to the listing.\nMost notably, a relic from Rubenstein\u2019s residency remains: a billiards room that\u2019s lined with Herm\u00e8s-leather walls.\nIt\u2019s all capped by a roof terrace, accessible via an elevator, with views of Central Park, as well as a lounge and dining area below a cedar pergola. The lower level, meanwhile, has a wine cellar, a skylighted gym, a new sauna and a steam room.

        "content": "This hollowed-out shell of a landmarked Manhattan theater just got its big break.\nThe long-shuttered Metro Theater finally sold on Friday to the nonprofit Upper West Side Cinema Center, thanks to a big boost from the governor and a star-studded list of supporters. The New York Times firstreported on the successful sale.\nUpper West Side Cinema Center formed in 2024, spearheaded by Ira Deutchman and Adeline Monzier, and in November signed an ambitious agreementto buy the 10,260-square-foot buildingfor $6.9 million in cash by Jan. 10, 2025.\nThe endeavor enjoyed initial fundraising upwards of $2.5 million anda gaggle of famous friends, including Martin Scorsese, Ethan Hawke and Tim Blake Nelson, the latter of whom serves on its board of directors.\nDespite hundreds of donations ahead of the January deadline, the $6.9 million needed was out of reach. Then, the governor stepped in.\nWith encouragement from Assemblyman Micha Lasher, Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a $3.5 million grant. That boost, paired with $500,000 from the State Senate, earned the nonprofit a deadline extension.\nThe government support, buoyed by 400-some individual donations and a hefty grant from Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg\u2019s Hearthland Foundation, carried the sale past the finish line on Friday.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been involved in a project that had so many reasons for people to be cheering,\u201d Deutchman told The Post.\nThe Art Deco theater at 2626 Broadway entertained Upper West Siders with movie magic for nearly three quarters of a century before its previous owner shut its doors in 2005,citing untenable competitionwith megaplex movie theaters.\nAlbert Bialek, who purchased the property in the 1980s, gutted its interiors and struggled to lease the boarded-up building until his death in 2023.\nThe indie film-focused nonprofit aims to reinvent Metro Theater into a state-of-the-art five-screen cinema with education programs and a bistro.\nDeutchman said the neighborhood has long been a \u201ccinema desert,\u201d in need of a home for Upper West Siders to enjoy international and independent films.\nBroadway could also use the boost, Deutchman said. The Upper West Side\u2019s busiest commercial corridor was hit hard by pandemic-induced retail vacancies. Deutchman hopes the theater, located on Broadway near West 99th Street, will draw more pedestrian traffic and retail interest to the area.\nBut Deutchman and Monzier\u2019s dreams of lighting up the Metro Theater marquee once more are going to take a little more dough. The nonprofit has started up a capital campaign to the tune of $20 million to construct a new interior and make cosmetic enhancements to the iconic pink terracotta exterior.\nDeutchman told The Post that a small chunk of that $20 million has already been raised, so some improvements can get started.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been joking about the thing that the timeline is somewhere between two and 20 years, but in reality, what I hope is to try to get this done within three years,\u201d Deutchman said.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Lower prices on buildings mean lower prices for tenants, which could bring a wave of activity and energy to long-dormant buildings.",
        "content": "By Catherine Carlock, The Boston Globe\n\nThe old Barnes & Noble in Downtown Crossing has sat vacant for nearly two decades. It\u2019s a historic building on a corridor of Washington Street that\u2019s both bustling with pedestrians anddotted with vacancy signs. Out front, there\u2019s a payphone that still crackles when picked up anda piece of street artdesigned to spark renewed vitality into downtown.\n\nNow, 399 Washington has new life, in the form of new owners, who bought it at a bargain-basement price.\n\nEarlier this month, Boston-based Hudson Group and Assembly Investments of New York closed on their purchase of the retail and office building for $13 million \u2014 80 percent less than its prior sale in 2017. That sort of discount portends a difficult future ahead for Boston\u2019s budget,which is largely reliant on property taxes. But, as new owners Noam Ron and Evan Oscar Papanastasiou expect, it also means they can lower rents to the point where they can actually attract a tenant to abuilding where the ground floor hasbeen empty since 2006.\n\n\n399 Washington was family-owned for decades, until 2017 when Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management and L3 Capital bought it for $63 million. They then invested millions more into a full suite of upgrades: working bathrooms and elevators, new mechanical and HVAC systems. They stripped off the two-story gray slab that hung over the building\u2019s entrance for years, replacing it with tall expanses of metal and glass windows. The owners started marketing the retail space shortly after buying the building, and completed upgrades in 2021.\n\nBut tenants never came. And earlier this year, with office demand still weak following the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and no rental income coming in \u2014 399 Washingtonended up in a real-estate owned sale.\n\nThe prospect of a freshly overhauled building at a big discount drew interest from several investors \u2014 includingCeltics star Jaylen Brown\u2014 but thebid by Hudson and Assembly won. Now they plan tomarket the property at rents in the $40s per square foot, $7 to $10 less than the typical rent for Class B office space downtown, and around $20 less than what the prior owners would have had to charge, Papanastasiou said. Bringing in a ground-floor retailer, and resetting rents for offices up above, will bring an energy to the property that hasn\u2019t been seen in decades, the new owners said.\n\n\u201cThat will cast a wide net for tenancy,\u201d Papanastasiou said. \u201cJust lighting up this building is going to help tremendously.\u201d\n\n\nRon and Papanastasiou aren\u2019t alone. Amid abroad post-COVID reset in office valuesacross the city that has long-reluctant owners resigning themselves to selling at a loss, investors and developers are spying opportunity, eager to snap up well-located spaces \u2014 and then offer them to tenants at lower rents.\n\nOne such opportunistic investor is Broder, a Boston-based real estate investment and development firm that recently bought 15 Broad St. downtown. It\u2019s Broder\u2019s second time owning the building, which it sold to Brookfield Properties in 2016 for $32.5 million. In late 2019, just a few months before COVID hit Boston, Brookfield sold it to TA Realty for $46.1 million. Earlier this year, Broder bought it back, for $13.5 million \u2014 $5 million less than it first paid to buy it 18 years ago.\n\nBroder is privately funded with family wealth, and its portfolio has little debt, said managing partner Eric Svenson. (His and brother Ben Svenson\u2019s father, John Svenson,passed from cancer in 2007and was a prominent Boston real estate developer, philanthropist, and co-owner of the Boston Celtics.) TA\u2019s underwriting was reasonable when it bought the property, Svenson said, but the market shifts since are inescapable.\n\nThese days, groups that bought buildings prior to the pandemic and with a five- or seven-year mortgage find themselves withlittle option but to sell for a loss. That means opportunity for firms like his; Svenson said he\u2019d like to make several similar acquisitions this year.\n\n\u201cA lot of sellers are feeling like it\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we had ten times the available capital we have. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for three decades and I\u2019ve never seen opportunities like this.\u201d\n\nProperties like 15 Broad St. and 399 Washington St. that have changed hands for significant discounts can give landlords flexibility to offer tenants space for a discount, or invest in modern amenities \u2014 a crucial factor in today\u2019s leasing landscape, said Wil Catlin, a senior partner with Boston Realty Advisors. But these days, Catlin noted,many tenants consider offices more an asset than a requirement, and they prize amenities and places for employees to connect with peers. So while pricing is important, it\u2019s not the only consideration.\n\n\n\u201cThe question is pricingfor what?\u201dCatlin said. \u201cFor a lack of a better term, it\u2019s got to feel good. You\u2019ve got to want to be there. If the owner is saying they get a $7 per square foot discount, and the employees and staff are not getting a differential experience, they\u2019re like: \u2018Uh, why are we here again?\u2018\u201d\n\nCatlin and other experts expect more deals like this as sales activity increases this year after a long slow period since COVID-19. Some of those sales will come as deep-pocketed global real estate owners pivot away from commercial real estate in an effort to curb future losses.\n\nPrivate equity behemoth Blackstone in 2023 told the Globe it would continue to pare back its office holdings. It paid around $156 million in January 2020 for a five-story brick-and-beam office at 179 Lincoln St. Last March, Blackstone handed both the building \u2014 and its $76.5 million in mortgage debt \u2014 over to Synergy Investments, according to Suffolk County records.\n\nMeanwhile Swiss bank UBS Group has been shedding office properties across the United States. In September, a UBS arm sold 400 Atlantic Ave., a six-story brick office facing Boston Harbor, for $30 million to the development arm of French financier Jacques Chahine, Suffolk County records show.\n\nThat\u2019s 40 percent less than the $50 million UBS paid to buy 400 Atlantic in 2014, and followedthe departure of long-term tenantGoulston & Storrs. Chahine Investment Corp. plans to convert the office to a hotel and restaurant, which would newly open to hotel customers a deck facing Boston Harbor that had been private for over 40 years, attorney Jared Eigerman wrote in a January letter of intent to the city\u2019s Planning Department.\n\nOver in Downtown Crossing, Papanastasiou and Ron said they\u2019re already in advanced conversations with several retailers to lease 399 Washington\u2019sexpansive first and second floor, which are connected by a striking brass staircase \u2014 a remnant of the Barnes & Noble days. They aim to sign an office lease soon for one of the upper floors. A fully built out office suite on the fourth floor, for example, is ready for a tenant any day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident we can lease that to an office tenant this year,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe\u2019re bullish on the future of downtown, and on this building.\u201d\n\n\nBe civil.

They\u2019re the current sellers \u2014 and the pair undertook a full, and opulent, remodel of the property.\n\u201cThe interior has been entirely transformed to this new white, black and gold, shiny, gaudy masterpiece,\u201d Compass agent Alessandro Corona told The Post.\nThe couple preserved Stamos\u2019 original design of the Mediterranean facade but gutted the \u201cvery \u201990s\u201d interiors, Corona said. He said the couple spent upwards of $3 million on the renovations.\nThe main living space features beautifully bookmatched panda marble, a two-sided fireplace and a massive crystal chandelier. Each of the seven bathrooms is sheathed in a different kind of marble, Corona said \u2014 and every toilet is clad in gold.\nIn addition to the luxe additions, Stamos\u2019 former recording studio was converted into an office, and a glam room designed for professional hair and makeup was added in the home\u2019s primary wing.\nCandace Aguilera is the CEO of the cosmetics brand Appeal and the daughter of Jeffrey Stanley, the founder of a large California bail agency, Bad Boys Bail Bonds. Her husband Justin has been linked to the family business as well, and unsuccessfully ran for election to represent California\u2019s 19th Congressional District as a Republican in 2018 and 2020.\nStamos sold the house in 2001 for $2.15 million after residing there for almost a decade, according to property records.\nThe Aguileras purchased the abode for $2.96 million in 2020, according to Zillow, and listed it for a rent of $50,000 in 2024 before putting it on the market this year.\nThe 6-acre property also includes a pool with stunning mountain views, multiple travertine terraces and, the listing notes, room for a helicopter pad. The estate also includes a detached guest suite with a private entrance.\nCorona anticipates that the listing will attract someone with celebrity status, with a need to live near Los Angeles.\n\u201cMost likely someone that would be looking for some level of seclusion and privacy,\u201d Corona said. \u201cIn addition to that, probably someone who has a flair for opulence.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "What time is it? The perfect time for someone to buy this standout Tribeca penthouse \u2014 one that\u2019s housed inside a historic, and stunning, clocktower.\nSeven years after Elad Group kicked off sales at 108 Leonard, the developer is unveiling the building\u2019s most coveted gem: \u201cThe Clock Tower\u201d penthouse.\nPriced at $19.25 million, this marquee residence \u2014 unit PHW \u2014 listed on Tuesday, marking its first time ever for sale.\nFor years, whispers about the mysterious triplex have swirled among New York\u2019s real estate elite \u2014 until now.\nThe penthouse\u2019s sprawling 8,770-square-foot interior is paired with 3,082 square feet of outdoor space \u2014 some of which directly surrounds the clock itself. It\u2019s all perched at the nexus of the building\u2019s north, west and south corners.\nHowever, the clock\u2019s immediate space, according to the floor plans, is very small \u2014 with no room to be habitable. The clock can be accessed via an antique spiral stair, should the owner want to admire its interior.\nUntil the building\u2019s redevelopment into residential units, the clocktower had been one of the few still functioning in the city \u2014 and one that was run purely by mechanical means. It was later electrified in 2023.\nInside, the triplex with ceilings soaring past 15 feet gives way to a dramatic spiral staircase that ascends into the clocktower.\nThe listing arrives at a pivotal moment for 108 Leonard. Just last week, the building\u2019s \u201cCrown Penthouse\u201d fetched $24.5 million, capping a bustling first quarter that saw seven contracts inked.\nMarch alone stood out, logging the highest number of sponsor deals above $20 million in New York City since September 2021, according to Marketproof data.\nWith fully built, move-in-ready condos in short supply \u2014 and uncertainty looming over construction costs amid potential tariff hikes \u2014 the timing couldn\u2019t be more opportune.\u00a0And now, it\u2019s time for this aerie to have its very first owner.\nAs Elena Sarkissian, the sales director for 108 Leonard with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve never listed it. This is the first time that it\u2019s on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe library is magnificent,\u201d Sarkissian added of the 16th-floor salon, which opens to the clock\u2019s turret, she likens to Batman\u2019s Gotham City. \u201cYou\u2019ll never make it again, you\u2019ll never see it again. It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s just so special.\u201d\nThe unit is made up of  five bedrooms, five full bathrooms and two full powder rooms.\nFor Elyse Leff, Elad Group\u2019s executive vice president of marketing and sales, the penthouse transcends typical real estate.\n\u201c\u2019The Clock Tower\u2019 penthouse is the crown jewel of 108 Leonard \u2014 a rare and magnificent residence that could never be replicated,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to own a McKim, Mead & White masterpiece in Tribeca and to live in a defining piece of the downtown skyline,\u201d she added, mentioning the famed architectural firm whose worldly designsdefined the pinnacleof Gilded Age New York.\nIndeed, the residence beckons a particular kind of buyer \u2014 one who cherishes history, architecture and the irreplaceable.\n\u201cNot just your everyday buyer,\u201d Sarkissian added, \u201cbut someone who really appreciates the provenance of this building and this particular residence.\u201d\nThe tale of 108 Leonard begins in the late 19th century, when it rose as the New York Life Insurance Company\u2019s headquarters, formerly 346 Broadway.\nDesigned by the legendary firm McKim, Mead & White \u2014 architects behind landmarks like the original Penn Station \u2014 the edifice was completed in phases. The eastern wing, started in 1894 under Stephen Decatur Hatch, was finished by McKim, Mead & White after Hatch\u2019s death in 1895. The western section, crowned by the three-story clocktower, followed between 1896 and 1898.\n(Architect Sam White, the great-grandson of the firm\u2019s final name, Stanford White, told The Post the building also notably stands out for its steel frame \u2014 a material that East Coast architects were slow to adopt, likely due its high cost.)\nThe clocktower looms over Broadway \u2014 its four 12-foot-diameter faces crafted by the E. Howard Watch and Clock Company, and adorned with Roman numerals.\nOnce, a colossal 33-foot sculpture by Philip Martiny \u2014 an octet of crouching Atlas figures cradling a hollow globe and an eagle \u2014 topped the tower. Though removed after 1928 and lost to time, the structure\u2019s ornate details, including hand-carved eagles and gargoyles lining its terrace balustrade, remain.\nBy 1987, the building earned New York City landmark status, celebrated for what the fifth edition of The A.I.A. Guide to New York City calls \u201cits wonderful Classical clock overlooking Broadway.\u201d\nIn 2013, developers the Peebles Corporation and Elad Group acquired the property from the Bloomberg mayoral administration for $160 million, embarking on a six-year transformation of the 19th-century palace into 152 condominiums.\nFor architect Tim Rooney, a partner at Jeffrey Beers International, which also had a hand in the building\u2019s look, this project was a rare privilege.\n\u201cThe whole building itself is really just a pleasure as a designer to work on,\u201d he told\u00a0The Post. \u201cHaving this really, kind of great building that you just don\u2019t find in Manhattan.\u201d\nThe goal was to create a space that feels timeless, despite its history of keeping time.\n\u201cThe idea was to take something historical and modernize it so it felt that it would be space that was handed down from generation to generation,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cAnd really, this was sort of the current generation\u2019s imprint on the space.\u201d\nInside the penthouse, a grand entry foyer spills into a 34-by-33-foot corner room, where a double-sided fireplace complements massive arched windows and ceilings topping 15 feet.\nThe primary suite, a 1,000-square-foot retreat, boasts a midnight bar, a windowed dressing room and a bathroom with a six-foot tub and a double shower clad in Calacatta black marble.\nUpstairs, a flexible suite of rooms invites customization \u2014 a wellness haven with a steam shower or sauna, perhaps, or a wine cellar.\nThe ascent to the clock tower\u2019s salon is the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\n\u201cMy first time in the clocktower itself, inside the actual space, was magical,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cIt is like being transported back in time.\u201d\nSurrounded by a 2,000-square-foot wraparound terrace, the pedestal level of the clock offers sweeping vistas \u2014 the Chrysler and Empire State buildings, the Hudson River, the close-by Woolworth Building and beyond.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the terrace,\u201d Sarkissian says, \u201cyou pick up the rivers on both sides. I mean it\u2019s really spectacular.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the main space and then as you make your way up the space, it becomes a little bit smaller, but your sort of on this secret journey on your way to the clock tower itself,\u201d he said.\nThis is no common penthouse.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one very lucky buyer ahead,\u201d Sarkissian\u00a0 said.\nAdvertisement",

The former party pad, located in Marylebone, asks $7 million.\nJagger was able to lease the space in 1966 thanks to the runaway success of \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\u201d and \u201cGet Off My Cloud.\u201d\nThe 2,495-square-foot residence is also where Jagger began his highly publicized relationship with singer Marianne Faithfull \u2014 and where he and bandmate Keith Richards threw famously heavy parties, according to Jagger\u2019s biographer Chris Salewicz in the book \u201cMick & Keith: Parallel Lines.\u201d\nThe four-bedroom home features 10-foot ceilings, parquet flooring, French windows and a balcony that runs the entire width of the apartment, according to the listing brokerages Beauchamp Estates and Prime London.\nThe apartment includes two reception rooms, a home cinema and a library. A large bay window brings light into the large primary bedroom; its ensuite bath has stone walls and a freestanding tub.\nListing photos show an understated home with clean lines and simple fixtures \u2014\u00a0highly incompatible with the vision of a \u201960s rock star\u2019s party-filled crash pad. Jagger\u2019s brief residence saw swarms of photographers visit in 1967, after it was rumored that he took LSD, and served as the backdrop for now-iconic photoshoots by Gered Mankowitz.\nThe Stones went on to release \u201cPaint it Black\u201d and other hits during Jagger\u2019s tenure at the apartment, which ended in 1968 when Jagger and Faithfull moved to an apartment in Belgravia. The pair split up in 1970.\nThe spacious residence is located inside a landmarked Edwardian mansion, called Harley House, built between 1903 and 1904 to house Irish migrants\u00a0working as servants for their wealthy neighbors.\nThe listing brokerages say this offering will lure in a specific kind of interest.\n\u201cWe anticipate the listing will attract significant interest from discerning buyers and fans of The Rolling Stones from around the world,\u201d said Jeremy Gee, the managing director of Beauchamp Estates, in a statement.\nAdvertisement",

Considering that the median sales price of a single-family home in Greater Boston was $883,000 in February 2025 \u2014 up almost 13 percent year-over-year, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors \u2014 many wannabe move-up buyers are finding themselves stuck at home.Patrick Hope invested $130,000 to put a 500-square-foot addition onto his home, creating two more bedrooms so his sons could have their own rooms - and privacy. Patrick Hope\u201cHome prices are only getting more expensive, and the [mortgage] rates haven\u2019t dropped, so a lot of homeowners are trapped,\u201d said Morgan Franklin, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Realty in Boston. \u201cThey might be younger couples who maybe went from one child to two or three, and they now need more space.\u201dAdvertisementLuckily, there are relatively low-cost improvements that can make a big difference in your home \u2014 to refresh it, make it more livable, and enhance your enjoyment of the space until the time comes \u2014 if it does \u2014 to move into a larger place.Patrick Hope, 45, purchased a two-bedroom, one-and-one-half-bath home in Medway in August 2012, paying $270,000 and financing it with a 3.5 percent mortgage. At first, Hope\u2019s two sons were sharing a bedroom. As they got older, the boys needed more privacy.Patrick Hope purchased a two-bedroom home in Medway in August 2012.Patrick HopeHope considered moving, but interest rates and prices had risen substantially in surrounding neighborhoods. So, Hope invested $130,000 into improving his 1,291-square-foot home, building a 500-square-foot addition with two additional bedrooms. He also replaced the roof and siding.Advertisement\u201cIt allowed for personal space for the kids, which freed up some of the downstairs living space,\u201d said Hope, who works in product marketing for a tech company. \u201cI don\u2019t see the market changing any time soon, so I built the house I wanted instead of buying something else.\u201dJasmine Edo, 34, lives in a 950-square-foot condominium in Revere on the second floor of the building, but would like to have a backyard for her dog to enjoy. She purchased her home in September 2020 for $285,000, but due to the high housing costs and her 3.5 percent mortgage rate, she felt stuck.\u201cMy only option was to make the place more livable, to upgrade,\u201d said Edo, a wealth planner.Jasmine Edo would like more space and a backyard, but at today's high Boston housing prices, she can't afford to either rent or pay a mortgage on a larger place. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffShe invested about $5,000 to repaint, replace a sliding glass door, upgrade the electrical system, and replace ceiling fans and light fixtures. Now she\u2019s saving for larger projects, like new floors and a new kitchen and bathroom.\u201cYou just have to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to enjoy the space you live in, so whatever you need to do to make it better for you, just make it happen.\u201dLee Bardin, owner of Expert Renovation Team in Newton, said there are many projects homeowners can make to create more usable space if they are stuck in a small home.Finishing a basement, for example, typically costs $20,000 to $25,000, he said. Due to code requirements, he recommends using that space as a home office or gym, not a bedroom.Converting a porch into a finished den would typically run $25,000 to $30,000, he said, and minor updates to a kitchen, such as cabinet refacing ($8,000), new quartz countertops ($5,000), and a tile backsplash ($2,500) could significantly enhance the room.AdvertisementJasmine Edo has done some minor home improvement projects, such as interior painting, replacing a sliding glass door, painting a deck, and installing new lights and a ceiling fan. Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\u201cConsider taking out the wall between the kitchen and the dining room or living room to have more flowing space,\u201d said Bardin of a project that would cost about $12,000.One of the least expensive improvements he recommends is painting, which can transform a room. Costs typically run $600 to $800 per room for walls, $400 for ceilings, and $500 for trim and doors, he said.",

        "content": "It was almost midnight when the smoke detector went off again. Angel Santiago expected his new home to have some quirks: It was built in Salem in 1812. But he\u2019d failed to uncover why the attic smoke detector continued to beep in the absence of smoke. A recent first-time home buyer, he headed upstairs and unscrewed the device.\u201cOh my gosh, [it was] just full of ants,\u201d he said.As insects and their eggs cascaded to the floor, Santiago shuttled the alarm outside, an early lesson in homeownership underway. He learned that ants nesting in smoke alarms can trigger the device. It would be the first of many lessons.For some first-time homeowners, year one can serve as a crash course \u2014 from finance to maintenance to design \u2014 following an already complex purchase process. The barriers are high, and those who manage to do it are fewer than ever. The market share of first-time home buyers sunk to a historic low of 24 percent in 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).AdvertisementOnce in a new home, experts say there are some first-year moves that homeowners can make to set them up for short- and long-term success. You can start before the keys are in hand.\u201cThe ones I get most worried about are the folks that are taking every dime they have and putting it into just getting the house,\u201d said Elliot Schmiedl, director of home ownership with the Massachusetts Housing Partnership (MHP). \u201cThey have very few reserves available to them after they close, because you never know when the boiler is going to break, or the roof springs a leak, or the sewer pipe gets clogged, and these things are increasingly more and more expensive.\u201dAdvertisementMany home-buying courses are aimed at pre-purchase education, but MHP also facilitates HomeSafe post-purchase classes designed to support stability.Angel Santiago and his wife, Jordan, are first-time home buyers who were able to purchase the home on the left in Salem. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffGeorge Koutsos, a mortgage loan officer with CrossCountry Mortgage, counsels clients to keep three months of mortgage payments on hand for emergencies (and ideally, six). Staying in touch with lenders can alert owners to future drops in interest rates. For long-term security, consider establishing a trust, and it\u2019s never too early to draft a will, said Koutsos.Understanding which public resources may help in the early days can ease startup costs, said Jin Min Lee, homeownership and counseling program manager for the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation. Lee was a home buyer education student in that program before taking on her management role.In the early days of home ownership, self-advocacy is key, said Lee.\u201cI do feel like there\u2019s this kind of posture of\u2026 curiosity and humility and persistence that\u2019s required through the purchase process and also your first year,\u201d said Lee. \u201cBecause most of us just don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know \u2026 It\u2019s okay to ask questions, it\u2019s okay to really be persistent, and where there\u2019s one closed door, I\u2019m gonna find another door that\u2019s open.\u201dScheduling a Mass Save home energy audit is one example of a great early resource, said Lee, as is applying for resident tax rates for the new address, which can save hundreds if not thousands of dollars.AdvertisementNew homeowners can be attractive targets for sales pitches, and knowing how to navigate them will help.\u201cI think everybody who buys a home is going to quickly get started getting solicited,\u201d said Schmiedl.Instead of rushing into potentially costly improvement projects, slow down.\u201cLive in it for a year,\u201d said Schmiedl.A historical marker hangs on the front of Angel and Jordan Santiago\u2019s home in Salem. Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffRushing design changes can interfere with function before owners get a chance to live in the home.Allison Tilly Carswell and Andrea Canty, of Red Door Design + Staging, suggested pausing before rushing toward trendy upgrades, such as recessed lighting and open floor plans. Recessed lighting is really best used to illuminate the path in hallways, or to light a kitchen work area. Lamps are more configurable elsewhere.\u201cWe\u2019ve walked into a space and said something like, \u2018You might enjoy your home more if there [was] a wall here separating the entryway from your living room,\u2019 and the homeowners say, \u2018Oh, we took that wall down,\u2018\u201d said Carswell.To figure out a design that fits your lifestyle, prioritize heavily used rooms first, said Canty. And paint can go a long way to refresh previous renovations that may not match your tastes, such as on cabinetry.\u201cDon\u2019t try and fill the house right away,\u201d said Robin Gannon, a Lexington-based designer with national clientele. Live with what you have in order to help you assess the flow and use of a space before investing in higher-quality pieces. In week one, that won\u2019t be clear.\u201cYou\u2019re buying somebody else\u2019s taste,\u201d said Gannon.Spend some time reflecting on your own style, she said. A few quality placeholders can help along the way, such as Sisal rugs to unify a room. Try a bold wall color. And in a year, you can always repaint.Advertisement\u201cDon\u2019t listen to your friends \u2014 listen to your gut,\u201d said Gannon.Social media and AI design schemes can intrude on taste. Algorithmic churn can be self-reinforcing, as it spits out more examples like what you\u2019ve already looked for, said Gannon.\u201cI always say, you can like something but not necessarily want to live with it,\u201d she said.To break that cycle, Gannon suggested cross-referencing magazines and different manufacturers rather than following a social media rabbit hole.It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed in the first year of homeownership.\u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in this house that\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d said Santiago, who said he has made an effort to do his own repairs when possible, saving hundreds on smaller projects. He was quickly able to swap out the smoke detectors and manage the ants himself.\u201cIf you break it down and do one thing at a time, it\u2019s very manageable,\u201d he said.Santiago paid $656,500 for the three-story, two-family home with town house-style units (front and back), which he said helped qualify for the loan. A first-generation homeowner in his family, he saw gaps in home buyer education, which he said didn\u2019t address post-move issues. Santiago has since acquired his own real estate license with the hope of providing a different experience for others.Establishing a home in the first year can mean more than new boilers and bathroom renovations.\u201cHome is a home, but it\u2019s part of [a] community as well,\u201d said Schmiedl. \u201cA lot of good can come from that.\u201dAs Santiago began work on his home\u2019s exterior, he discovered several bottles and silverware items dating back to the 1850s. But the project turned up more than artifacts.Advertisement\u201cFrom all the hours and hours and hours of work\u2026 I met all of our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s gonna be on the other side. \u201cMaybe you meet somebody new, or maybe you find a cool bottle.\u201dLindsay Crudele can be reached at lcrudele@gmail.com.",

Today, Millinocket is up and coming as a four-season tourist attraction. The gateway to Mount Katahdin, Maine\u2019s highest mountain, Moosehead Lake, and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, the town exemplifies Vacationland.

One of these is East Longmeadow, situated in the Pioneer Valley between Springfield and the towns of northern Connecticut. East Longmeadow was once a center of red and brown sandstone quarrying: the stone making up the original building of Washington\u2019s Smithsonian Institution museum is from here. The Elijah Burt House, built between 1720 and 1740, is worth a visit. It is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the town, and a station on the Underground Railroad.Center Barnstead, N.H.AdvertisementNew Hampshire real estate prices have been rising, but the occasional quality home for under $400,000 still exists. An area to search is Center Barnstead, a community in the town of Barnstead and the largest of several villages in the town. It is close to the Lakes Region, which has convenient access to the hundreds of lakes south of the White Mountains. There you will find ski areas, art galleries, beaches, restaurants, ice cream shops, and all the other destinations vacationers seek, but with rural tranquility and scenic beauty.AdvertisementA resort in New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains region. Julia TiltonEastport, MaineFor good reason, the coast of Maine is a magnet for vacationers. With its countless harbors, coves, headlands, beaches, and islands, it is unparalleled for scenic beauty, fresh air, and fresh lobster. But, as with any desirable area, it is pricey, with houses in coastal towns fetching far more than inland real estate.This changes as you leave behind the crowds of the mid-coast and head Down East to Washington County. At the end of the road, at the Canadian border, is Eastport. With just a little over 1,000 people, it is the least-populous city in Maine, but also one of its most historic: Eastport celebrated its bicentennial in 1998.It is one of the most festival-minded communities in Maine. Navy ships have docked here during the Fourth of July celebration for many years. Every September, the city hosts the annual Maine Salmon Festival in the historic downtown district, and, for 20 years, there has been a Pirate Festival the weekend after Labor Day.Wardsboro, Vt.Vermont has maple syrup, great cheese, legendary ski mountains, picture-perfect villages, and cows grazing on hillsides unspoiled by billboards or strip malls. In the southern part of the state, between Mount Snow and Stratton Mountain in the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forest, is Wardsboro.This small town encompasses five villages, one of which literally has the name Podunk. Wardsboro has scenic beauty and recreational opportunities \u2014 Somerset Reservoir and Grout Pond are minutes from Main Street, and the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers Snowmobile trails run through the town \u2014 but none of the crowds and condos of nearby ski areas.AdvertisementEustis, MaineHunters, hikers, nature lovers, and those who simply want to get away from it all head to the pine-scented peace of Maine\u2019s western mountains. Eustis, which includes the village of Stratton, is located about halfway between Sugarloaf Mountain and the Canadian border. It is on the Dead River, which provided transportation for Benedict Arnold and his troops in 1775, when they made their way to fight in the ill-fated Battle of Quebec. Later, the river was known for log drives, which involved floating wood down the river to mills, a deadly practice that was banned in 1976. Now the Dead River is a popular destination for white-water rafting.",

Those buyers should take a different approach to renovating.\u201cThe equity builder looks for the tired house where the owner prioritized substance over style,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can transform dated kitchens and baths without gut renovations using smart refreshes: new appliances, countertops, and strategic paint choices. Remember: the moment you fall in love with the project is the moment your profit margin starts shrinking.\u201dAdvertisementFor the dream creators, it\u2019s different.

That means there is a lot of wear-and-tear and inevitable repairs to consider tackling. When is it time to stay, and when is it time to go when dealing with drafty windows, a cracked foundation, or other signs of \u2014 shall we say, maturity?Cracks in the foundation will be an expensive fix.\n\n Amy Newman/Globe File Photo\u201cThe current market is tough for first-time buyers,\u201d said Eric Sugrue, a Redfin Boston agent. \u201cThe inventory of available houses to buy has never been lower in our market. Most buyers realize they will have to compromise.\u201dBuy a home warranty or negotiate one from the seller to provide peace of mind that at least all of the mechanicals are covered, Sugrue said, before emphasizing that buyers remember the acronym PEACH: Plumbing, Electrical, Air Conditioning, and Heating.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the aesthetic design aspects when touring a home, but it\u2019s important that buyers \u2014 and especially first-time buyers \u2014 focus more on the things that either they can\u2019t change or can cost them a lot of money down the road,\u201d added Amanda Pendleton, a Zillow home trends expert.Location and layout are hard to change, so if you aren\u2019t satisfied with those, it might be best to find another home. But nice-to-have things like a chef\u2019s kitchen are easier to add down the line. Buyers should look for signs of pests and structural damage: Visible water damage, uneven floorboards, and gaps in windows or doors can be a sign of problems becoming bigger issues if they aren\u2019t fixed, Pendleton said.AdvertisementWhile all of those interviewed for this story emphasized the importance of working with experienced real estate agents and conducting a full home inspection for true peace of mind, they also noted there\u2019s no one-issue-applies-to-all when it comes to home buying.\u201cThat is a very challenging question to answer, because it\u2019s so much about personal preference,\u201d said Sarah Gustafson, president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cEach house is unique, and it\u2019s unique to the buyer who is buying.

        "hed": "Can accessory dwelling units ease the Cape\u2019s housing crisis?",
        "subhead": "",
        "content": "When Jayne O\u2019Brien lost her husband Bill suddenly in March 2024, she faced two difficult challenges. While dealing with shock and grief, she also wondered where she would live. The couple had been living in Bill\u2019s home in Eastham during their five-year marriage, but after his death, his daughter inherited the house.O\u2019Brien, 71, still owned a home in nearby Brewster, which she\u2019d been renting to her son and his girlfriend. Her son promptly offered to move out, but O\u2019Brien declined.A friend put O\u2019Brien in touch with a Maine-based company called Backyard ADUs, which builds accessory dwelling units. Defined as a secondary residential living space located on the same lot as a single-family home, an ADU can be a freestanding structure or a unit attached to the primary home. They\u2019ve caught on as an affordable way to address housing shortages in states from California to Maine. O\u2019Brien\u2019s son was immediately on board with building one.This 740-square-foot model unit in Cotuit features one bedroom, one bathroom, an open-concept living room, and a flexible bonus room.Backyard ADUsAdvertisement\u201cWe talked a lot about how to do this and still preserve independence and privacy for both of us,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.ADUs are poised for expansion on Cape Cod: The Affordable Homes Act, which went into effect on Feb. 2, now requires municipalities to permit the building of ADUs in single-family zoning districts throughout Massachusetts, relieving a range of zoning challenges that prevented people from building ADUs across the state.ADU growth will be especially beneficial in places like the Cape, where the cost of housing \u2014 and renovating \u2014 is prohibitively expensive. The annual median sales price of a single-family home in Barnstable County increased from $433,000 in 2019 to $730,000 in 2023, according to the Cape Cod Commission, an organization that works to address the region\u2019s housing crisis and develop innovative land use policies.Advertisement\u201cAccessory dwelling units are one of the many tools that we can employ to develop more affordable housing options,\u201d explained Kristy Senatori, executive director of the commission. \u201cThey\u2019re not a panacea, but it is relatively easy to add units or density to an existing neighborhood through the use of ADUs while maintaining the architectural character of the area. Certainly that\u2019s critical to Cape Cod\u2019s identity and our economy on the Cape.\u201dIn addition to serving as homes for aging relatives, ADUs also can support the Cape\u2019s year-round population by providing a source of rental income.\u201cOur clients are definitely interested in it, both buyers and sellers,\u201d said Katie Clancy, sales vice president at William Raveis Real Estate in Yarmouth Port. \u201cLenders are seizing the opportunity, too, by letting borrowers use potential ADU income count in the mortgage apps.\u201dTim O\u2019Reilly, director of preconstruction for Backyard ADUs, says the majority of their business is building 500 to-1,200 square-foot homes for multigenerational living.\u201cWe\u2019re often designing with an aging in place lens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had folks who said \u2018Hey, I built this for my adult son with disabilities, or for my mom.\u2019 Or \u2018Hey, I could rent this out for several years and pay down my costs, then move my family in.\u2018\u201dO\u2019Reilly emphasized the range of success stories. \u201cIt\u2019s about having that flexibility \u2014 it\u2019s in my backyard, and now I can do what makes the most sense,\u201d he said.AdvertisementNow, O\u2019Brien is a few weeks out from moving into a 642-square-foot abode in her backyard. As a self-described outdoors person, she isn\u2019t concerned about the limited living space, as she relishes her large deck, outdoor shower, and sizable yard for gardening.\u201cI do feel like [my son] and I are the poster family for the necessity and benefits of zoning that allows for ADUs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an affordable option and one that will enhance my property now and in the future.\u201d",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "For decades, people have bought property with a partner or their biological family members. But amid a skyrocketing housing market and loneliness becoming a public health epidemic, aspiring buyers are looking beyond the traditional nuclear family to find new financial and social solutions to homeownership.At the end of April, Harvard Law School plans to release a landmark guidebook called \u201cHow to Buy Property with Chosen Family,\u201d which addresses how to approach traditional institutions such as banks and real estate agencies as a nontraditional unit. The first-of-its-kind primer, which will be published by the school\u2019s LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic, is for people trying to buy a home with friends or anyone hoping to live in a nonstandard structure.The arrangement is often associated with polyamory, but the clinic emphasizes that the guide can apply to a group of friends, multiple families, or anybody who wants to break into the housing market but doesn\u2019t have the desire or resources to go it alone. The guide offers strategies such as creating a tenancy in common agreement or an LLC, which offers ownership agreements and stipulates financial consequences in case a living arrangement goes south.\u201cAmong a lot of people I know, this is the main way that they see themselves being able to [buy] \u2014 and it also seems like a much better idea than becoming isolated in your own little suburban enclave without access to community,\u201d said Samara Trilling, a third-year Harvard Law student who coauthored the guidebook in collaboration with the Polyamory Legal Advocacy Coalition (PLAC).AdvertisementThe guide comes at the right time, Trilling said, as more people simply crave community and homeownership. The structure \u2014 romantic or platonic \u2014 makes financial sense, and the guide\u2019s release coincides with a shift in household demographics. As of 2025, an estimated 61 million Americans (nearly 20 percent of the population) co-own a home with someone who isn\u2019t their spouse, according to a new survey by CoBuy, an end-to-end platform to simplify nontraditional home buying.Advertisement\u201cMany people are not in a nuclear family. That is just not the state of American families anymore. ... And cities are sort of having to grapple with: Wait a second. If that\u2019s not actually reflecting our constituents, how do we build in pathways toward generational wealth that actually can meet people where they\u2019re at?\u201d said Kimberly Rhoten, a PLAC cofounder.Somerville is a groundbreaking example. In 2020, spurred by COVID and the desire for all people to easily visit loved ones in the hospital, the City Council passed an ordinance recognizing domestic partnerships, including polyamorous relationships. Somerville again made news in 2023 when the City Council approved a unique anti-discrimination ordinance to protect people in polyamorous and other consensually nonmonogamous relationships. The ordinance prohibits discrimination in employment and policing against those in relationships of two or more people.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from people who moved to our community specifically because of these [2023] laws and because of the domestic partnership ordinance that passed in 2020,\u201d said Willie Burnley Jr., a Somerville city councilor-at-large and mayoral candidate who is polyamorous and rents his home with platonic roommates.Somerville City Councilor-at-Large Willie Burnley Jr. outside The Burren, which he said might be torn down for a high-rise housing complex. John Tlumacki/Globe StaffPLAC has done similar work in Cambridge, and the progress has been logistically helpful to home buyers \u2014 but also symbolic to people who often feel stigmatized due to lifestyle choices, proponents said.AdvertisementHeath Schechinger, another PLAC cofounder and executive director of the nationwide Modern Family Institute, enjoyed lower utility costs and a bigger home than he would have otherwise afforded while living with two other couples. Of course, the arrangement wasn\u2019t perfect.\u201cI didn\u2019t have this unilateral capacity to make decisions on my own or that I thought would be best,\u201d Schechinger said. \u201cAlso, there was some social stigma.\u201dBut the benefits were worth it, and Schechinger is hopeful that laws and housing models will catch up to prospective homeowners\u2019 financial and social realities.\u201cAn increasing number of people are living with their chosen family: buying homes with friends or partners, or building family through shared values rather than marriage. The future of family isn\u2019t about form. It\u2019s about function \u2014 and who you build your life with.\u201dKara Baskin can be reached at kara.baskin@globe.com. Follow her @kcbaskin.",

Melvin Vieira, a real estate broker and former head of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, equated buyers going into home sales without an agent to someone going to court without an attorney, but added that the agent needed to be reliable.Proper agents can prevent a buyer from being misled during the sale, and can help them avoid pitfalls like shoddy home inspections and unscrupulous lenders, among other things.Advertisement\u201cBuyer\u2019s agents work with the buyer\u2019s attorney to make sure, among many other things, that the title is clear and the lender is reputable,\u201dVieira said.The new law, which went into effect in August 2024, said home buyers must engage \u2014 at their expense \u2014 a broker looking out for their best interests. Before, the seller was in effect paying part of the buyer agent\u2019s fee.Sandrine Deschaux, who\u2019s been selling real estate in Greater Boston for two decades, estimates the fee ranges from 2.5 percent to 3 percent of the final property price.\u201cYou can structure the agreement as you want. You can make it an a la carte deal,\u201d she said.Deschaux said the agent and buyer work together to find the right product.Advertisement\u201cThe agent must assess your tolerance for risk-taking.

        "subhead": "What sparked the FIRE movement?",
        "content": "In a world where avocado toast and side hustles have come to define\u00a0financial discourse\u00a0for younger generations,\u00a0Gen Z\u00a0is reshaping the conversation entirely.\nInstead of working their way up the corporate ladder or banking on a pension that may never materialize, many are turning to a radical new goal:retiring\u00a0by 40.\nThe strategy behind this ambition is the FIRE movement, short for \u201cfinancial independence, retire early.\u201d Popularized on social media platforms, FIRE proselytizes with a simple but strict philosophy: Embrace extreme frugality now to unlock early retirement later.\nFor a generation that came of age amid a pandemic,\u00a0record-highstudent debt, a volatile job market, and an uncertain housing future, FIRE offers something refreshingly hopeful: control.\nBut as more Gen Zers chase early retirement, one big question lingers: Can they alsoafford to own a home?\nThe FIRE philosophy dates back to the mid-1990s andYour Money or Your Life, the influential book by\u00a0Vicki Robin\u00a0and\u00a0Joe Dominguez.\u00a0The authors called for a radical rethink of money and time, urging readers to live simply, question consumer culture, and define success on their own terms.\nAt its heart, FIRE isn\u2019t just about money. It\u2019s equal parts self-help and personal-finance advice, challenging the cultural norm of tying identity to consumption and encouraging intentional, values-driven living instead.\nFor Gen Z, that message has struck a chord. On platforms likeRedditandTikTok, #FIRE content often includes budget breakdowns, DIY money hacks, and ultrafrugal meals\u2014like creator\u00a0Mia McGrath\u2019s famous50p eggs, which cost just 65 cents per serving.\nFor many Gen Zers, homeownershipfeels increasingly out of reach. Despite having\u00a0more saved\u00a0than their elder millennial counterparts, just\u00a018% of Gen Z owns a home\u2014largely due to record-high prices, rising interest rates, and stagnant wages. That creates tension with FIRE\u2019s core tenets: low expenses and high savings.\n\u201cOne of the main drawbacks to the FIRE movement is that it can be difficult for people to achieve the level of financial management they need to be able to retire early,\u201d says\u00a0Liz Hunter, commercial director atMoney Expert.\n\u201cIf you have a mortgage to pay, for example, you need to be able to make sure you can keep up with your repayments while you\u2019re budgeting.\u201d\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nLet\u2019s break it down.\nFIRE recommends saving 50% to 75% of your income at a minimum. Common wisdom recommends spending no more than\u00a030% of your income on housing.\nTo afford the\u00a0monthly mortgage\u00a0on a median-priced U.S. home of $420,000, while living off half of their income and spending no more than 30% of that on housing, a FIRE homebuyer would need to earn at least $209,000 a year\u2014a salary few 20-somethings command.\nSo, can Gen Z FIRE followers still buy a home?\n\u201cNever say never,\u201d says\u00a0Emily Zekonis, finance expert (and Gen Zer herself) fromRaisin. \u201cTo do both at the same time is probably out of reach for most people but, for example, if you live in a very low cost-of-living area but are making a large salary, you may be able to fill both buckets at the same time.\u201d\nMore realistically, most young adults will have to choose between FIRE and homeownership. Or, at the very least, compromise on one to make space for the other. That might mean saving a little less aggressively in favor of buying a home \u2014 or opting for a smaller property in a more affordable market.\n\u201cLike most things, restriction is great in moderation,\u201d Zekonis adds.\n\u201cThe discipline you need tosave up for buying a home(or pursuing FIRE) is required to get you where you want to be. But it can be easy to get carried away, and there\u2019s a distinction between discipline and deprivation. If home ownership is important to you, it\u2019s certainly OK to prioritize this goal and orient your finances in support of that.\u201d\nFIRE offers Gen Z a powerful vision: financial freedom, early retirement, and a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around a nine-to-five. That focus on independence is reshaping the American dream, trading the high-cost mortgage and white picket fence for a more flexible, and often more affordable, rent check.\nStill, Gen Z isn\u2019t shying away from hard financial choices. They\u2019re simply rewriting the rules. Whether that means renting forever and retiring early, buying a home and working longer, or finding a middle ground, one thing\u2019s clear: This generation is more intentional than ever about how they spend, save, and plan for the future.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "This Soho apartment rocks \u2014 so much so that grunge music queen Courtney Love once owned it.\nNow, the Hole frontwoman\u2019s former lair has listed for $9.49 million, The Post has learned.\nLocated at 30 Crosby St., the property offers a rare glimpse intothe new grandmother\u2019sNew York chapter, whichbegan in 2001when she traded Beverly Hills for Manhattan.\nLove, the 60-year-old widow of Nirvana icon Kurt Cobain, acquired the unfinished loft in 2001 for $2.64 million, becoming its first owner following a condo conversion from a manufacturing building.\nThe move came seven years following Cobain\u2019s 1994 suicide, and marked a significant shift from her West Coast roots.\nLove, a California native, had previously lived in a four-bedroom Beverly Hills estate, purchased in 1997 from comedian Ellen DeGeneres for $3 million. That property, which she renovated to include a gym, sat on 2 acres and featured a cement pond. Love listed it for just under $4 million before heading east.\nThis Soho loft, spanning 4,123 square feet, boasts three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nLove held the property until 2006, when financial pressures forced a sale.\nPublic records indicate she parted ways with it for $5 million, unable to keep pace with the mortgage.\nLove\u2019s departure from New York in 2006 marked her return to the West Coast, but in later years she still had a bit of New York presence. A2011 Vanity Fair profileby Nancy Jo Sales detailed Love residing in a West Village townhouse at 27 Bank St. for $27,000 per month \u2014 one that she filled with cupcakes, even though she declared she had only $894 in the bank \u2014 where she had allegedly done $100,000 in interior damages, according to court documents.\nThe unit\u2019s current owner is Stefan Sonnenfeld, a titan in the film industry known for revolutionizing digital color grading.\nSonnenfeld, who paid $7.07 million for the loft in 2012, has been dubbed the \u201cda Vinci of the movies\u201d for his work on blockbusters like \u201cPirates of the Caribbean,\u201d \u201cTransformers\u201d and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d As a co-founder of Company 3, he pioneered the digital intermediate process, reshaping how Hollywood crafts its visual stories.\nThe listing paints a vivid picture of the space, with a seeming nod to Love: \u201ca sprawling pre-war condo loft that exudes rockstar energy and downtown sophistication,\u201d it says.\nIt highlights a private elevator opening to a foyer that flows into a grand living area, drenched in light from oversize industrial windows.\nExposed brick, wooden columns, a gas fireplace and towering ceilings blend the building\u2019s 1890s origins with modern polish.\nThe kitchen, designed for entertaining, features dual Sub-Zero refrigerators, a wine cooler, double ovens and a vented cooktop.\nThe primary suite offers a vast dressing room and a spa-inspired bathroom, complete with double sinks, a soaking tub and a separate shower. Additional perks include a laundry room and ample storage.\nHoly Sose, Katie Johnson and Sabine Modeste of the Corcoran Group hold the listing.\nBuilt in 1890, 30 Crosby stands as a seven-story landmark with just 13 residences. Amenities include round-the-clock doorman service and a wine room.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Buyers in these southern US cities are spoiled for choice.\nSpring is ahot time for the real estate market, and these sweltering cities have a lot to offer. While high prices and elevated mortgage costs have put off buyers across the country, some markets in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana have further lagged thanks to surplus housing stock and sluggish listings.\nLong spells on the market and widespread price cuts may indicate that some once-eager buyers are turning away from life in these cities. If you\u2019re not, though, it\u2019s time to head south.\nThese five southern cities \u2014 Miami, Jackson, Tampa, New Orleans and Memphis \u2014 all landed on Zillow\u2019s\u201cbest metro areas for buyers\u201dlist based on the balance of sale-supply and demand in these markets.\nThe Daily Mailfirst reportedon the data.\nInterested buyers flocked to Florida cities like Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa during the pandemic, and eager developers followed. Housing largely kept up with demand, but the excess stock has turned these once red-hot locales into buyers\u2019 markets.\nBuyers in Miami can be leisurely, and not just because of the sun and sand. Homes are staying on the market for a median of 60 days \u2014\u00a0nearly three times longer than the rest of the country. A quarter of Miami listings also got price reductions in February, Zillow reported.\nJacksonville, the birthplace of Southern rock, boasts 22 miles of white sand beaches and plentiful price cuts. Nearly 30% of home sellers dropped their prices in February, and inventory was up more than 26% year-over-year.\nIn Tampa, inventory was 19.8% higher than it was compared to the same period last year. Nearly one-third for for-sale homes in Tampa took a price cut in February, as well.\nMeanwhile, populations have recently been on the decline in both Memphis and New Orleans.\nNew Orleans, known for its vibrant nightlife and delicious cuisine, has significantly more homes on the market today than before the pandemic, according to Zillow \u2014 42% more. The average home in New Orleans stayed on the market for a median of 58 days as of February, giving buyers greater bargaining power.\nBuyers in Memphis, a highly affordable city with a rich musical history, save more money with a mortgage than a lease, Zillow reported. The typical mortgage payment \u2014 20% down, 30-year fixed \u2014 is $1,228, while typical rents in the Tennessee city hover around $1,400.\nBut, as the Daily Mail reported, the sluggish uptake of so much inventory isn\u2019t simply due to extra homes and high prices. Once-frenzied buyers may be removing their rose colored glasses and contending with the issues of severe weather, flooding, crime and poverty in these metros.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By  Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nIt was almost midnight when the smoke detector went off again. Angel Santiago expected his new home to have some quirks: It was built in Salem in 1812. But he\u2019d failed to uncover why the attic smoke detector continued to beep in the absence of smoke. A recent first-time home buyer, he headed upstairs and unscrewed the device.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, [it was] just full of ants,\u201d he said.\n\nAs insects and their eggs cascaded to the floor, Santiago shuttled the alarm outside, an early lesson in homeownership underway. He learned that ants nesting in smoke alarms can trigger the device. It would be the first of many lessons.\n\nFor some first-time homeowners, year one can serve as a crash course \u2014 from finance to maintenance to design \u2014 following an already complex purchase process. The barriers are high, and those who manage to do it are fewer than ever. The market share of first-time home buyers sunk to a historic low of 24 percent in 2024, according to theNational Association of Realtors(NAR).\n\n\n\nOnce in a new home, experts say there are some first-year moves that homeowners can make to set them up for short- and long-term success. You can start before the keys are in hand.\n\n\u201cThe ones I get most worried about are the folks that are taking every dime they have and putting it into just getting the house,\u201d said Elliot Schmiedl, director of home ownership with theMassachusetts Housing Partnership(MHP). \u201cThey have very few reserves available to them after they close, because you never know when the boiler is going to break, or the roof springs a leak, or the sewer pipe gets clogged, and these things are increasingly more and more expensive.\u201d\n\nMany home-buying courses are aimed at pre-purchase education, but MHP also facilitatesHomeSafepost-purchase classes designed to support stability.\n\n\nGeorge Koutsos, a mortgage loan officer withCrossCountry Mortgage, counsels clients to keep three months of mortgage payments on hand for emergencies (and ideally, six). Staying in touch with lenders can alert owners to future drops in interest rates. For long-term security, consider establishing a trust, and it\u2019s never too early to draft a will, said Koutsos.\n\nUnderstanding which public resources may help in the early days can ease startup costs, said Jin Min Lee, homeownership and counseling program manager for theAllston Brighton Community Development Corporation. Lee was a home buyer education student in that program before taking on her management role.\n\nIn the early days of home ownership, self-advocacy is key, said Lee.\n\n\u201cI do feel like there\u2019s this kind of posture of\u2026 curiosity and humility and persistence that\u2019s required through the purchase process and also your first year,\u201d said Lee. \u201cBecause most of us just don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know \u2026 It\u2019s okay to ask questions, it\u2019s okay to really be persistent, and where there\u2019s one closed door, I\u2019m gonna find another door that\u2019s open.\u201d\n\nScheduling aMass Save home energy auditis one example of a great early resource, said Lee, as is applying for resident tax rates for the new address, which can save hundreds if not thousands of dollars.\n\nNew homeowners can be attractive targets for sales pitches, and knowing how to navigate them will help.\n\n\u201cI think everybody who buys a home is going to quickly get started getting solicited,\u201d said Schmiedl.\n\nInstead of rushing into potentially costly improvement projects, slow down.\n\n\u201cLive in it for a year,\u201d said Schmiedl.\n\n\nRushing design changes can interfere with function before owners get a chance to live in the home.\n\nAllison Tilly Carswell and Andrea Canty, ofRed Door Design + Staging, suggested pausing before rushing toward trendy upgrades, such as recessed lighting and open floor plans. Recessed lighting is really best used to illuminate the path in hallways, or to light a kitchen work area. Lamps are more configurable elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve walked into a space and said something like, \u2018You might enjoy your home more if there [was] a wall here separating the entryway from your living room,\u2019 and the homeowners say, \u2018Oh, we took that wall down,\u2018\u201d said Carswell.\n\nTo figure out a design that fits your lifestyle, prioritize heavily used rooms first, said Canty. And paint can go a long way to refresh previous renovations that may not match your tastes, such as on cabinetry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and fill the house right away,\u201d saidRobin Gannon, a Lexington-based designer with national clientele. Live with what you have in order to help you assess the flow and use of a space before investing in higher-quality pieces. In week one, that won\u2019t be clear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re buying somebody else\u2019s taste,\u201d said Gannon.\n\nSpend some time reflecting on your own style, she said. A few quality placeholders can help along the way, such asSisal rugsto unify a room. Try a bold wall color. And in a year, you can always repaint.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to your friends \u2014 listen to your gut,\u201d said Gannon.\n\nSocial media and AI design schemes can intrude on taste. Algorithmic churn can be self-reinforcing, as it spits out more examples like what you\u2019ve already looked for, said Gannon.\n\n\u201cI always say, you can like something but not necessarily want to live with it,\u201d she said.\n\nTo break that cycle, Gannon suggested cross-referencing magazines and different manufacturers rather than following a social media rabbit hole.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed in the first year of homeownership.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in this house that\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d said Santiago, who said he has made an effort to do his own repairs when possible, saving hundreds on smaller projects. He was quickly able to swap out the smoke detectors and manage the ants himself.\n\n\u201cIf you break it down and do one thing at a time, it\u2019s very manageable,\u201d he said.\n\nSantiago paid $656,500 for the three-story, two-family home with town house-style units (front and back), which he said helped qualify for the loan. A first-generation homeowner in his family, he saw gaps in home buyer education, which he said didn\u2019t address post-move issues. Santiago has since acquired his own real estate license with the hope of providing a different experience for others.\n\nEstablishing a home in the first year can mean more than new boilers and bathroom renovations.\n\n\u201cHome is a home, but it\u2019s part of [a] community as well,\u201d said Schmiedl. \u201cA lot of good can come from that.\u201d\n\nAs Santiago began work on his home\u2019s exterior, he discovered several bottles and silverware items dating back to the 1850s. But the project turned up more than artifacts.\n\n\u201cFrom all the hours and hours and hours of work\u2026 I met all of our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s gonna be on the other side. \u201cMaybe you meet somebody new, or maybe you find a cool bottle.\u201d\n\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen Jayne O\u2019Brien lost her husband Bill suddenly in March 2024, she faced two difficult challenges. While dealing with shock and grief, she also wondered where she would live. The couple had been living in Bill\u2019s home in Eastham during their five-year marriage, but after his death, his daughter inherited the house.\n\nO\u2019Brien, 71, still owned a home in nearby Brewster, which she\u2019d been renting to her son and his girlfriend. Her son promptly offered to move out, but O\u2019Brien declined.\n\nA friend put O\u2019Brien in touch with a Maine-based company calledBackyard ADUs, which builds accessory dwelling units. Defined as a secondary residential living space located on the same lot as a single-family home, an ADU can be a freestanding structure or a unit attached to the primary home. They\u2019ve caught on as an affordable way to address housing shortages in states from California to Maine. O\u2019Brien\u2019s son was immediately on board with building one.\n\n\n\u201cWe talked a lot about how to do this and still preserve independence and privacy for both of us,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nADUs are poised for expansion on Cape Cod: TheAffordable Homes Act, which went into effect on Feb. 2, now requires municipalities to permit the building of ADUs in single-family zoning districts throughout Massachusetts, relieving a range of zoning challenges that prevented people from building ADUs across the state.\n\nADU growth will be especially beneficial in places like the Cape, where the cost of housing \u2014 and renovating \u2014 is prohibitively expensive. The annual median sales price of a single-family home in Barnstable County increased from $433,000 in 2019 to $730,000 in 2023, according to theCape Cod Commission, an organization that works to address the region\u2019s housing crisis and develop innovative land use policies.\n\n\u201cAccessory dwelling units are one of the many tools that we can employ to develop more affordable housing options,\u201d explained Kristy Senatori, executive director of the commission. \u201cThey\u2019re not a panacea, but it is relatively easy to add units or density to an existing neighborhood through the use of ADUs while maintaining the architectural character of the area. Certainly that\u2019s critical to Cape Cod\u2019s identity and our economy on the Cape.\u201d\n\nIn addition to serving as homes for aging relatives, ADUs also can support the Cape\u2019s year-round population by providing a source of rental income.\n\n\u201cOur clients are definitely interested in it, both buyers and sellers,\u201d said Katie Clancy, sales vice president atWilliam Raveis Real Estate in Yarmouth Port. \u201cLenders are seizing the opportunity, too, by letting borrowers use potential ADU income count in the mortgage apps.\u201d\n\nTim O\u2019Reilly, director of preconstruction for Backyard ADUs, says the majority of their business is building 500 to-1,200 square-foot homes for multigenerational living.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re often designing with an aging in place lens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had folks who said \u2018Hey, I built this for my adult son with disabilities, or for my mom.\u2019 Or \u2018Hey, I could rent this out for several years and pay down my costs, then move my family in.\u2018\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly emphasized the range of success stories. \u201cIt\u2019s about having that flexibility \u2014 it\u2019s in my backyard, and now I can do what makes the most sense,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, O\u2019Brien is a few weeks out from moving into a 642-square-foot abode in her backyard. As a self-described outdoors person, she isn\u2019t concerned about the limited living space, as she relishes her large deck, outdoor shower, and sizable yard for gardening.\n\n\u201cI do feel like [my son] and I are the poster family for the necessity and benefits of zoning that allows for ADUs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an affordable option and one that will enhance my property now and in the future.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Watch out, Florida \u2014 there could be a new Sunshine State in town.\nIn the sun-scorched expanse of Arizona, a former farming outpost 22 miles southeast of Phoenix is quietly redefining itself as a Southwestern rival to Florida\u2019s seasonal allure, according toMansion Global.\nGilbert, a sprawling suburb of 72 square miles with a population topping 275,000, has shed its agrarian past \u2014 once dominated by dairy cows and hayfields \u2014 to emerge as a magnet for snowbirds.\nWith housing costs that undercut its glitzier neighbor Scottsdale and a climate delivering 300 days of sunshine annually, Gilbert is carving out a niche as the \u201cnew Florida\u201d of the Southwest, blending affordability with a lifestyle that echoes the Sunshine State\u2019s appeal.\nThe numbers tell part of the story.\nGilbert\u2019s median home price hovers at $550,000, a bargain compared to Scottsdale\u2019s $892,000, though luxury estates can climb as high as $25 million.\nEntry-level townhomes start at $300,000, while single-family homes typically exceed $400,000.\nMichael Steck, a Scottsdale-based agent with RETSY, sees the value proposition driving the shift.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely now becoming more of a target for snowbirds because of what you can get for the dollar,\u201d he told Mansion Global.\nLike Florida, Gilbert offers winter temperatures that rarely dip below the 40s, though summers sizzle at an average high of 97. Rainfall, a scant 9 inches annually, leaves room for the kind of outdoor living snowbirds crave \u2014 golf courses, walking trails, and soon, a 25-acre Cactus Surf Park set to open in September.\nBeyond the weather, Gilbert\u2019s transformation mirrors Florida\u2019s evolution from sleepy backwater to retiree paradise.\nIts agricultural heritage has left behind richer soil and more greenery than the surrounding desert, a visual respite akin to Florida\u2019s coastal landscapes.\nUpscale enclaves like West Lake Estates, with waterfront homes fetching millions, cater to second-home buyers, while neighborhoods like Agritopia and Morrison Ranch offer modern twists on farm-style architecture, diverging from the Southwest\u2019s usual adobe aesthetic.\nAdd in outdoor malls like SanTan Village, a burgeoning downtown with historic buildings turned trendy eateries, and recreational hubs like Gilbert Regional Park, the parallels to Florida\u2019s lifestyle grow sharper.\nYet Gilbert\u2019s rise hasn\u2019t been without turbulence.\nThe shadow of the Gilbert Goons, a gang tied to the 2023 killing of 16-year-old Preston Lord and designated a criminal outfit in 2024, briefly tarnished its image.\nStill, local real estate veteran Kirsten Horchler, who grew up in Gilbert and now works with Compass, brushes off the episode as an anomaly.\n\u201cTo classify it as the new Scottsdale or a mini Scottsdale is completely accurate,\u201d she toldDaily Mail, signaling the town\u2019s broader appeal. While she notes Scottsdale remains a snowbird favorite, Gilbert is catching up, with flagship restaurants from Phoenix and Scottsdale opening outposts there.\nEconomically, Gilbert bolsters its case with a robust job market in tech, renewable energy and manufacturing, bolstered by proximity to Phoenix.\nThe cost of living exceeds state and national averages, but residents argue the trade-off \u2014 top schools, parks and a family-friendly vibe \u2014 justifies it.\nHorchler emphasizes the draw for younger transplants, particularly Californians: \u201cIn my experience, it\u2019s been families, young families, families with multiple children.\u201d\nAs developable land dwindles, values are poised to surge, a dynamic Jon Cooper of Cooper Premier Properties LLC underscored to Mansion Global: \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much out of land.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping\u00a0new tariffson imported goods from 60 countries plunged the global stock markets into a state of turmoil, sparking\u00a0recession fears\u2014but the controversial trade policy could up end up being an unexpected boon for the luxury real estate market.\nNot\u00a0surprisingly,stock market performancehas an outsized impact on high-end-home buyers, who are more likely to invest in stocks than their less wealthy counterparts.\nAs of April 6, the S&P 500 had tumbled by 15% since Trump\u2019s inauguration in late January, according toCNN, amid a growing economic uncertainty. In the wake of his tariff rollout on April 2, which the president touted as \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d stock markets around the world suffered\u00a0an estimated loss of about $10 trillion in market value.\nDays of up-and-down trading followed, as China retaliated against the U.S. with 84% tariffs. On April 9, the European Union approved new levies of its own on $23 billion in U.S.-made products, according toReuters.\nTrump then responded bypausing all the new tariffs for 90 days, with the exception of China, on whom he increased the tariffs to 125%.\nHowever, a potential silver lining to this frenzied market volatility is that it could prompt jittery investors to spurn stocks in favor of pricey real estate, \u201cas they seek the reliability of a tangible asset,\u201d\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0Chief Economist\u00a0Danielle Hale\u00a0predicts in her\u00a02025 Luxury Housing Market Outlook.\n\u201cIn an economic environment riddled with uncertainty, investors are seeking out safe havens. For many, this is found in bonds, but real estate may be an alternative for some,\u201d says Hale. \u201cWhile real estate can lose value, it is a tangible asset that not only provides shelter, it tends to have more stable pricing than stocks.\u201d\nShould Trump make another U-turn and fully implement the tariffs as announced, according to Hale, that could undermine economic growth, diminishing incomes and investment returns, and shrinking homebuyers\u2019 purchasing power.\n\u201cFor now, it looks like a reprieve has been issued for many countries, but as we\u2019ve seen very clearly in the last few weeks, the situation can change, so it\u2019s wise for high-end-home buyers to stay abreast of the news,\u201d Hale notes.\nThe good news for these deep-pocketed house hunters is that the high-end real estate market has plenty of room to grow.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nThe total value of domestic household real estate at the end of 2024 reached the second-highest level ever recorded, according to a\u00a0Realtor.com analysis, totaling a staggering $48.1 trillion, representing a 7% increase from the previous year. Notably, gains in real estate value were largest among the ultrarich.\nEven so, real estate value made up just 18.7% of total assets among the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households, down from just under 20% two years prior.\nMeanwhile, corporate equities, which include futures and other financial instruments, as well as mutual fund shares, comprised more than a third of their assets, the highest share ever recorded.\nSimply put, real estate made up a smaller portion of the average portfolios of the affluent set late last year, signaling that there is a lot of growth potential in the high-end housing market.\n\u201cThe combination of significant stock market wealth and relatively low debt in real estate among the wealthiest 10% suggests that this cohort has more capacity for real estate investment,\u201d says Hale.\nThe Realtor.com economist warns that real estate has its own set of issues, namely, property taxes and insurance costs, as well as maintenance and upkeep.\n\u201cStill, real estate can be a place to park money, and when the world feels uncertain, we often see an interest in home and real estate purchases,\u201d Hale adds.\nThe appeal of the U.S. luxury housing market is not lost on moneyed Russians, who reportedly have resumed buying eye-wateringly expensive properties in New York City after a 10-year hiatus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had five Russians look at properties in the $10 million to $20 million range in the past few weeks\u2014condos and town houses,\u201d a New York broker was quoted as telling the outletAir Mail.\nThe shift, according to the unnamed broker, comes down to Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian\u00a0President\u00a0Vladimir Putin, whom he previously praised as a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201csavvy,\u201d before souring on the Kremlin strongman over his intransigence in theproposed peace deal with Ukraine.\nBut the cooling relations between the two world leaders apparently have done nothing to diminish wealthy Russians\u2019 homeownership ambitions on U.S. soil.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t afraid to buy anymore,\u201d the broker told the outlet about the incoming Eastern European investors.\nThe reason for that is that the Trump administration appears to be more welcoming to Russian oligarchs than its Democratic predecessor. Although sanctions against Putin\u2019s government and Russian companies are still in effect, the current Justice Department has done away with units that investigated misbegotten money invested in real estate and yachts.\nA Douglas Elliman broker told Air Mail that her Russian clients currently living in Monaco are looking forward to buying real estate in the U.S. because they value American education and high-quality new construction.\nData from theNational Association of Realtors\u00aesuggests that the $1 million-plus category of homes has been the fastest-growing sales share for 21 consecutive months, and now makes up 7.6% of recent home sales.\nThe reason for that is that affluent homebuyers more often have a lot of existing equity and do not have to rely on mortgage financing, and, therefore, they are not deterred by the high rates.\nHowever, the number of for-sale homes priced above $1 million shrank, amounting to an average of 12.8% of all listings year to date in 2025. For comparison, in 2024 that share was 13.6%.\nTime on the market for high-end listings shimmied down from 76 days to 75, even as homes priced below $1 million remained unsold for 64 days, up from 58 the year before.\nOn top of that, price cuts have ticked up from 20.8% to 22.6% among homes with an asking price below $1 million, but remained roughly flat among luxury properties.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Despite a flood of new rentals and longer listing times in March, New Yorkers continued to duke it out for apartments at near-record prices.\nRental market activity swelled across New York City last month. High prices and minimal vacancy rates stubbornly persisted, despite higher inventory, anew reportby Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel revealed.\nManhattan rents remained at record highs, Brooklyn bidding wars persisted and Queens lease signings surged.\nMahmoud Ammar, a critical care pharmacist, learned the hard way how difficult it has become to find the right apartment for the right price.\nAmmar, who works from home, had a lease with a roommate ending on April 1. He began his hunt for his very own one-bedroom in late February.\nAmmar and his agent, Tim Cass of Corcoran, spent multiple weekends touring two to three apartments per day, plus some tours scattered through the work week. Ammar had a budget of $3,000 to $3,500 and the desire to live solo in Midtown West.\nBut he kept losing out on the good ones, affordable one-bedrooms became a pipe dream and nearly every landlord wanted immediate occupancy.\n\u201cIt became stressful because I knew I\u2019d be moving out in three weeks, and I still didn\u2019t have an apartment,\u201d Ammar told The Post.\nAt $4,471, Manhattan\u2019s median effective rent \u2014 which factors in landlord discounts and concessions \u2014 tied for the highest on record, up annually for the sixth time. Despite pricing pain, new lease signings rose in March, a month not typically known for its rental activity. The data signals a difficult rest of the year for hopeful renters.\n\u201cTypically you look at the beginning of a month for the start of the following month, but in this environment, you have to take it as soon as you see it,\u201d Cass said. \u201cWe missed out on several properties because Mahmoud hesitated.\u201d\nCass said historically the market heats up around Mother\u2019s Day in May. That\u2019s not the case anymore.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening much, much earlier now, as we experienced,\u201d Cass said. \u201cMarch was a very popular month for renters.\u201d\nInventory just met demand in March, the Elliman report found, getting absorbed as fast as it arrived. Vacancy rates in Manhattan barely budged, but listing inventory increased year-over-year by 23.1%.\nDespite intense demand, days on the market increased from 57 days inred-hot Februaryto 42 in March, suggesting some modest degree of cooling.\nBut as Cass and Ammar learned, not all inventory is created equal. Cass described going with Ammar to an apartment on West 57th Street that \u201csounded too good to be true.\u201d\nA line of a dozen people had already formed outside.\n\u201cWhen we finally got inside, the tenant was still sitting in the apartment, and we noticed there were mouse traps,\u201d Cass said. \u201cThere was a reason that it was priced so reasonably for a one-bedroom in that neighborhood. We couldn\u2019t wait to get out.\u201d\nMedian Manhattan rents in March decreased by $5 from February, down to $4,495. But last month\u2019s net-effective rent tied with February for the highest on record, at $4,471, indicating that renters are getting less grace from landlords.\u00a0Rates of landlord concessions and listing discounts fell in Manhattan.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hesitate in this market,\u201d Cass said. \u201cYou have to act quickly. If you snooze, you lose.\u201d\nAverage rental price per square foot also rose to a new high in Brooklyn for the third straight month, and Queens saw an eighteenth annual increase in lease signings.\nThe incidence of bidding wars across the three boroughs declined slightly from February, but the rates remain historically high, particularly in Kings County.\nOne in three new Brooklyn renters paid more than the landlord asked. One out of five rentals in Manhattan and Northwest Queens \u2014 which is home to Astoria \u2014 went for above the listing price.\nThe past several months of heavy competition doesn\u2019t bode well for a rental market beset by economic uncertainty.\n\u201cA lot of buyers are having difficulty at the moment, because of interest rates,\u201d Cass said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t buy something, they\u2019re getting into the rental market. I think that is increasing the demand.\u201d\nThankfully, Ammar\u2019s story has a happy ending. He settled on an alcove loft apartment in the heart of Midtown West at $3,400 plus full fees. The place came with a doorman, an elevator and big windows.\n\u201cEighth Avenue in the afternoon brings a lot of sunshine in, and with plants and flowers, it just makes it feel really nice,\u201d Ammar said. \u201cAnd those big windows make a big difference, especially since I work from home. I love the location.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Ninth St. in the East Village, is now slated for residential redevelopment.\nWhat the Henicks intend to do with their two Ann Street parcels \u2014 located between Nassau and William streets in the Financial District \u2014 remains uncertain. No additional construction applications have surfaced in city records.\nThe Post has reached out to Jeffrey Henick for comment.\nThe fallout from the 2023 collapse has also disrupted lives beyond the immediate vicinity.\nA family of five residing at a 12-unit residential Ann Street building nearby, foundtheir lives upendedafter being displaced indefinitely.\nThe Cohen family, as The Post reported in 2024, relocated to a house with a wraparound porch in Westfield, N.J.

        "content": "By Regina Cole, The Boston Globe\n\n\nFor many years a center of the paper industry, Millinocket struggled to rebuild its economy after theGreat Northern Paper Companyclosed in 2008. Today, Millinocket is up and coming as a four-season tourist attraction. The gateway to Mount Katahdin, Maine\u2019s highest mountain, Moosehead Lake, and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, the town exemplifies Vacationland. As Laura Blake of Legacy Properties in Damariscotta put it, \u201cWe are so very lucky to live in Maine and enjoy its four seasons.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to vacation in the Bay State, there are areas less crowded and less expensive than the Cape, the North Shore, and the Berkshires, but that still have scenic areas near recreation. One of these is East Longmeadow, situated in the Pioneer Valley between Springfield and the towns of northern Connecticut. East Longmeadow was once a center of red and brown sandstone quarrying: the stone making up the original building of Washington\u2019s Smithsonian Institution museum is from here. TheElijah Burt House, built between 1720 and 1740, is worth a visit. It is believed to be the oldest surviving building in the town, and a station on the Underground Railroad.\n\n\nNew Hampshire real estate prices have been rising, but the occasional quality home for under $400,000 still exists. An area to search is Center Barnstead, a community in the town of Barnstead and the largest of several villages in the town. It is close to the Lakes Region, which has convenient access to the hundreds of lakes south of the White Mountains. There you will find ski areas, art galleries, beaches, restaurants, ice cream shops, and all the other destinations vacationers seek, but with rural tranquility and scenic beauty.\n\n\n\nFor good reason, the coast of Maine is a magnet for vacationers. With its countless harbors, coves, headlands, beaches, and islands, it is unparalleled for scenic beauty, fresh air, and fresh lobster. But, as with any desirable area, it is pricey, with houses in coastal towns fetching far more than inland real estate.\n\nThis changes as you leave behind the crowds of the mid-coast and head Down East to Washington County. At the end of the road, at the Canadian border, is Eastport. With just a little over 1,000 people, it is the least-populous city in Maine, but also one of its most historic: Eastport celebrated its bicentennial in 1998.\n\nIt is one of the most festival-minded communities in Maine. Navy ships have docked here during the Fourth of July celebration for many years. Every September, the city hosts the annual Maine Salmon Festival in the historic downtown district, and, for 20 years, there has been a Pirate Festival the weekend after Labor Day.\n\n\nVermont has maple syrup, great cheese, legendary ski mountains, picture-perfect villages, and cows grazing on hillsides unspoiled by billboards or strip malls. In the southern part of the state, between Mount Snow and Stratton Mountain in theGreen Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forest, is Wardsboro.\n\nThis small town encompasses five villages, one of which literally has the name Podunk. Wardsboro has scenic beauty and recreational opportunities \u2014 Somerset Reservoir and Grout Pond are minutes from Main Street, and the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers Snowmobile trails run through the town \u2014 but none of the crowds and condos of nearby ski areas.\n\n\nHunters, hikers, nature lovers, and those who simply want to get away from it all head to the pine-scented peace of Maine\u2019s western mountains. Eustis, which includes the village of Stratton, is located about halfway betweenSugarloaf Mountainand the Canadian border. It is on the Dead River,which provided transportation for Benedict Arnold and his troops in 1775, when they made their way to fight in the ill-fated Battle of Quebec. Later, the river was known for log drives, which involved floating wood down the river to mills, a deadly practice that was banned in 1976. Now the Dead River is a popular destination for white-water rafting.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Kara Baskin, The Boston Globe\n\nFor decades, people have bought property with a partner or their biological family members. But amid a skyrocketing housing market and loneliness becoming a public health epidemic, aspiring buyers are looking beyond the traditional nuclear family to find new financial and social solutions to homeownership.\n\nAt the end of April, Harvard Law School plans to release a landmark guidebook called \u201cHow to Buy Property with Chosen Family,\u201d which addresses how to approach traditional institutions such as banks and real estate agencies as a nontraditional unit. The first-of-its-kind primer, which will be published by the school\u2019sLGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic, is for people trying to buy a home with friends or anyone hoping to live in a nonstandard structure.\n\nThe arrangement is often associated with polyamory,but the clinic emphasizes that the guide can apply to a group of friends, multiple families, or anybody who wants to break into the housing market but doesn\u2019t have the desire or resources to go it alone. The guide offers strategies such as creating a tenancy in common agreement or an LLC, which offers ownership agreements and stipulates financial consequences in case a living arrangement goes south.\n\n\u201cAmong a lot of people I know, this is the main way that they see themselves being able to [buy] \u2014 and it also seems like a much better idea than becoming isolated in your own little suburban enclave without access to community,\u201d saidSamara Trilling, a third-year Harvard Law student who coauthored the guidebook in collaboration with thePolyamory Legal Advocacy Coalition(PLAC).\n\nThe guide comes at the right time, Trilling said, as more people simply crave community and homeownership. The structure \u2014 romantic or platonic \u2014 makes financial sense, and the guide\u2019srelease coincides with a shift in household demographics. As of 2025, an estimated61 million Americans (nearly 20 percent of the population)co-own a home with someone who isn\u2019t their spouse, according to a new survey by CoBuy, an end-to-end platform to simplify nontraditional home buying.\n\n\u201cMany people are not in a nuclear family. That is just not the state of American families anymore. \u2026 And cities are sort of having to grapple with: Wait a second. If that\u2019s not actually reflecting our constituents, how do we build in pathways toward generational wealth that actually can meet people where they\u2019re at?\u201d said Kimberly Rhoten, a PLAC cofounder.\n\nSomerville is a groundbreaking example.In 2020, spurred by COVID and the desire for all people to easily visit loved ones in the hospital,the City Council passed an ordinancerecognizing domestic partnerships, including polyamorous relationships. Somerville again made news in 2023 when the City Council approved a unique anti-discrimination ordinance to protect people in polyamorous and other consensually nonmonogamous relationships. The ordinance prohibits discrimination in employment and policing against those in relationships of two or more people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from people who moved to our community specifically because of these [2023] laws and because of the domestic partnership ordinance that passed in 2020,\u201d said Willie Burnley Jr., a Somerville city councilor-at-large and mayoral candidate who is polyamorous and rents his home with platonic roommates.\n\n\nPLAC has done similar work in Cambridge, and the progress has been logistically helpful to home buyers \u2014 but also symbolic to people who often feel stigmatized due to lifestyle choices, proponents said.\n\nHeath Schechinger, another PLAC cofounder and executive director of the nationwideModern Family Institute, enjoyed lower utility costs and a bigger home than he would have otherwise afforded while living with two other couples. Of course, the arrangement wasn\u2019t perfect.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have this unilateral capacity to make decisions on my own or that I thought would be best,\u201d Schechinger said. \u201cAlso, there was some social stigma.\u201d\n\nBut the benefits were worth it, and Schechinger is hopeful that laws and housing models will catch up to prospective homeowners\u2019 financial and social realities.\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of people are living with their chosen family: buying homes with friends or partners, or building family through shared values rather than marriage. The future of family isn\u2019t about form. It\u2019s about function \u2014 and who you build your life with.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "A striking piece of Hamptons architectural history is coming on the market.\nA one-of-a-kind, 141-year-old summer cottage in Water Mill is going up for sale,the Wall Street Journal reported. The lodge was built in 1884 by a clergyman named Rev. Henry Turbell Rose. Rose paid his uncle $50 for half an acre of Water Mill farmland and $25 for a house design.\nFast forward centuries, a time in which the Hamptons because a playground for the rich and famous, and the reverend could not have imagined that his quaint summer cottage would one day go on the market for $14.25 million.\nThe home is named Rosemary Lodge \u2014 a combination of Rose\u2019s last name and that of his wife, Mary.\nThe late Victorian house wasadded to the National Register of Historic Placesin 2000, in which it was described as \u201ca highly intact example of the Shingle Style\u201d and praised for Rose\u2019s exceptional workmanship.\nThe home spans a little over 4,100 square feet and two-and-a-half stories. It boasts a large porch, a steep gabled roof and shingle exteriors with red trim. Each room is clad in a different type of wood, the Journal reported.\nElaborate interior woodwork, crafted by Rose and inspired by the English Tudor period, features floral motifs and even carved inscriptions of Shakespeare, according to the Register.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so different from going to these new houses, where everything is white and it\u2019s all glass windows,\u201d listing agent Steven Dorn of Brown Harris Stevens told The Journal.\nRosemary Lodge last changed hands in 2005, according to Suffolk County records, for $2.57 million.\nRecent restorations remained faithful to the home\u2019s old-world details, the Journal reported, but not the home\u2019s old footprint. According to the National Register, Rosemary Lodge was moved nearly half a mile south in 1985. A pool and a pool house were added after the move.\nThe current owners renovated the kitchen and bathrooms, the Journal reported, as well as built a screened-in porch. The owners are generously including 50 pieces of original furniture and cabinetry, as well, all built by Rose.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A resurrected Great Scott music venue in Allston, a new zoning district surrounding the Roslindale Village MBTA Commuter Rail station, and housing projects in five neighborhoods all got the go-ahead from the Boston Planning and Development Agency board on Thursday evening.The board approved 591 residential units and some 588,000 square feet of development, including a 333-unit project at 83 Leo Birmingham Parkway in Brighton.The beloved Great Scott closed in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, a trio of business partners \u2014 real estate developer Jordan Warshaw, Great Scott\u2019s longtime booking manager Carl Lavin, and Paul Armstrong, CEO of music company Redefined \u2014 bought several parcels at the corner of Cambridge Street and Harvard Avenue in Allston to make way for a new venue, with housing above. The BPDA board on Thursday approved a nine-story building at 1 Harvard Ave., with 139 apartments atop a new Great Scott and O\u2019Brien\u2019s Pub.Warshaw said the proposed project had seen an outpouring of community support.Advertisement\u201cOne thing that has made Boston Boston is its arts and culture,\u201d Warshaw said. \u201cBoston is a place that has been known for decades and decades and decades as a really dense spot for local music. \u2026 So many of those great old venues don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201dStill, the project could be a ways from starting construction. Trying to work out a realistic budget is difficult, he said, given given the turmoil in global financial markets and uncertainty over tariffs.

Just 11 percent of Roslindale\u2019s 6,600 land parcels are zoned for multifamily housing currently, said Abdul-Razak Zachariah of the Boston Planning Department. Boston City Councilor Enrique J. Pep\u00e9n supported the plan.Planning Department staff pursued community engagement in a variety of ways that went beyond the standard mid-week after-business-hours meetings, including mailing 1,700 postcards to residents and property owners and hosting weekly office hours \u2014 including some afternoon sessions at the Roslindale Branch of the Boston Public Library to reach young families.Priscilla Rojas, the BPDA board chair, said the way the Planning Department has transformed how it collects community data \u201cis phenomenal.\u201d\u201cThese are ways that your daily actions are helping to build that trust with the community,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cZoning reform is not for the faint of heart.\u201dAdvertisementThe Boston Zoning Commission is expected to vote on the Roslindale plan in May.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "For more than a century, Gillette has been making razor blades in South Boston, near the Fort Point Channel. Now, the company is preparing to make something quite different there: a whole new neighborhood.P&G Gillette on Friday filed a long-awaited master plan with city officials for its 31-acre campus along the southern edge of the channel, a block or so from the Broadway T station on the Red Line. It\u2019s the latest milestone in the company\u2019s efforts to redo its two Massachusetts sites, as it pulls its manufacturing work out of South Boston to make way for this ambitious 20-building redevelopment. Much of the manufacturing work will shift to Gillette\u2019s other local property, a 150-acre site in Andover, with a groundbreaking scheduled to take place on that expansion next Thursday.The 5.7-million-square-foot development in South Boston could take a decade or more to fully build out. The total vision includes 1,800 housing units across nine buildings, or 1.7 million square feet, and another 3.5 million square feet of commercial space for offices and labs as well as 200,000 square feet of shops and restaurants and 250,000 square feet of hotel space. The buildings would range in height from four or five stories, along the channel, to taller buildings such as a 320-foot high residential tower near the T station. The project also includes a 6.5-acre public park along the channel.\u201cWe\u2019ve long been proud of our heritage here in Massachusetts,\u201d said Kara Buckley, vice president of community affairs at Gillette. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the legacy we could leave behind through this plan.\u201dAdvertisementGillette, part of Procter & Gamble since 2005, employs about 1,150 people in South Boston. That number includes roughly 400 people in manufacturing \u2014 all of whom, Gillette says, will have a job in Andover if they want one. Manufacturing employees will start moving in one to two years. Meanwhile, Gillette is looking at leasing real estate in South Boston to accommodate roughly 750 white-collar workers for its headquarters and technical innovation center where research and engineering takes place, though it\u2019s possible they could remain on the property as it gets redeveloped.The fundamental real estate shifts were first announced in October 2023. Since that time, Gillette has sought feedback from the public, holding 15 community meetings over the past two years and working with development consultant Leggat McCall, architectural firm CBT, and others to design this new neighborhood.The master plan needs city approval, but so will most new individual buildings at a later date.CBT urban design director Kishore Varanasi said the master plan is designed to link with other improvements along the channel, as well as open up new streets through the fenced-off campus to the waterfront. A key tenet in the design, he said, was \u201cto not think of this as an enclave in its own right but a pretty significant piece of a larger puzzle.\u201dVaranasi said most of the site will be raised up by at least six feet and will also feature an extension of a berm planned for that side of the channel. Much of the property is covered by the state\u2019s Chapter 91 tidelands law, which limits how much can be built near the water. As a result, half of the 31 acres would be open to the public, though that includes new streets, sidewalks, and plazas as well as the open space.AdvertisementGillette also wants to ensure the redevelopment includes spaces for civic and cultural uses.To Kate Dineen, chief executive of business group A Better City, the Gillette master plan addresses key city priorities such as building more mixed-income housing, climate resiliency, and more public waterfront access. In particular, she cited the waterfront park as a \u201cmarquee investment\u201d for the city.\u201cAn important element of feedback they received from the community [is] they don\u2019t want cookie-cutter development,\u201d Dineen said. \u201cThey want vibrancy and uniqueness. I think you see that represented across this master plan.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto.",

However, local records don\u2019t show documentation for a forthcoming demolition and it isn\u2019t clear if, should the standing residence face the wrecking ball, an empty lot will eventually return for sale.\nWhat\u2019s for certain: Severe vandalism and decades of neglect have rendered the property uninhabitable.\nBuilt in 1931 on one of the original large Bel-Air lots developed by oil magnate Alphonzo Bell, the estate boasts a storied past.\nIn the 1960s, it was home to Arthur Freed, the Hollywood producer behind classics like \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d\nIbrahim bin Laden, one of 56 children of Saudi construction magnate Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, acquired the property in 1983 for $1.65 million alongside his then-wife, Los Angeles socialite Christine Hartunian Sinay.\nThe couple, who share a daughter, Sibba Hartunian, maintained a lavish lifestyle there, employing \u201cfull-time groundskeepers, household help, chauffeurs and private security,\u201d according to Steve Coll\u2019s book, \u201cThe Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century.\u201d\nThe seven-bedroom, five-bathroom mansion \u2014 complete with a guest house, a greenhouse and a pool \u2014 was abandoned after the Sept.11 terror attacks.\nIbrahim, who was abroad at the time, never returned to the US, wary of the stigma attached to his surname.\nA former University of Southern California student who admitted he \u201cnever worked a day in [his] life,\u201d Ibrahim leased the property out \u2014 and by 2010, it had become a porn filming location.\nDespite its prime location \u2014 a short walk from the iconic Hotel Bel-Air \u2014 the estate\u2019s condition deteriorated.\nBoarded-up windows failed to deter vandals, and the interior fell into disrepair \u2014 with only sparse images available due to its decrepit state.\nThe listing highlighted its value as a \u201crare lower Bel-Air lot with elevation and an elevated pad,\u201d noting that the price reflected the land alone, as the home had been \u201cready for redoing, owner has not been here for over 20 years.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "What\u2019s old is new again \u2014 so much so that this home, rumored to be the oldest in The Bronx, is newly available for sale.\nEven if it isn\u2019t, the Old Hadley Farm House \u2014 a five-bed, 2.5-bath residence located near Fieldston \u2014 is certainly one of the oldest surviving dwellings in the borough. It listed this week for $1.49 million, according to StreetEasy.\n\u201cIt really tells the story of New York in one house. And it\u2019s not like you drive along a tree-lined driveway to get there. It\u2019s smack dab in the middle of your of a regular-looking Bronx Street,\u201d Nick Dembowski, a historian at the nearby Van Cortlandt House Museum, told The Post.\nThe landmarked residence spans 2,660 square feet and includes a sunroom, a detached two-car garage and a large yard on 0.34 acres.\nA historic stone fireplace and 2-foot-thick-walls add to its extra-old world charm.\nNo one has been able to date, with certainly, the home\u2019s original stone structure. Unconfirmed claims of the home\u2019s existence in 1747 would predate even the Van Cortlandt Mansion, which holds the confirmed title of oldest residence in the borough.\u00a0That year would even predate the United States.\nNot even Dembowski, whoextensively profiled the propertyfor the Kingsbridge Historical Society, can say far back the home goes.\nA tenant farmer named Isaac Green was the home\u2019s first recorded occupant, in addition to five enslaved people. There is little information on his residence before the American Revolution. William and Elizabeth Hadley purchased the home and its property in 1786.\nThe Hadley Farm House saw its fair share of action during the war, when local skirmishes between rebels and British troops were commonplace. The home served as a British outpost when, in 1778, an audacious French office led rebel troops on a night raid of the property.\nColonel Armand, according to records cited by Dembowski, snuck up on the troops in the dark \u2014 their lookout guy was apparently drunk \u2014 and \u201ckind of slapped them around a little bit and humiliated them.\u201d\nThe rebels, according to one account, gave the troops at Hadley Farm House \u201ca very sound drubbing.\u201d\nArmand proudly documented his exploitsin a letter to George Washington.\nThe home assumed its current form in 1915, according tothe landmark designation report, with an expansion and renovation by renowned architect Dwight James Baum. Baum totally overhauled the home, but maintained some of its oldest details, including wood beams crafted from halved tree trunks \u2014 bark intact.\nProperty records indicate that the property last changed hands in 1999. The current ownerslisted the propertyin 2024 for a higher $2.25 million, but found no takers.\nThe listing\u2019s current broker, James Endress of Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said the property is \u201cbasically in estate condition.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in disrepair, anyone driving by the house can see,\u201d Endress said.\nThe exterior of the house is landmarked, so it will require special care and expense in its restoration, but the detached garage is not. A new owner could tear it down and subdivide the 20-something-foot lot, Endress said. Selling it to an investor could offset the new owner\u2019s inevitable renovation costs.\nThe listing urges buyers to \u201cbring your architect and your imagination.\u201d\n\u201cMy sincere hope is that whoever ends up buying this house has the means to really preserve it, because it does need a fair amount of preservation work,\u201d Dembowski said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "New York\u2019s got the juice, snagging four of the nation\u2019s fastest-selling housing markets in January 2025, even as the broader US housing market trudges along at its slowest clip since pre-COVID days.\nRedfin\u2019s latest datashows homes nationwide took a median of 56 days to find buyers \u2014 up a week from last year and the longest wait since January 2020. But the Empire State\u2019s metro areas are defying the sluggish trend, closing deals at a breakneck pace and stealing the spotlight from slower regions.\nLeading the charge is Rochester, where properties flew off the market in a median of just 13 days, the fastest in the country.\nNearby Buffalo wasn\u2019t far behind, with homes snapped up in 16 days. Albany, the state\u2019s capital city, clocked in at 25 days, and Long Island\u2019s Nassau County rounded out New York\u2019s strong showing among the top 10 quickest markets.\nAllentown, Pennsylvania, also hit the fast lane with 24 days, alongside Richmond, Virginia, at 27 days.\nNew York\u2019s dominance in speedy sales points to robust demand, potentially fueled by relative affordability and steady economic activity in these metros compared with pricier coastal hubs.\n\u201cThose areas are post-industrial,\u201d Kirsten Jordan, of the Corcoran Group, told The Post \u2014 and, indeed, Rochester and Buffalo are both in the Rust Belt. \u201cThey had this boom in the [20th century], where people were building homes and living there and working in factories, and then they left as the industrialization left.\u201d\nThis left behind a supply of older, often fixer-upper homes that remain affordable, with median prices aligning closer to the national range of \u201cthree hundred and something thousand dollars,\u201d she noted. \u201cThat makes a huge difference, especially for young people who just want to stabilize their living costs right now.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the national slowdown was stark in parts of the Sun Belt, particularly South Florida.\nFort Lauderdale homes lingered for a median of 92 days, with Miami close behind at 89 days \u2014 both of which were booming markets during the pandemic.\nAustin and West Palm Beach each posted 87 days, while Honolulu hit 84 days, placing them among the nation\u2019s slowest markets.\nOther factors, including a shortage of homes, also contribute as to why homes are selling the fastest in the region.\n\u201cThe northeast, and particularly New York, continues to be challenged by the lack of inventory which has kept days on market lower than markets in the Sun Belt states,\u201d appraiser Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel, added. \u201cComing out of the pandemic, significant domestic migration southward caused overbuilding in those areas and drew more listings into the market for sale.\u201d\nFlorida claimed four of the 10 slowest-selling metros, with most others in the South, signaling a cooling in regions that surged during the pandemic-era buying frenzy.\n\u201cRight now with Florida, the cost of carrying those homes is going up so much because of insurance,\u201d Jordan added, highlighting flood and natural disaster coverage as major expenses. \u201cYou\u2019re not dealing with those crazy numbers up in New York because of the fact that we\u2019re not seeing as much of those issues with regards to hurricanes.\u201d\nFlorida\u2019s metro areas also face infrastructure strain.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been to Miami recently \u2026 you literally have to drive around between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., otherwise you can\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d Jordan said.\nAdd to that the rising costs of full-service buildings, and the appeal dims compared to New York\u2019s single-family homes, where \u201cyou\u2019re not paying a doorman or anything like that,\u201d she added.\nThe contrast underscores a bifurcated market, where local factors like pricing and job growth drive outcomes.\nThe contrast with Texas, another slow mover, is equally telling. Austin\u2019s 87-day median reflects a cooling from its COVID-era boom.\nBut unsustainable demand and job shifts led some to rethink their moves, unlike in New York, where \u201cthere\u2019s a basic kind of stabilization of what people think that they\u2019re gonna have to pay to live in these places,\u201d Jordan noted.\nNew York\u2019s fast markets benefit from \u201cgood solid infrastructure and quality of life,\u201d Jordan said, fostering sustained demand.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nI simply refuse to let the recent dour weather dampen my enthusiasm for the onset of spring. Bulbs are up and beginning to bloom, my lawn finally looks greener, and the red maples and willows are flowering, providing subtle hues to the forests and wetlands.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget we are still coming out of a late-season drought from last year and that this rain is incredibly helpful in resetting reservoir and ground-water levels. Gardening and optimism go hand in hand, especially during the spring when the promise of rebirth, regrowth, and a fresh start imbues the soul and offers hope.\n\nI am fortunate to garden within two different temporal scales. Professionally, I work atGarden in the Woods, a 94-year-old garden in Framingham managed by theNative Plant Trust, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year. This is a magical space with plantings and displays that are only possible after decades of growth.\n\nAt my home, we are a mere six years in from when my wife and I became homeowners. Both spaces have valuable lessons to impart, but I will focus primarily on the beginnings of the garden journey as it aligns with the hope, optimism, and joy of spring in New England.\n\nBecoming a homeowner is exciting, daunting, nerve-wracking, and fulfilling all at once. My wife and I are avid gardeners, so we chose our home partly because of the property\u2019s potential.\n\nOur first step was to assess the trees\u2019 health in our yard. Inheriting a large, mature tree comes with a responsibility that previous owners shared, a belief that this organism and all the benefits we enjoy because of its presence are important enough to keep that tree in place. Ecologically, mature trees fulfill an outsized role in local ecosystems, having had decades to build and establish relationships with local wildlife.\n\nHowever, with any tree growing near our homes, we must also weigh risk. This is why an assessment from a professional arborist is crucial, especially from those who wish to keep old trees alive, rather than simply seeing the dollar signs associated with their removal. We had several larger dying ash trees in our backyard that were already shedding limbs, and with two young children in tow, the decision to remove them was easy. The large oak tree in our front yard, which provides summer shade, brilliant autumn color, and a towering presence, needed structural pruning and deadwood removal to ensure my family\u2019s safety under its boughs.\n\nWith the risks removed and mitigated, what trees would we want to plant for the future? This is the most enjoyable part of garden planning and a chance to put a long-range vision into motion. There are loads of options to consider, a shade tree, a flowering tree, or an oak because of its ability to sustain local wildlife. Picture what your tree will look like at maturity rather than when freshly planted, be sure to site the tree with enough room to grow and not cause future concerns with power lines, roof eaves, or fencing. Consider adding an evergreen as an anchor to your tree selections that will give you winter interest and even screen your yard from unwanted views.\n\n\nGardens are three-dimensional. Once you have considered the canopy, move onto the shrub layer. Shrubs generally require less maintenance than perennial or annual plantings and are a great way to hold space if you are unsure how much time you can devote to your garden. I have always loved trees and shrubs with fragrant flowers; their scent wafts into open windows and draws your attention back into the garden.\n\nWe chose to plant afringe tree(Chionanthus virginicus) outside our kitchen window, knowing that when in full bloom, you will smell its presence before you lay eyes on the tree itself. Lilacs, summersweet, and witch hazels are also great choices for fragrance in the garden. A third option would be to welcome a shrub that produces edible fruit. A plump, ripe blueberry plucked from your own shrub simply tastes more satisfying than store-bought ones.\n\n\nThe last consideration when starting a new garden would be choosingherbaceous plants, whether they are kitchen herbs such as lavender, rosemary, and sage or flowering perennials. Choosing culinary herbs is a great place to start, but don\u2019t feel pressured to make your decision immediately. There are a lot of choices to weigh and an overwhelming degree of choice at the garden center. In fact, there are too many to fully delve into here, much dependent on your garden and your budget.\n\nLet us pivot to consider the timeline of a new garden journey. You will need to observe and learn a lot about your property in order to make good choices. What are your site conditions? Sun or shade? You won\u2019t know some of the answers to these questions without observing your space over the course of a growing season. Beautiful, ecologically functional gardens take years to develop, so take your time, note your observations over the course of the first year, and begin drafting a plan for your garden. By focusing on the tree and shrub layers first, you create a framework within which to add color, texture, form, and function with herbaceous plants in successive seasons.\n\nAbove all, the gardening journey should be joyful, empowering and restorative. No one gets it perfect right from the start, and it is the lessons learned from our mistakes that help make us better gardeners in the future. Although six years have passed since my wife and I began our home garden odyssey, I feel like I am just getting started in a space where we can all grow old together.\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

        "content": "By Jim Morrison, The Boston Globe\n\nBuying a home that needs work can be a less expensive way to purchase real estate in the current housing market, but experts warn DIYers should know their limits.\n\nMorgan Cohen, owner of the home inspection firmMKC Associates, said he advises his clients to hire professionals to do electrical, heating, and plumbing work, but light carpentry, painting, and small repairs are great places for non-professionals to start building their DIY skills safely.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, we have seen plenty of homeowner attempts gone wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes a homeowner might know just enough to be dangerous, which can really get them into trouble and even result in higher costs to redo a project that didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d\n\nLinda O\u2019Koniewski, CEO ofLeading Edge Real Estate, said most people who buy fixer-uppers fall into one of two categories: Equity builders (who seek to maximize value) or dream creators (who seek to create a customized space). Those buyers should take a different approach to renovating.\n\n\u201cThe equity builder looks for the tired house where the owner prioritized substance over style,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can transform dated kitchens and baths without gut renovations using smart refreshes: new appliances, countertops, and strategic paint choices. Remember: the moment you fall in love with the project is the moment your profit margin starts shrinking.\u201d\n\nFor the dream creators, it\u2019s different. She said these buyers should forget about resale value and focus on creating a space that matches their lifestyle. But be forewarned: What\u2019s perfect for you might be a turnoff to future buyers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s buyers often prefer the Pinterest-perfect aesthetic over practical but unique customizations,\u201d she said.\n\nBruce Irving ofCompass Real Estatesaid most homeowners are better off hiring professional tradespeople to work on their homes. He said even doing professional-looking work is a lot harder than it looks on TV.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you will be satisfied with the result, but should it come time to sell, amateur work is usually quite apparent to buyers and their agents and is not rewarded in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring my time at \u201dThis Old House,\u201d we tended to steer our homeowners to tasks like job site cleanup, light landscaping, or exterior painting under supervision.\u201d\n\nBothHome DepotandLowe\u2019soffer free DIY workshops.\n\nJim Morrison can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].

        "content": "By the timeJonathan Montgomery,a British transplant living inAlaska, retired 15 years ago, he was thoroughly fed up with his adoptive home state\u2019s notoriously brutal winters. So he decided to become a snowbird and head for warmer shores.\n\u201cI view my life purpose as to be where the bad weather is not,\u201d Montgomery, 61, tellsRealtor.com\u00aein a recent email exchange while on one of his winter adventures abroad.\nHere\u2019s how it works for Montgomery: Six months out of the year, covering the spring and summer seasons, he lives inAnchorage, AK, enjoying the many outdoor activities the area has to offer. The other six months, the retiree splits between a guesthouse in Bali and a van in New Zealand, while renting out his home in the States.\n\u201cI spend exactly six months each year in Alaska\u2014and not one moment longer,\u201d Montgomery stresses.\nThanks to this arrangement, Montgomery has been able to retain his Alaska residency and collect what he described as \u201cfree money\u201d from the state government through the\u00a0Alaska Permanent Fund, which pays out annual dividends to every Alaskan from the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar oil and mining revenues.\nMontgomery says that last year, his share came out to $1,700. It has been known to climb as high as nearly $3,300.\nIn Ubud, Bali, Montgomery has been staying in the same guesthouse for the past decade for the low price of $25 a day. That amount includes breakfast.\nMeanwhile, the rent income from his house in Anchorage comes out to $110 per day.\nThe British-American expat\u2019s day in Bali begins at 7 a.m. with a hatha yoga session, followed by a workout in an air-conditioned gym. In the evenings, when the weather turns cooler, Montgomery enjoys an hour-long Balinese massage for just $20, including a generous tip.\n\u201cDuring my working career in Alaska, I never really enjoyed my winters. I just got through them,\u201d Montgomery admits. \u201cNow, I totally love my winters.\u201d\nEarly in his snowbirding experience, Montgomery would move far afield to explore far-flung places. But more recently, he says he has been going back to his favorite spots, including Bali and the South Island of New Zealand, where he keeps an old van in a friend\u2019s yard.\n\u201cI typically go to New Zealand for two to three months per year,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like Alaska, but when it\u2019s winter in Alaska, it\u2019s summer in New Zealand. It also has the advantage that I can hike in peace through the woods, confident that I am top of my food chain. The worst thing that will bite me is a sandfly.\u201d\nA major concern for the wilderness enthusiast in Alaska is becoming an alpha predator\u2019s meal.\n\u201cIt is a complete fallacy that Alaska bears will kill you and eat you. No. They bypass the killing and go straight to the eating,\u201d Montgomery quips. \u201cThe last sound you may hear is the crunching of your own bones! No such worries in New Zealand.\u201d\nThough he loves New Zealand, Montgomery says he views Bali as his true home away from home, as well as a convenient winter travel hub from where he can jet to Thailand or Singapore for as little as $100.\nThis spring, Montgomery\u2019s travels took him to Nepal, where he was preparing to go on a three-day white-water rafting trip, before flying back to Anchorage in late April.\n\u201cThis will be my 15th year of snowbirding, and I totally love it,\u201d he gushes.\nMontgomery is originally from England but moved to Alaska to attend graduate school inFairbanksin the late 1980s. After earning his MBA in 1991, he moved to Anchorage, got married, and embarked on a career in mortgage lending.\nAn avid outdoorsman, Montgomery fell in love with Alaska\u2019s wild, open spaces\u2014but not so much with its harsh winter weather, with average temperatures hovering in the teens and 20s.\n\u201cI totally love Alaska in the summertime. It\u2019s the size of Western Europe with the population one-twelfth of London,\u201d he says. \u201cThe wilderness adventure opportunities are just unbeatable.\u201d\nMontgomery has lived in Alaska for 38 years, but having to shiver through the frigid winter months never really agreed with him. So when he got the opportunity to retire from the mortgage origination industry at age 46, he jumped at the opportunity to revamp his lifestyle.\nMontgomery, now a widower, notes that he was able to \u201cstop chasing the dollar\u201d earlier than most of his colleagues because, unlike them, he had no children to care for, and he always strived to live below his means.\n\u201cI was able to recognize that I had enough and my time was more valuable to be,\u201d he says.\nInstead of springing for a fancy car, Montgomery continued driving his old Jeep while investing in a five-unit apartment building. Ten years later, the mortgage on the building has been paid off, and the income from the rentals now makes up the lion\u2019s share of Montgomery\u2019s retirement income. It also funds his jet-setting lifestyle.\nWhile he is enjoying a massage in Bali or exploring the temples of Thailand, Montgomery also draws another income from renting out his private home in Anchorage, which he had built in 2007. Between the upper-floor furnished unit and the granny flat he\u2019s got on his property, the retiree says he pulls in about $3,300 during the six months he\u2019s gone.\nMontgomery says he intends to keep up his globe-trotting for as long as his health allows.\n\u201cAs any flock of migrating birds can tell you: Don\u2019t overthink it,\u201d he says.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "People like Graham Boylan and his partner are supposed to be able to settle in Boston.They\u2019re both engineers. They make six-figure salaries, and Boylan works for a prominent technology company. And yet, every time they have searched for a home to buy over the past several years, they have come up empty-handed.Their first and biggest hurdle is the region\u2019s crushing house prices, which would see them pay $1 million for a small condominium in or around Cambridge, where they\u2019d like to live. Then there are interest rates, which at current levels would add thousands of dollars a month to their housing costs. And the fact is, there are very few places even available to buy right now. The homes they have toured always seem to be missing a non-negotiable feature, like accessible laundry.AdvertisementAll of that together has brought them to an uncomfortable realization.\u201cUnless it magically gets way cheaper, we can\u2019t really afford to buy here,\u201d said Boylan, who is 30. \u201cWhich feels completely insane given the fact that we objectively make more than a lot of people.\u201dSuch is the reality of Greater Boston\u2019s housing market, which has become so stratified in recent years that even people who may otherwise be considered wealthy can barely afford to buy here anymore.Spring is typically a busy time for homebuying. Sellers put their homes on the market as the ground thaws and trees begin to bud, and buyers tour open houses and make offers. Not in Greater Boston. Instead, the combination of sky-high prices and elevated interest rates are extending a three-year-long housing market malaise during which sellers simply haven\u2019t been putting their homes up for sale. Consider: Just 750 single-family homes across Greater Boston were listed for sale in February, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors, down 13 percent from last year and 34 percent from February 2020. And now? Deep uncertainty about the state of the economy and stock markets is sidelining even more would-be buyers and sellers alike.AdvertisementAdd it all up, and it feels like the gears of the housing market, which have already been turning slowly since interest rates rose in early 2022, have ground to a halt. And that has people like Boylan \u2014 and many, many people who are not well-paid tech workers \u2014 stuck in limbo.Graham Boylan in his home office in Cambridge. Despite earning a six-figure salary as an engineer, Boylan plans to leave the area after failing to find an affordable home to buy. Erin Clark/Globe StaffOf course, housing costs have been high in Greater Boston for decades. That\u2019s nothing new. But a wave of population growth in the 2010s, followed by a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, sent prices soaring, putting the region among the most expensive in the country. Between 2015 and 2024, home values in the region grew by nearly 50 percent, according to one key federal index.For most of that time, interest rates were historically low (the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dipped below 3 percent in the second half of 2020 and most of 2021); that kept buying within reach for many, at least relative to paying the region\u2019s steep rents, because it meant monthly house payments stayed relatively low.No longer. And it\u2019s not difficult to see why.In February 2021, when the median home price in Greater Boston was around $650,000, the monthly mortgage payment on that median-priced house was around $2,100, according to Bankrate\u2019s mortgage calculator. Four years later, the median-priced house costs $887,000, interest rates have roughly doubled, and that monthly payment has soared to $4,700. Late last week, the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage soared to 7 percent, according to Mortgage Daily News, driving that payment even higher.Advertisement\u201cWhat is staggering about what we\u2019re seeing now is that it wasn\u2019t by any stretch affordable to buy a home here before [interest rates rose],\u201d said Paul Willen, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. \u201cTypically, when you see rates go up like they did, you expect home prices to drop a bit. But it seems like no matter what happens prices go up in Boston.\u201dWhy? A seemingly endless shortage of supply, coupled with demand that never seems to fade.People still come in droves to open houses, said Mary Gillach, principal of the Gillach Group at William Raveis in Brookline. There is still intense demand for the homes that do go on the market, especially multimillion-dollar properties in Newton and other well-off western suburbs, because their buyers can afford to buy despite unfavorable economic conditions and probably aren\u2019t borrowing much or at all.But for most everyone else, today\u2019s housing market is mostly untenable. Melvin Vieira Jr., an agent at the Re/Max Real Estate Group in Jamaica Plain, sees the current state of the market like this: interest rates have sidelined many would-be sellers, because they have a low mortgage rate now and don\u2019t want to pay a higher rate on their next house. That means there\u2019s little supply going on the market and because prices are so high and demand so intense, many buyers are sidelined, too. Buying can be manageable here when you\u2019re putting up a big down payment and keeping monthly costs low, said Vieira Jr. But the combination of both high down payments and high monthly costs push buying out of reach for most people.AdvertisementAnd now, Vieira Jr. said, he has clients who were finally ready to stomach both after three years of waiting for interest rates to fall, but are now pulling back because of volatility in the economy.Buying a home is a huge investment, said Gillach, in many cases the biggest someone will ever make. It is not difficult to understand, she said, why wild swings in the markets caused by a trade war that may drive up the cost of living would give people pause. With so much in flux \u2014 like 401ks and long-term investments \u2014 buying a home can go from something that feels like a safe investment to a huge risk.Real estate agent Rosanne Coric walks through the master bedroom of a home in Newton during a recent open house.Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\u201cI was here for 9/11, and while that was a national tragedy, it had a similar effect, where nobody wanted to make such a major decision because they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen in their lives,\u201d said Gillach. \u201cIt\u2019s this massive uncertainty that naturally leads to \u2018I don\u2019t know if I want to commit to that house.\u2018\u201dThe most vexing part of the housing market\u2019s current logjam is that there is no immediate path out of it, said Viera Jr., no indication that interest rates will fall and no sign of prices in Greater Boston going anywhere but up. Now the cost of many building materials is expected to increase, which may push prices even higher.Advertisement\u201cWe are looking for a little glimmer of hope, or for the door to be cracked open just a little bit,\u201d said Viera. \u201cUsually you can find that somewhere with prices or rates. But honestly, the door is not cracked at all right now.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.",

Randall went into early retirement in the \u201990s, before AIG played a significant role in the onset of the Great Recession in the following decade.\nRackson told Mansion Global that the roof was gone when he nabbed the home in 1999, with rats and pigeons already in residence. Rackson paid $1.4 million, according to StreetEasy. He then set about restoring the facade and interiors to their Gilded Age glory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s livable, it\u2019s not museum-like,\u201d Rackson told the outlet.\nRackson could not be reached for comment.\nAdvertisement",

We don\u2019t see the sky; we don\u2019t see the stars. We\u2019re not reminded of a relationship with the universe.\u201d\nHenes saw her role as a bridge between modern urban life and primal human instincts, drawing from diverse spiritual traditions like Hinduism, Native American practices and Judaism to highlight shared celebrations of light and renewal.\nIn 1975, Henes said she underwent a revelation when a friend gave her a Native American weaving, and she placed it over her face.\n\u201cI instantly understood how everything in the world was interconnected,\u201d she told The Times.\nDespite occasional clashes with authorities \u2014 such as a 1998 arrest for trespassing during a solstice event, later dismissed \u2014 she remained committed to fostering reverence for the universe. Beyond rituals, Henes taught in New York public schools, wrote books and crafted personal ceremonies for life\u2019s milestones.\nNow her surviving partner, Kaplan, is parting ways with the home they have owned since 1989.\nThe top-floor co-op, part of the P.S. 9 Annex designed by James W. Naughton in the Renaissance Revival style, features 14-foot vaulted ceilings, exposed brick archways and nine skylights that flood the space with light.\nTwo woodburning fireplaces anchor flexible living areas, while a windowed kitchen and two private terraces provide open city views.\nThe layout, currently a three-bedroom, three-bathroom configuration, could be reimagined as a grand residential showpiece or an artistic live/work haven, the listing notes.\nThe school was built in 1895 to address overcrowding at the original school due to Prospect Heights\u2019 growing population.\nIt was later converted to residential by local artists, the listing said.\nAn H-shaped brick building, it features gable dormer windows and blends Romanesque Revival with Renaissance Revival architectural elements.\nThe repurposed apartments are now called, simply \u201cP.S. 9.\u201d\nThe building sits at the corner of Sterling Place and Vanderbilt Avenue, exuding a stately presence.\nResidents enjoy a lush communal garden, gated private parking (a rarity in Brooklyn), and a visiting superintendent.\nRichard Orenstein and Lawrence Kieran of Brown Harris Stevens hold the listing.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "It\u2019s 2025, and we\u2019re still trying to make third spaces happen. Or, at least,Brooklyn Crossingis. The luxury apartment building inProspect Heights, Brooklyn, NYis now offeringtenantsan allowance to host more get-togethers as an incentive to build community inside its walls.\nBrooklyn Crossing already comes stacked with amenities: arooftop pool, a 5,200-square-footgym, and even a vending machine where you can rent a Dyson vacuum\u2014all starting at $4,025 a month for a one-bedroom. That rate is a paltry $1,048 above New York City\u2019s median rent, per the latestRental ReportfromRealtor.com\u00ae.\nAnd while perks like pools and Pelotons were once the crown jewels of amenity packages, more buildings are now betting that \u201ccommunity\u201d is what sells. From co-hosted events to curated social programming, landlords are marketing connection as a building\u2019s biggest value-add\u2014suggesting that what tenants really want, in addition to central air and skyline views, is a sense of belonging.\nBrooklyn Crossing isn\u2019t alone in this shift. The building\u2019s push to foster curated connection reflects a growing trend across the rental market: Social amenities are becoming just as important as the physical ones.\nAmericans aremoving less than they everhave before, putting more pressure on the moves they actually do make. Instead of treating apartments as temporary landing pads, renters are increasingly seeking spaces where they can put down roots\u2014and developers are taking notice.\nBut this isn\u2019t just about upping the amenity ante. It\u2019s a response to deeper shifts in how\u2014and where\u2014people build community. In a post-pandemic world of hybrid work and rising loneliness, apartments aren\u2019t just where we sleep. They\u2019re where we work, socialize, and build lives. And in cities where homeownership is out of reach for many, renters are craving permanence and belonging in spaces they don\u2019t technically own.\nSocial amenities promise a kind of shortcut to that elusive feeling of home. The idea is: If the building provides the infrastructure\u2014event budgets, shared spaces, even a resident experience coordinator\u2014then residents won\u2019t have to do the hard work of community-building from scratch.\nThere\u2019s data to back this up. Socialization with local friends and neighbors is one of the biggest drivers of people staying put in their chosen neighborhood, according to a2024 studywhich examined residential mobility in Oslo, Norway. Even in the U.S., where residential turnover is common, property managers have found that tenant-hosted events canimprove retention and reduce churn.\nFor developers, the math is simple: Connection isn\u2019t just nice to have\u2014it\u2019s profitable.\nBut what does this social engineering look like in practice?\nBrooklyn Crossing\u2019s version of curated community comes via theBrodsky Organization\u2019s \u201cNeighborly Events\u201d program. Tenants can receive Visa gift cards to partially reimburse the cost of social gatherings\u2014as long as they\u2019re willing to provide receipts, upload a few photos, and post about it on the building\u2019s internal message board,Curbedreports. The aim is to make it easier\u2014and maybe a little more affordable\u2014for residents to mingle with the people they share walls and elevators with.\nAcross Brodsky\u2019s portfolio ofhigh-end rentals, events range from regular Saturday yoga at City Tower to Tiny Tunes music class for children atWest End Towersto one-off seasonal outings.\nSome events are hosted by the property itself; others are organized by tenants with the help of the events stipend, which has covered up to $500 for a single gathering. It\u2019s socializing, but with receipts\u2014and a reminder that even in the friendliest version of luxury living, connection is still something of a transaction.\nThis strategy reflects a larger truth about modern renting: People crave connection, but often don\u2019t have the time, energy, or infrastructure to create it on their own. And for buildings vying to stand out in a market flooded with similar amenities, offering a plug-and-play social life complete with budgeting support might just be the edge that seals the lease.\nIf curated connection is the amenity you\u2019re after, start by looking for buildings that promote resident events or list \u201ccommunity programming\u201d among their features, like1515 SurfinBrooklyn, NY. These offerings may not always be front and center in a rental listing, so dig into the property\u2019s website or ask the leasing office directly: Do you host regular events? Is there a tenant budget for gatherings? Are there shared spaces built for actual use\u2014not just glossy photos?\nTerms like \u201cresident experience manager,\u201d \u201cneighbor events,\u201d or even \u201cco-living inspired\u201d can hint at efforts to build community beyond the boilerplate amenity list. And don\u2019t underestimate the power of old-fashioned observation\u2014if the building has a calendar of events in the lobby or a bulletin board filled with recent photos, like333 Schermerhorndoes,chances are they\u2019re not just paying lip service to social connection.\nOf course, no amount of free ros\u00e9 or reimbursed pizza parties can guarantee real friendship. But for renters hoping their next apartment might also come with a little more belonging, buildings like360 Wytheare offering a pitch that goes beyond square footage: Stay here, and you might find your people.\nAllaire Conte is a senior advice writer covering real estate and personal finance trends.

Another 4,569 units are in the pipeline for completion.\nThe proposed boost in residential construction is part of a targeted, neighborhood-wide zoning overhaul by the Adams administration that, if given the green light, would allow for more high-rise apartment buildings, as well as mixed-use developments.\nThe zoning changes could result in as many as 14,000 new homes.\nLong Island City is the fifth neighborhood-specific zoning proposal pushed by Adams, preceded by proposals forMidtown South, Jamaica, Atlantic Avenue and two East Bronx neighborhoods.\nThe Long Island City Neighborhood plan would allow for denser housing along the waterfront and construction further inland to Court Square.\nProposed changes include high-rises east of NYCHA\u2019s Queensbridge Houses, Gothamist reported.\nThe rezoning also includes the warehouse-laden stretch of 44th Drive, encompassing the site once destined to become part of Amazon\u2019s doomed \u201cHQ2.\u201d\nLocal residents have their gripes about the ongoing boom, however.

Chastain, 48, bought the storied unit for $5.1 million in 2015. The \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d actressattempted to sell last Mayfor $7.45 million before pulling the listing in February.\nNow it\u2019s back on the market for a slightly softer $6.49 million, according to a Monday evening StreetEasy listing update.\nThe 3,200-square-foot residence was previously featured in Architectural Digest and renovated by AD100 designers Carrier and Company.\u00a0Modern amenities and a fresh color palette contrast with restored turn-of-the-century details, including oak parquet floors, crown moldings and carved doorways.\nThe home remains in the same state as it was when listing photos were last obtained in 2024, when a different luxury brokerage represented it. Two formal living rooms boast mahogany paneling, 14-foot ceilings and a bay window with Tiffany Studio-created leaded glass transoms.\nThe primary bedroom includes a copper soaking tub and a wall of mirrored closets. It also enjoys one of the apartment\u2019s five woodburning fireplaces.\nThe home\u2019s L-shaped floor plan also includes secondary bedrooms and a library.\nChastain isn\u2019t the first famous artist to pass through the home\u2019s mahogany halls. Chastain bought the home in 2015 from another composer, Adam Guettel \u2014 the grandson of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d composer Richard Rodgers.\nChastain moved into the Osborne on the heels of her box-office successes in \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d in 2012 and \u201cInterstellar\u201d in 2014. She would go on to win an Academy Award for best actress for her work in the 2022 film \u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye.\u201d\nCarl Gambino of Compass is now repping the listing.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s notoriously expensive housing market is becoming less about buying and more about bequeathing \u2014 as affluent parents increasingly use trusts to gift homes to their children.\nIn 2024, trusts powered 28% of home sales in the borough, a steep climb from 17% three years earlier, data from real estate analytics firm Attom reveals.\n\u201cThese clients want to avoid tax ramifications with their purchase and be discreet with their spending,\u201d Frances Katzen, a Douglas Elliman luxury broker toldBloomberg,and she estimated 40% of her parent-driven sales last year involved trusts.\nSkyrocketing prices, new tax maneuvers and the dawn of a $100 trillion generational wealth transfer are fueling the shift, according to the outlet.\nWith Manhattan\u2019s median home price hitting $1.1 million last year and cash deals dominating over 60% of sales, according to Miller Samuel Inc., even high earners \u2014 like doctors pulling in $350,000 \u2014 find themselves priced out of the market.\n\u201cOne sort of change that\u2019s coming out of the pandemic are parents who, instead of saving [homes] for when they pass, they give it to their kids while they\u2019re still alive to give them something now to help them,\u201d appraiser Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel, told The Post.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be self made and buy property without generational wealth,\u201d Peter Zaitzeff, a Serhant agent told Bloomberg, who recently closed a $4 million Central Park West apartment deal for a client\u2019s son via a trust. \u201cYou need to make or have a lot of money to be here.\u201d\nBut, according to Miller, not all who use a trust are parents passing down their homes to their children.\u00a0Indeed, the Attom figures may include trust purchases other than parents buying homes for their children.\nTrusts are the go-to tool for savvy buyers, offering tax breaks and a veil of privacy. They can slash estate taxes after a homeowner\u2019s passing, sidestep gift tax hurdles, and, unlike LLCs, maintain some anonymity despite new transparency rules. After Gov. Kathy Hochul tightened the LLC Transparency Act last year, requiring owner disclosures, brokers report a rush to trusts among the wealthy.\n\u201cWith the crackdown on LLCs through the US Treasury over the last decade, every year seemingly more restrictive, we are seeing a shift to the use of trusts,\u201d Miller said. \u201cTrusts\u00a0serve many purposes. Enabling an easier transfer of wealth through real estate is certainly one of them. But there\u2019s still plenty of other uses for it, like maintaining privacy and managing tax exposure, which are not just used by parents. The concerns about LLCs being a key indicator.\u201d\n\u201cThere are certainly many creative uses for trusts that provide privacy tax advantages,\u201d Miller added.\nBeyond taxes, trusts shield assets from creditors, lawsuits or messy divorces, appealing to entrepreneurs and high-stakes professionals. Unlike LLCs, which are business-focused, trusts are built for legacy planning, naming beneficiaries to inherit the keys.\n\u201cIndeed, there are further factors at play,\u201d said New York-based family lawyer Yonatan Levoritz, founder ofthe Levoritz Law Firm. \u201cThere\u2019s been a notable resurgence of foreign buyers re-entering the New York market, coupled with high-net-worth individuals seeking more stable investment opportunities. With alternative markets like Florida becoming increasingly expensive, these investors are turning to New York, thereby contributing to the growing trend of trust usage.\u201d\nThe trend is reshaping Manhattan\u2019s coolest corners. Attom data shows a third of trust-bought condos in 2024 landed in chic spots like Soho, Tribeca and the West Village, where average sales topped $3 million, per Douglas Elliman. These areas, once the domain of seasoned tycoons, now buzz with younger faces.\n\u201cIn areas like the West Village, there used to only be older people who were wealthy,\u201d Zaitzeff said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all 20 year olds whose parents bought them a place.\u201d\nWith baby boomers poised to pass down vast fortunes, analysts see no slowdown ahead.\nNew York\u2019s 350,000 millionaires \u2014 and counting \u2014 ensure luxury real estate stays a hot ticket for heirs, per Knight Frank. Chayce Horton, a senior analyst at Cerulli Associates, predicts trusts will only grow in popularity as families navigate this wealth wave.\n\u201cComing out of the pandemic, the surge in wealth, the expansion of the wealth gap has probably facilitated this legal mechanism more than a typical year,\u201d Miller told The Post. \u201cThe last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous increase in wealth and this just happens to be a vehicle that works \u2014 a legal vehicle that works for enabling parents to help their children buy real estate. But by no means is it the only use of this vehicle, which has been around a long time.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "An Upper East Side residence steeped in literary lore, once the hub of writer George Plimpton\u2019s social and professional world, is poised to list for $5.25 million, The Post has learned.\nThe sprawling 4,700-square-foot duplex at 541 E. 72nd St. \u2014 where Plimpton, the storied co-founder of the Paris Review literary magazine, and his wife, Sarah Dudley Plimpton, lived for nearly six decades \u2014 offers a rare chance to own a piece of New York\u2019s cultural history.\nSpecifically, an era when writers, artists and luminaries gathered behind its door.\nNestled among the distinctive \u201cBlack and Whites\u201d row houses, known for their striking two-tone facades and lipstick-red doors, the five-bedroom, 6.5-bath property occupies a quiet cobblestone enclave overlooking the East River.\nOriginally constructed in 1894 as tenements, these buildings were transformed in the 1930s by architects Sacchetti & Siegal into elegant residences, a shift spurred by the area\u2019s growing allure for Manhattan\u2019s elite.\n\u201cOriginally a working-class neighborhood, by the 1920s, it became fashionable to live along the East River,\u201d said Lisa Gustin, of Douglas Elliman, who represents the listing alongside Whitney Mogavero.\nThe duplex, a composite of four apartments merged by the Plimpton family, retains vestiges of its storied past.\nThree fireplaces \u2014 adorned with mahogany mantels, marble surrounds and intricate tilework \u2014 anchor the home\u2019s historic character.\nYet the residence has evolved with contemporary upgrades: soundproofed windows, ductless air conditioning, freshly painted walls, new carpeting and updated lighting.\nMost of all, the home was a stage for cultural giants.\n\u201cThe duplex has been the site of legendary parties back in the day, which drew the likes of Truman Capote, Paul McCartney, Andy Warhol and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to name a few,\u201d Mogavero said.\n\u201cOther famous friends and neighbors of George Plimpton included Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Robert F. Kennedy and Warren Beatty.\u201d\nThe Paris Review, launched by Plimpton in the 1950s, also operated from these walls, publishing early works by Jack Kerouac and Philip Roth while featuring interviews with literary titans like Ernest Hemingway. Plimpton died in 2003 at the age of 76 from a heart attack.\n\u201cTrue American icons, from the literary elite to Who\u2019s Who of NYC society, have graced this home over the past six decades\u201d Mogavero said.\nThe layout is as grand as its history. A gracious foyer leads to a double living room, its river views framed by expansive windows, ideal for entertaining as it was in Plimpton\u2019s day.\nThe kitchen, equipped with a FiveStar range, Bosch appliances, and a Sub-Zero refrigerator, flows into a casual dining area and a butler\u2019s pantry.\nUpstairs, four bedrooms \u2014 three with private baths \u2014 include a corner primary suite with built-ins and serene water views.\nA wood-paneled study and a den with another fireplace add warmth, while a full laundry room completes the floor.\nThe decision to sell comes as Sarah Plimpton relocates.\n\u201cGeorge Plimpton\u2019s widow, Sarah Plimpton, has moved away to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Their children are all grown and out of the home, so this iconic residence is now ready for its next chapter,\u201d Gustin said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The mysterious disappearance of a luxury Hamptons beach cottage, nearly 100 years old and abutting an ultra-exclusive golf course country getaway, has been solved.\nA British real estate mogul pulled off the secret, off-market purchase of a $12 million \u201cfairy tale\u201d country-style cottage that was built in the early 20th century and overlooked the tony Maidstone Club in East Hampton.\nBut instead of moving into the charming five-bedroom \u201crelic,\u201d with exposed beams inspired by the English arts and crafts-style country homes,\u00a0the buyers\u00a0tore\u00a0it down one February day.\n\u201cOne day they [the neighbors] woke up, and the house was gone!\u201d said Douglas Elliman top broker Paul Brennan, who repped the buyer and seller with fellow Elliman broker Martha Gundersen.\nThe buyers, sources said, are Laura and\u00a0Nick Capstick-Dale, who are currently listed on the Sunday Times Rich List 2024 at around $614 million. The Capstick-Dales bought the home via the\u00a0Jaroff Revocable Trust.\nThe plan, sources told Gimme Shelter, is to build a larger, traditional \u201cdream\u201d home almost double the size, on prestigious Further Lane.\nWhen reached in the Atlas Mountains outside Marrakech, Morocco, Nick Capstick-Dale confirmed the news.\n\u201cWe had been looking for a home overlooking the Maidstone with ocean and sunset views for some time. It\u2019s our favorite view in the Hamptons, and we also wanted to be close to the village, having had a home on Egypt Lane for 14 years,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s spent a total of 20 summers in East Hampton. \u201cThe homes that overlook the Maidstone Club are generational and seldom come to the market, so we feel really lucky.\u201d\nThe home will be built by Ben Krupinski Builders, which crafted their previous Egypt Lane residence \u2014 and will be some 11,500 square feet.\nCapstick-Dale added that they are buidling their \u201cforever home, hence tearing down the existing home to build a new one that suited our lifestyle with three children. We are building a traditional house that will hopefully blend into the landscape like it had been there always, something we care deeply about.\u201d\nThe stealth off-market deal is the talk of the East End. The Captstick-Dales\u2019 new neighbors include New York Jets co-owner Robert Wood (\u201cWoody\u201d) Johnson IV, who was ambassador to the UK from 2017 to 2021 and also a member of the Maidstone Club.\n\u201cThey are staying in the area because they know it is as close to the British countryside as one can get on this side of the pond,\u201d a source said.\nThe seller was the Mary Kay Jaroff Trust. The land, which adjoins the Maidstone Club, boasts stunning sunset views of Hook Pond and the ocean.\nThe former home was 6,000 square feet while the new home will be nearly double the size \u2014 all on 1.16 acres with landscaped gardens, sources told Gimme. They add that the new home will be a \u201ctasteful, traditional-style shingle gambrel that will blend seamlessly into the surrounding grand estates.\u201d\nThe home quietly went into contract in 2024 and closed last November \u201call without a whisper,\u201d Brennan added. \u201cThe end result will be stunning.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

The listing describes the property as a \u201ccontemporary waterfront oasis\u201d that \u201cblends cutting-edge design with natural tranquility.\u201dThe property sits on 12.7 acres near the Concord River. It also abuts approximately 35 acres of conservation land, making it a \u201csuper private\u201d location, according to listing agent Michael Carucci.The property was first listed two weeks ago, Carucci said Tuesday. Built in 1992, it includes five bedrooms, five full bathrooms, a basement media room, a wine cellar, a personal gym and sauna, and an outdoor plunge pool.The living room of the Concord home that once belonged to Kevin Garnett. Gibson SothebysGarnett bought the home in 2007, around the time he was traded to the Celtics from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Carucci said.

He noted at the time that his family had \u201cdedicated a lot of time and effort to incorporate our own personal touches.\u201dHe ultimately sold the home for $3.635 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.Enormous windows frame a seating area in the Concord home.

        "content": "Livestream: Karen Read back in court for final hearing before retrial\nByMegan Johnson\nIf your real estate taste leans more spooky than stylish, the legendary S.K. Pierce Mansion in Gardner is officially on the market for $1.2 million.\nThe nine-bed, three-and-a-half-bath home at 4 West Broadway, which is zoned for residential or commercial occupancy, was built in 1875 in the Second Empire style. But it\u2019s the haunted happenings that lure paranormal enthusiasts from around the globe to Gardner and score the home plenty of attention these days.\n\u201cThere are two different kinds of people that go in,\u201d saidBrenda Albertof LAER Realty Partners, who has thelisting. \u201cThere are people who are there to see the woodwork and the detail, and then there are those who are looking for the haunted factor.\u201d\nBefore the property became known as a hotspot for paranormal investigators andhaunted house enthusiasts, it was the home of Sylvester Knowlton Pierce, who rose to success in Gardner as the man behind SK Pierce Co., a prominent chair manufacturing company. According to historic documents, the property became a gathering place for his notable friends, including showman P.T. Barnum, who \u201cvisited the mansion every time he visited Massachusetts and spent much time playing billiards with Mr. Pierce on the third floor.\u201d\nAfter Pierce\u2019s death, the property had several uses, including an inn that welcomed visitors including President Calvin Coolidge, Norman Rockwell, Milton Hershey, and Bette Davis. By the time the Depression hit, it became a boarding house.\nThese days, you\u2019re more likely to recognize it from various ghost-obsessed television programs, like \u201cGhost Adventures,\u201d which featured the property in a2013 episode. It\u2019s known for several unsavory historic rumors, ranging from murders and prostitution to a man spontaneously combusting. (There\u2019s even abookwritten about all the creepy tales that took place inside.)\nNow sitting on the National Register of Historic Places, the mansion functions as a haunted attraction drawing people from across the world. But it could easily function as anything from a bed and breakfast to an event space. Sitting on a corner lot, the property welcomes you with 11-foot ceilings and plenty of historic grandeur. While the home maintains its traditional features, recent updates allow it to function\u00a0in the modern world.\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, they made this house turnkey,\u201d Albert said. \u201cNew heating systems, AC on the top floor, new kitchen, new electrical, new plumbing. They took this house to the point that now it\u2019s completely turnkey.\u201d\nIf you are eager to snag the home, get ready for visitors to come by: It\u2019s already booked for tours through Halloween.\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

Warm wood paneling covers the interiors and the fixtures look unchanged since the home arrived in 1999. At just $185,000, it\u2019s also what the OutEast listings portal shows as the least expensive home for sale in the region \u2014 which has long been known as the summer playground for the wealthy and otherwise famous.\n\u201cIt\u2019s proof that affordable Hamptons living is still possible,\u201d Douglas Elliman agent Viviana Smith told The Post in a statement. Smith holds the listing alongside Elliman agent Richard Connelly.\nThe prefab interiors include a kitchen, a living room, two bedrooms and one bathroom. The home is in clear need of TLC, with an outdated color palette, yellowing blinds and a beige carpet that\u2019s seen better days.\nThis trailer is just a one-hour drive away fromMontauk Shores, a no-frills waterfront trailer park in Montauk where similarly sized homeslist in the million-dollar range.

        "content": "No jokes here: Bill Cosby\u2019s stately Upper East Side brownstone has quietly been listed for just under $7 million.\nThe four-story residence, on East 61st Street, offers six bedrooms, an elevator and a formal dining room warmed by a fireplace \u2014 as well as the weight of a contentious foreclosure dispute,Crain\u2019s reported.\nThe 5,000-square-foot home is thecenterpiece of a lawsuitfiled in Manhattan Supreme Court, where lender CitiMortgage alleges the Cosbys defaulted on a 2010 loan and now owe more than $4.2 million in outstanding principal, interest and fees.\nIn a February filing, Cosby\u2019s legal team pushed back, arguing that the lender\u2019s calculations were incorrect and the debt overstated.\nCosby, 87, and his wife, Camille, purchased the home in 1980, according to public records.\nThough the purchase price remains unavailable, the property\u2019s history is steeped in personal significance.\nIt was once home to their son, Ennis, a Columbia University alumnus who was murdered in Los Angeles in 1997.\nJoseph Jacobson of the Biolsi Law Group, representing Cosby in the foreclosure case, declined to elaborate on the decision to list the East 61st Street property while litigation is ongoing.\nThe listing, quietly posted this week, emphasizes the property\u2019s location on a landmarked block steps from Second Avenue. Showings are limited to private appointments.\nThis is not the only real estate headache facing the Cosbys.\nAnother foreclosure caseis underway involving their principal Manhattan residence, a grand Beaux-Arts townhouse on East 71st Street.\nThere, First Foundation Bank alleges the couple defaulted on a $17.5 million loan tied to the 12,000-square-foot mansion, which they reportedly acquired in 1987 for about $6 million. That case, too, is active in state court.\nWhile both properties remain in legal limbo, only the East 61st Street brownstone has officially hit the market.\nThe former television star, once celebrated as America\u2019s dad, has seen his public image and finances battered over the last decade.\nIn 2018, he was convicted in Pennsylvania on sexual assault charges stemming from a 2004 incident and sentenced to up to a decade in prison. That convictionwas overturned in 2021by the state\u2019s Supreme Court on due process grounds.\nDespite the legal reversal, dozens of women have come forward with allegations spanning decades \u2014 claims that Cosby has consistently denied.\nAdvertisement",

I always kind of loved this neighborhood,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s also where he met his wife, Megan, back when she worked at an Upper East Side art gallery.\nHe also loves to do live comedy shows in New York and hosts his podcast, \u201cJoy, a Podcast. Hosted by Craig Ferguson,\u201d in person with his one-on-one guest format.\n\u201cIf you want to do a podcast in person, you kind of have to go to where people live, and that\u2019s one of the many reasons why we moved back to New York,\u201d Ferguson said.\nLike all New Yorkers, Ferguson has his favorite neighborhood food haunts. In his case, that means the not-so-fancy-fancy Three Guys diner and Nectar on Madison Avenue, as well as Saba\u2019s Pizza on Lexington.\nLast August, Ferguson sold his 13-bedroom castle in Ayrshire, Scotland, for around $5.3 million within weeks of listing it,the Daily Mail reported. The couple had bought it in 2021, and it came with a five-bedroom coach house and three smaller cottages \u2014 and 1.8 miles of salmon and trout fishing.\nFerguson also sold a second Scottish estate.\u00a0Then, with his youngest child in high school, it was time, he said, to return to New York.\nFerguson was repped in the New York apartment transaction by Corcoran\u2019s Gino Filippone, who said he was under strict instructions to limit the house hunt to a five-block radius, from Fifth to Madison and Park avenues, and never farther east.\nThe family\u2019s new home boasts original prewar details like hardwood floors and moldings. It opens to a large foyer with a mural painted by the studioHappy Menocal.\u00a0There\u2019s also a large living and dining area plus a study on one side and a windowed kitchen on the other.\u00a0The bedrooms share a bath.\nThe listing broker was Ria Browne of Compass.\nFerguson hosted \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d for nearly a decade and quit in December of 2014.\nNow, he said, he\u2019s thrilled to be back in New York and testing out new material and performing.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nDo you feel stuck in your home?\nPerhaps you purchased what you thought was a starter home, but when you tried to buy a bigger place, you discovered you were priced out of the market. Considering that the median sales price of a single-family home in Greater Boston was$883,000 in February 2025\u2014 up almost 13 percent year-over-year, according to theGreater Boston Association of Realtors\u2014 many wannabe move-up buyers are finding themselves stuck at home.\n\u201cHome prices are only getting more expensive, and the [mortgage] rates haven\u2019t dropped, so a lot of homeowners are trapped,\u201d saidMorgan Franklin, a real estate agent withColdwell Banker Realtyin Boston. \u201cThey might be younger couples who maybe went from one child to two or three, and they now need more space.\u201d\nLuckily, there are relatively low-cost improvements that can make a big difference in your home \u2014 to refresh it, make it more livable, and enhance your enjoyment of the space until the time comes \u2014 if it does \u2014 to move into a larger place.\nPatrick Hope, 45, purchased a two-bedroom, one-and-one-half-bath home in Medway in August 2012, paying $270,000 and financing it with a 3.5 percent mortgage. At first, Hope\u2019s two sons were sharing a bedroom. As they got older, the boys needed more privacy.\nHope considered moving, but interest rates and prices had risen substantially in surrounding neighborhoods. So, Hope invested $130,000 into improving his 1,291-square-foot home, building a 500-square-foot addition with two additional bedrooms. He also replaced the roof and siding.\n\u201cIt allowed for personal space for the kids, which freed up some of the downstairs living space,\u201d said Hope, who works in product marketing for a tech company. \u201cI don\u2019t see the market changing any time soon, so I built the house I wanted instead of buying something else.\u201d\nJasmine Edo, 34, lives in a 950-square-foot condominium in Revere on the second floor of the building, but would like to have a backyard for her dog to enjoy. She purchased her home in September 2020 for $285,000, but due to the high housing costs and her 3.5 percent mortgage rate, she felt stuck.\n\u201cMy only option was to make the place more livable, to upgrade,\u201d said Edo, a wealth planner.\nShe invested about $5,000 to repaint, replace a sliding glass door, upgrade the electrical system, and replace ceiling fans and light fixtures. Now she\u2019s saving for larger projects, like new floors and a new kitchen and bathroom.\n\u201cYou just have to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to enjoy the space you live in, so whatever you need to do to make it better for you, just make it happen.\u201d\nLee Bardin, owner ofExpert Renovation Teamin Newton, said there are many projects homeowners can make to create more usable space if they are stuck in a small home.\nFinishing a basement, for example, typically costs $20,000 to $25,000, he said. Due to code requirements, he recommends using that space as a home office or gym, not a bedroom.\nConverting a porch into a finished den would typically run $25,000 to $30,000, he said, and minor updates to a kitchen, such as cabinet refacing ($8,000), new quartz countertops ($5,000), and a tile backsplash ($2,500) could significantly enhance the room.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "\nThese English villagers are not too chuffed with Kelsey Grammer\u2019s plans to tear down a 200-year-old cottage.\nThe actor, known for his portrayal of the acerbic psychiatrist Fraiser Crane on the sitcoms \u201cCheers\u201d and \u201cFraiser,\u201d purchased a historic English cottage in 2023.\nAnd now, Grammer\u2019s new plans to level the property have sparked local ire, according to SWNS.\nGrammer, 70, bought the home in 2023 with his wife, Kayte Wash, 46, to be closer to her family in Bristol.\nThe two-bedroom stone cottage\u00a0boasts views of the Bristol Channel, across to the Welsh Coast. Pastlisting materialsadvertise the home as containing two to three bedrooms across 1,828 square feet, plus a 332-square-foot garage.\nPlanners at North Somerset Council recently gave Grammer the green light to demolish the cottage and build a four-bedroom modern home, with a game room and a gym.\nGrammer\u2019s plans to level the seaside home has attracted the ire of local residents and eight letters to the local council objecting to their decision.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s such a shame because it\u2019s a beautiful building with character, it\u2019s old and it\u2019s part of the community,\u201d local resident Wendy Osment, 74,told SWNS.\n\u201cPeople have already taken a couple of the old cottages down.\u201d\nOsment told SWNS that her grandchildren cannot afford to live near her, as wealthy buyers have driven up property values.\nOthers have not minced words. One 76-year-old localspeaking to The Telegraphcalled the planned demolition \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\nThe local Parish Council called the cottage a \u201chistoric icon,\u201d along the coastal Down Road, SWNS reported.\nSusan Smart, 76, who lives in a trailer park in Walton Bay, said the change wouldn\u2019t bother her much, but there\u2019s already been a lot of change in the community.\n\u201cI would like it to stay like that but unfortunately I think in this climate people have got the money, they buy houses and do things you\u2019re only able to do if you\u2019ve got the money to pay for it,\u201d Smart told SWNS.\n\u201cI just hope it\u2019s in keeping with the other houses that have been done,\u201d Smart said. \u201cThree properties have been knocked down over the past year.\u201d\nGrammer applied last year to build a large extension onto the home, but his bid was rejected. The expansion would have demolished 1980s-era extensions on three sides of the cottage\u00a0and added a larger addition up to twice the size of the original building, plus a new basement.\nThat bid was denied by the council, but the actor evidently has no legal impediment to completely knocking down the home.\nGrammer is yet to respond to the negative reception of his plans, but the council requires his demolition to begin on or before February 2030.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "He wasn\u2019t lovin\u2019 it.\nFor Keith Richardson, a retired educator from Southern California, the allure of a new life in Italy hinged on a specific condition: nary a McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks in sight.\nThese global chains, to him, represented the American commercial sprawl he sought to leave behind,he told CNN Travelin an interview.\nAfter a meticulous search, he settled on Nard\u00f2, a tranquil town in Puglia, the rural region forming the heel of Italy\u2019s boot, where he acquired a historic home for a fraction of US prices \u2014 embracing a slower, more authentic existence.\nRichardson, who spent decades in the education system before retiring in 2015 as a high school district administrator, had long been captivated by Italy.\nHis passion for languages \u2014 honed while teaching Spanish at a university \u2014 drew him to the country, where he traveled biannually, exploring its regions by rental car.\nBy 2023, his focus narrowed to Puglia, prized for its unspoiled beaches and low-key charm.\n\u201cPuglia is definitely the place to live and invest in, if you\u2019re searching for that dolce vita coastal lifestyle,\u201d he told CNN.\nAn expat friend connected him with a US-based real estate consultant in Puglia, who steered him toward Nard\u00f2, a lesser-known gem in the Salento area, free of American fast-food outlets.\n\u201cI gave her a list of homes I like,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cShe suggested including Nard\u00f2 because I told her that I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near a McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks.\u201d\nAfter browsing online listings, he zeroed in on a 667-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom ground-floor property, once servant quarters in the storied Palazzo Tafuri.\nThe home, built with Puglia\u2019s signature pinkish-golden stone, had been fully renovated \u2014 boasting limestone walls, a fireplace and ornate stellar ceilings. Listed at $153,000, Richardson made a bold move.\n\u201cThe house was listed for 138,000 euros ($153,000) but I negotiated and paid \u20ac100,000 ($111,000). I put in another 3,800 euros to restyle it to my liking and give it a fresh look,\u201d he told CNN.\n\u201cI was willing to pay more, but started at 100,000 euros to see if the sellers would counter offer.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t, and the deal was sealed in March 2024, days after he arrived from Orange County.\nFor Richardson, the purchase was a steal compared with Southern California\u2019s skyrocketing real estate.\n\u201cHomes in Southern California within 3 miles from the coast, in such a desired area, would cost anywhere from $700,000 to $1.4 million,\u201d he noted.\nHis only modifications were a permanent patio roof and bamboo privacy screens, minor expenses for a property he sees as a remarkable value.\nNard\u00f2\u2019s appeal lies in its understated elegance and distance from mass tourism. Far from Italy\u2019s crowded hotspots, it offers proximity to the crystalline beaches of the Salento coast, often dubbed \u201cItaly\u2019s Maldives.\u201d\nThe town\u2019s historic center, with its grand churches and ornate palazzos, surrounds Richardson\u2019s new home, steps from Piazza Salandra\u2019s lively caf\u00e9 terraces. The ground-floor layout, free of the steep staircases common in Italy\u2019s older properties, added practicality for his retirement years.\nThe lifestyle in Puglia evokes nostalgia for Richardson.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reminiscent of Southern California in the 1960s,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember as a child passing through orange groves to get to Disneyland, Riverside, Santa Barbara.\u201d\nHe praises the region\u2019s affordability, chemical-free produce and scenic olive groves, alongside a relaxed ethos he describes as the \u201cdomani (tomorrow) attitude.\u201d\nRichardson\u2019s journey to Nard\u00f2 reflects a broader trend of Americans seeking affordable, idyllic retreats abroad. Puglia, with its warm winters and authentic villages, stands apart from tourist-saturated regions like Tuscany or Venice.\n\u201cBeautiful beaches and coastlines, picturesque cities and towns, great weather (even in winter), and not full of the tourists that are found throughout Tuscany, Venice, Milan and Rome. In fact, most tourists tended to be Italians or other Europeans. The Dolce Vita was genuine,\u201d he told the outlet.\nFor now, Richardson splits his time between Nard\u00f2 and California, where he remains close to his aging parents.\n\u201cMy parents are currently still living and I do so much want to spend several months out of the year near them,\u201d he explained. Pending a visa, he plans to extend his stays in Italy, though not yet permanently, savoring the balance between Puglia\u2019s serene coast and his ties to home.\n\u201cI\u2019ve fallen in love with the Italian lifestyle and domani attitude. No need to worry because there is always domani. No worries, it will be taken care of domani, so for now, let\u2019s just have a coffee and watch the people promenade by,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Hollywood insiders have warned thatLos Angelesis at risk of becoming \u201cthe nextDetroit\u201d amid fears that the city\u2019s decades-long status as the capital of TV and film could come to a swift end if entertainment productions do not receive immediate tax relief incentives.\nAmid a sharp rise in the number of celebrities moving out of L.A. to places likeTexasandFlorida, industry workers have now raised the alarm about the stark decline in the number of entertainment projects being carried out inHollywoodand throughoutCalifornia.\nThese fears were the focus of an April 14 town hall in which lawmakers and movie producers pushed for changes to the state\u2019s entertainment production tax incentive in order to cover up to 35% of qualified expenditures, while also widening the range of productions that would receive these subsidies.\n\u201cThis is not hyperbole to say that if we don\u2019t act, the California film and TV industry will become the next Detroit auto,\u201d said producer\u00a0Noelle Stehman, a member of the \u201cStay in LA\u201d campaign who spoke at the event, according toThe Hollywood Reporter.\nDetroit was once seen as America\u2019s auto production hub, with three major car manufacturers headquartered there: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler (now known as Stellantis). However, in the 1960s, those companies began moving their factories to the suburbs, taking a huge number of workers \u2014 and former Detroit residents \u2014 with them.\nNow, Stehman believes that Los Angeles\u2019 entertainment industry could be going the same way, having already lost major ground to its competitors in recent years.\nWhile many entertainment executives live in Los Angeles, state\u00a0Sen. Ben Allen\u00a0said this will do little to help the city retain the lion\u2019s share of productions if housing costs in the city are too high for the middle-class worker.\n\u201cThe studios don\u2019t care where they do the work. They\u2019ll do it anywhere,\u201d he said at the event. \u201cThey\u2019re still producing shows. What a lot of our colleagues simply don\u2019t understand is that this is a middle-class problem. The studio heads are going to bed in Bel-Air no matter what.\u201d\nThe middle-class problem Allen referred to is the high cost of living in Los Angeles. The median income in the city is currently $95,625, but the median home sale price in 2025 is almost 10 times that ($965,300).\nThat number has grown by nearly 50% from 10 years ago, when the median income was $63,000 and the median home sale price was $525,000.\nEntertainment workers have long been calling for California to offer larger \u2014 and more widely available \u2014 tax incentives, with the backing of\u00a0Gov. Gavin Newsom, who vowed in October 2024 to increase film incentives from its current cap of $330 million to $750 million.\nLawmakers hope that they can keep the film and TV industry thriving by providing tax relief. Newsom\u2019s proposed SB630 bill will also boost the credit to 35% while expanding the category of productions that qualify to include animated titles, shorter TV shows, and some unscripted projects.\nCalifornia is the only production hub that does not allow any portion of \u201cabove-the-line\u201d costs, like salaries, from qualifying for incentives\u2014prompting many to seek cheaper options.\nThe bill was created to help boost what\u2019s become a downturn in filming in the state. California offers a 20% base credit, which is lower than other regions. For example, New York offers a tax credit of 30% of qualified production expenses. Georgia has a 20% transferable tax credit, and an additional 10% can be \u201cearned\u201d by including an embedded Georgia logo and link on the projects landing page.Illinoisoffers a 30% credit, with additional incentives including a 15% credit on salaries paid to people who live in economically disadvantaged areas.\nA recent report bynonprofit organization FilmLAindicated that on-location production in Los Angeles was down by 22.4% in Q1 of 2025 versus the same period in 2024.\nThese productions included commercials, feature films, and TV shows\u2014with the report indicating that the drop in numbers had little to do with the recent California wildfires, which largely affected areas that are rarely used as filming locations.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cLoss of filming opportunity in no way compares to the cost of the Eaton and Palisades Fires in terms of loss of life, resident displacement and property damage,\u201d FilmLA VP of Integrated Communications\u00a0Philip Sokoloski\u00a0said in a statement.\n\u201cThe fires sent many productions scrambling to reschedule shoots and displaced hundreds of industry workers from their homes. But their impact on local filming levels appears to have been temporary.\u201d\nCalifornia residents fear the exodus of film productions could be the start of the state losing its celebrity allure, similar to auto\u2019s decline in Detroit.\nNow, Detroit is trying to rebuild following decades of problems. Auto manufacturing took a downturn when Chrysler and GM declared bankruptcy in 2009. It had a ripple effect on the city where thousands of residents were employed by the automakers. In March 2011, Detroit\u2019s population fell to 713,777, according to the U.S Census Bureau. It was a 25% decline from 2000 and the lowest level in 100 years.\nIn 2013, a state review board deemed the city \u201coperational dysfunction\u201d meaning it was not able to restructure its finances, leading to the city filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. A few months later, a federal judge approved a bankruptcy plan\u2014wiping out about $7 billion in debt.\nLosing the clout of the entertainment industry will be a blow to local businesses and will make for a difficult recovery. Hollywood is known for its big feature film productions and TV backlots where iconic series are filmed. At a time when every dollar counts, producers are looking at how to cut budgets, and if it means going on location \u2014 they\u2019re following the money. It\u2019s a win-win for filmmakers and the state that wins the production contract.\n\u201cThis is not a tax giveaway,\u201d said state Assemblyman\u00a0Rick Zbur. \u201cThis is a job program that is keeping people in their homes, keeping people off the unemployment rolls. If we don\u2019t do this, it\u2019s going to cost a lot, lot more than these tax credits are costing us.\u201d\nCalifornia\u2019s competition from other states is cause for concern, and that\u2019s why passing a better tax relief program could be a step in the right direction to keep the entertainment industry in Hollywood.\nNot all celebrities have stayed loyal to living in L.A., with several opting torelocate abroad in the wake of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s election win. They include\u00a0Eva Longoria,\u00a0Ellen DeGeneres,\u00a0Richard Gere, and\u00a0Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\nOthers have chosen to move elsewhere in the US \u2014 often to more tax-friendly states like Texas.\nMatthew McConaughey\u00a0relocated his familyto a property outside of Austin, TX, in 2014, while\u00a0Glen Powell\u00a0also moved back to the Lone Star State.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Kelly Clarkson\u00a0moved production of her hit talk show from L.A. to New York City in 2024\u2014while some stars, like\u00a0John Goodman, opted to leave California years ago, in his case relocating to New Orleans.",

Crain\u2019s Chicago Businessfirst reportedon the sale.\nGriffin paid over $12 million for each of the units in 2017, but the loss is a drop in the bucket for the hedge fund titan with an estimated net worth over $40 billion.\nGriffin departed Chicago for Miami in 2022 after three decades in the city, citing the city\u2019s \u201cwokeness,\u201d crime rates and governance.\n\u201cThe decline in Chicago real estate values is yet another bill coming due from years of failed leadership in Illinois,\u201d Zia Ahmed, a spokesperson for Griffin, said in an emailed statement.\nIn addition to uprooting the Citadel HQ, Griffin left behind listings for multiple high-end properties within blocks of each other.\nThe Tuesday sales mark the end of Griffin\u2019s historic tenure at 9 West Walton. His 2017 purchase of a four-penthouse spread \u2014 plus a pool \u2014 for $59 million marked the largest-ever real estate transaction in Chicago\u2019s history. The other two penthouses, on the 37th and38th floors, sold to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in December for $19 million \u2014 another sales loss of $14.8 million for Griffin, Crain\u2019s reported.\nAll in all, Griffin has lost a total of $23.59 million, or 40%, of his 2017 investment at No. 9 West Walton, Crain\u2019s reported.\nThe Post can confirm that Griffin has one remaining property in Chicago, which has been on and off\u00a0the market since 2022. Griffin\u2019s furnished penthouse at 800 North Michigan Ave., a furnished apartment just blocks away from 9 West Walton, is currently listed for $15.75 million.\nGriffin\u2019s real estate transactions tend to make headlines. The billionaire was outed in February asthe buyerof a $45 million duplex at 740 Park Ave., and he still holds the record for the most expensive home sale in the nation at 220 Central Park South in New York, for which he paid about $238 million in 2019.\nGriffin\u2019s holdings also include a $122 million London mansion near Buckingham Palace and an $84.45 million Hamptons estate previously owned by Calvin Klein.

        "content": "In an era where housing costs are outpacing wage growth, finding a city where rent doesn\u2019t devour a paycheck is increasingly rare.\nOver the past decade, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Consumer Price Index shows rent has surged by more than 50%, tracking closely with skyrocketing home prices.\nYet, stagnant wages have left many struggling to keep up, pushing affordable housing out of reach for a growing number of Americans.\nTo identify cities where renters can still find financial relief,WalletHub, a personal-finance platform, examined median annual gross rent across more than 180 US cities and compared it to median household income.\nThe resulting report ranks cities by their rent-to-income ratio, spotlighting places where housing costs take the smallest bite out of earnings.\n\u201cIn the most affordable cities for renters, the median cost of rent is as low as 15% of the median income, compared to more than 33% in the most expensive cities,\u201d said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst.\n\u201cThis gives people in the least expensive cities a clear financial advantage; the money they save on rent could go toward their emergency fund or savings for future home ownership.\u201d\nTopping the list is Bismarck, North Dakota, where renters spend just 15.34% of their median income on rent.\nWhile the city boasts the 20th-lowest median annual rent among the studied cities, its 73rd-highest median income creates a favorable balance, making housing costs remarkably manageable.\nFor perspective, Miami renters face a stark contrast, dedicating 33.48% of their income to rent \u2014 more than double Bismarck\u2019s share.\nSioux Falls, South Dakota, claims the second spot, with rent consuming 15.95% of median income.\nIts median annual rent ranks as the 21st-cheapest nationwide, paired with the 88th-highest median income, securing its place as a renter-friendly hub.\nCheyenne, Wyoming, rounds out the top three, with renters allocating 16.09% of their earnings to housing.\nThe city\u2019s rent is the 30th-cheapest in the country, and its 76th-highest median income helps maintain a low rent-to-income ratio.\nThe top 10 list includes cities like Cedar Rapids, Iowa (16.36%); Fargo, North Dakota (16.65%); and Charleston, West Virginia (16.70%) \u2014 where renters benefit from low housing costs relative to income.\nWestern and Midwestern cities dominate, with Casper, Wyoming (16.72%); Overland Park, Kansas (16.81%); and Alaska\u2019s Juneau (17.45%) and Anchorage (17.76%) also making the cut.\nThen there are the high-cost outliers.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, cities like Miami (33.48%); Newark, New Jersey (32.96%); and New Haven, Connecticut (32.18%) burden renters with costs that eat up nearly a third of their income.\nDetroit (31.35%); Glendale, California (29.84%); and Bridgeport, Connecticut (29.80%) also rank among the least affordable, highlighting the financial strain in urban centers with high rents and lower median incomes.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "It is hard to find a steal in the Steel City.\nPittsburgh has emerged as the epicenter of a striking rental price escalation across the United States, with rents soaring nearly 50% since 2019 \u2014 outpacing every other major city tracked by real estate analysts.\nThis dramatic rise, which saw the city\u2019s median rent climb 47.9% over the past six years, contrasts with a broader national trend of declining rental costs that has persisted for 20 months, according to new data released byRealtor.com.\nWhile the national median rent dipped to $1,694 in March \u2014 down 3.7% from its 2022 high \u2014 Pittsburgh\u2019s steep increase highlights a regional disparity that continues to challenge affordability there.\nIt all started, as with many smaller cities in America, during 2020.\n\u201cThe rent surge in Pittsburgh can be traced back to the pandemic, when Pittsburgh\u2019s relatively affordable housing began attracting renters in search of lower costs and more space \u2014 particularly from nearby, high-cost metros like New York City,\u201d Realtor.com Economist Jiayi Xu told The Post. \u201cThis shift in demand contributed to rising rental prices.\u201d\nIn sum: There\u2019s a bunch of competition.\nThe nationwide rental market has shown signs of softening, with prices falling $65 from their peak, yet they remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels in nearly all major metros except San Francisco.\nAcross the country, rents are still 20% above their 2019 benchmarks, with Pittsburgh\u2019s surge leading the pack.\nThe rush for Pittsburgh is even reflected in its sales market.\n\u201cIn Pittsburgh especially, homes for sale are hard to find, with the number of active listings down 39.3% in March 2025 compared to March 2019,\u201d Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, said.\nOther cities, such as Tampa, Florida, with a 45.7% rental rise, and Indianapolis, up 34%, also reflect significant growth, but none match Pittsburgh\u2019s trajectory. In California, Sacramento posted a 30.6% increase, yet it pales in comparison to the northeastern city\u2019s gains.\nBerner noted the persistent upward pressure in many markets despite the national decline.\n\u201cWhile the median asking rent is down $65 monthly or over $700 annually, in nearly every major US metro rents are still considerably higher than 2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have seen declines in rents largely due to robust multi-family building and permitting adding more rental options in many metros.\u201d\nHowever, this construction boom has not yet reached Pittsburgh in a way that tempers its rising costs, leaving renters to grapple with the aftermath of a market that has outstripped supply.\n\u201cOn the supply side, new construction has not kept up with demand,\u201d Xu added.\n\u201cIn Pittsburgh, only 1,738 units in buildings with five or more units were permitted for construction in 2024 \u2014 just 2.3% above the average number permitted units between 2019 and 2023. In other words, as rental demand has surged, limited new supply has intensified competition and driven prices higher.\u201d\nThe rental landscape remains uneven, with some regions experiencing continued price growth.\nNew York saw a 5.6% jump in March, while Kansas City, where rents hit a record $1,371, rose 4.3%.\nThe Washington, DC area followed with a 2.6% increase.\nAnalysts suggest that the South and West have benefited from a surge in multifamily housing starts over recent years, adding inventory during one of the slowest housing markets in decades.\nYet, the construction momentum is shifting, with Midwestern cities like Milwaukee \u2014 where housing starts more than doubled between March 2024 and 2025 \u2014 Oklahoma City, Memphis, and Ohio\u2019s Cleveland and Columbus now leading the charge.\nAdvertisement",

But perhaps the single biggest impact a change in Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status could have would be on the university\u2019s vast real estate holdings in Boston and Cambridge.AdvertisementWhile Harvard does pay some local real estate taxes on primarily commercial property, such as storefronts it owns in Harvard Square and the under-construction Enterprise Research Campus in north Allston, the vast majority of its property \u2014 dorms, classroom and administration buildings, its athletic complex \u2014 is tax-exempt.So how much property does Harvard control?On either side of the Charles River, Harvard owns or leases close to 873 acres of land, nearly all of it exempt from local property taxes. Among its Cambridge, north Allston, and Longwood Medical Area campuses, the university controls about 500 buildings. Those include its undergraduate campus in Cambridge\u2019s Harvard Square, business school campus in Boston\u2019s Allston neighborhood, and medical and dental school campuses in Longwood. Outside of the medical and dental campuses, Harvard\u2019s holdings in Allston and Cambridge span more than 21 million square feet.AdvertisementHarvard's Science and Engineering Complex in Allston.HarvardWhat about the Arboretum?Then there\u2019s the Arnold Arboretum, a 281-acre nature preserve and living museum in Jamaica Plain. Harvard originally owned the property when it was established in 1872, then Charles Sprague Sargent, a botanist and the Arboretum\u2019s first director, and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted in 1882 gave the Arboretum property to the city of Boston in exchange for a 1,000-year lease at a rate of $1 per year.

The first phase of construction is still underway, but some of the campus has already been added to Boston\u2019s tax rolls, and when fully built out it will eventually be a big property-tax payer in Boston. The 14-acre first phase includes 510,000 square feet of lab space developed by Breakthrough Properties, the biotech arm of real estate giant Tishman Speyer, along with 343 apartments and a conference center named for private equity billionaire and philanthropist David Rubenstein. Construction on the 900,000-square-foot first phase started in November 2023 and is slated to wrap up next year.AdvertisementA rendering of the planned David Rubenstein Treehouse Conference Center at Harvard University in Allston.

In 2023, the most recent year the city of Boston has publicly reported on its PILOT program, Boston said Harvard\u2019s holdings on its side of the Charles River \u2014 including the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex in Allston and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the Longwood Medical Area \u2014 were worth a combined $1.5 billion, and sought about $14 million in PILOT payments. Harvard contributed more than $11 million in fiscal 2023 \u2014 $4 million in cash and the other $7 million in credits for various community benefits \u2014 in Boston and $4.7 million in Cambridge.What happens if Harvard loses tax-exempt status?As of now, there\u2019s no clear answer \u2014 but it\u2019s something every major research institution in the United States is closely watching.\u201cThis whole idea that the IRS could suspend Harvard\u2019s nonprofit status is laughable on the face of it,\u201d said George W. \u201cMac\u201d McCarthy, president and CEO of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge. \u201cThere a lot of stumbling blocks that somebody could put into their way. The people who manage Harvard\u2019s endowment, and manage that university, are very sophisticated, and they know how to navigate IRS rules, and do whatever they can to maintain a pristine 501(c)(3) status.\u201dAnd unlike federal income tax deductions, property taxes are administered by local governments, under state law. It\u2019s not yet clear if or how a federal ruling might impact what goes on in Massachusetts, or how Boston and Cambridge might choose to tax Harvard should the opportunity arise.AdvertisementBut long before any of that hits, McCarthy said, any threat to Harvard\u2019s nonprofit status would likely prompt fierce legal action.\u201cThere\u2019s way too much at stake there to let it go,\u201d he said.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

What can you do the rest of the year, especially during a New England winter?\n\nBut moving to this Colonial on the shores ofForest Lakein Methuen assures 12 months of beauty, even during what seems like an endless winter. Once the ice melts on the 49-acre lake, activities include fishing, kayaking, electric-powered boating, and swimming.\n\n\nA wide driveway directly off the street leads to the lawn in front of the home. An angled wooden walkway connects the lawn to the front door of the home with pale yellow siding and light green shutters flanking double-hung windows on three levels.\n\nStepping inside, there is a foyer and a hallway that run deep into the center of the home. The open floor plan incorporates the three standards \u2014 kitchen, dining, and living areas \u2014 and also shares the same manufactured ash hardwood flooring. There is also a half bath on this level with ceramic tile flooring.\n\n\nThe 218-square-foot kitchen is U-shaped with wood-toned cabinets. Seating is available on the left side of the gray Formica counters. The sink is underneath a window, and an upper-level cabinet to the left has a wine rack and clear glass doors to store goblets. There is recessed lighting, and the appliances \u2014 including the gas stove \u2014 are stainless steel.\n\nThe 187-square-foot dining area follows the kitchen and currently hosts a table with seating for six located underneath a double-hung window on the right exterior wall. But more natural light arrives from the clear glass sliders that connect to the rear deck overlooking the lake and the private dock.\n\n\nA line of thick crown molding runs along the dining area wall and continues into the 233-square-foot living area, which is reached by a left turn. A key feature of this portion of the first level is the stone-faced gas fireplace that runs from floor to ceiling in the left corner of the room. There is a second, clear glass slider that also connects to the rear deck.\n\nOn the second level, there are four bedrooms \u2014 including the primary suite \u2014 and a full bath.\n\n\nThe primary suite is a sun-splashed refuge, especially the 336-square-foot bedroom where there are so many windows pulling in natural light. The main window is a modifiedPalladian design; in this iteration, the arched window is atop the two smaller windows. To the left is a door that opens to the private balcony with sweeping views of the lake.\n\nThe main light fixture is a chandelier with flame-like bulbs in the center of the ceiling. The bedroom has a gas-burning fireplace inset into a split-face stone mantle. A double-hung window is to the left of the gas fireplace. The flooring is engineered hardwood.\n\nThere is a walk-in closet with built-in shelving and cabinetry.\n\n\nThe 96-square-foot ensuite bath has a mahogany-toned vanity on the right with an oval bowl sink underneath a plate glass mirror. Opposite is a long jacuzzi soaking tub with silver faucets positioned underneath a double-hung window. The room flows to the shower insert on the right behind clear glass doors.\n\nTwo of the three secondary bedrooms are carpeted, have ceiling fans, and have closets behind sliding doors. The third bedroom, currently used as a library/office, has wood flooring and a ceiling fan.\n\n\nThe 513-square-foot basement level is finished and comfortably furnished. Currently, there is a large sectional lining parts of two walls and a white refrigerator inset into the opposite wall, while a four-person table is positioned between them. There are above-ground windows on three exterior walls and a door with plates of clear glass windows opening to the rear yard and access to the lake.\n\nOn this level, there is a full bath with a white porcelain pedestal sink and a shower/tub combination. The flooring is hardwood.\n\nThe home has an unfinished walk-up attic, gas heat, central air conditioning, and a whole-house generator.\n\nChristian Doherty ofDoherty Properties in Chelmsfordhas the listing.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nWe are currently working on a renovation project at a house that has basement flooding issues. Given the spring rains and the already melted snow from the winter, the water tables in many areas are high right now. This reminded me of quite a few questions that I\u2019ve received from readers, as well as some spirited feedback. Some key points to think about to keep our homes dry as we make our way through an often-wet spring:\n\n\nThe right gutter guard, properly installed, can have its benefits. One of our pet peeves is that they aren\u2019t foolproof, and many homeowners are unaware that you need to do regular maintenance of the system, especially downspouts and leader pipes. The home we are working on had downspout elbows packed with debris, causing water to back up and pond at the corner of the house. We think this is one of the sources of the water in the basement. So please maintain the water management system regardless of whether you use gutter guards and pull that water away from the foundation.\n\n\nMany homes with high water tables are basically like a bowl submerged in water. You may see water come in from this corner or that corner, but the water table is most likely surrounding your whole basement. French drains around the perimeter leading into a sump pump are the gold standard for dealing with a high water table. They are basically an underwater gutter system for your home. For any number of reasons such as utility locations, structural issues, or cost, they can be prohibitive. We have had projects where two carefully placed sump pumps that discharge to the outside have kept a basement from flooding. Depending on a home\u2019s location and topography, this could be a far less invasive procedure. We advise all our clients to include a battery backup for your sump pump or French drain system. These are very simple to add when the pumps are installed. So often you will need the sump pump to work in a heavy storm, which is also the most likely time to lose power. The battery backup switches over immediately when you lose power. Highly recommended.\n\n\nFinally, proper grading outside the perimeter of the house is also important. Often, we have seen homes where landscaping has taken precedence and deep mulch beds have formed berms that prevent water from flowing away from the foundation. Worse, it traps the water! The earth should be highest against the foundation and flow away from it. Along the same lines, the downspouts work best when they have a leader pipe on the end pulling water at least 24 inches from the house.\n\nQ.My 65-year-old raised ranch has a set of concrete front steps and a landing. Last year, I noticed holes at two places at the inside corners, where the rise meets the lower landing step. Are these a structural concern? Even if not, I would like to repair them, if only for cosmetic reasons. Suggestions?\n\nMatthew\n\nA.I am going to assume your question means a prefabricated set of concrete stairs. These were very common in raised ranches back then. They are also very sturdy because they were cast as a single monolithic concrete pour. The ones we have had to take apart have rebar or steel wire laced through them for strength. They are hollow underneath. All to say if you address those holes in a timely manner and keep water from getting in and under the stairs assembly, you should not have to worry about them structurally falling apart.\n\nIf the holes do not go all the way through, you can use any concrete/mortar patch to fill in the hole and then work it smooth to blend into the concrete face.\n\nHowever, it sounds like the hole may go all the way through since those precast stairs are only 2+ inches thick. If that is the case, you will need to pack the hole with something, which can be tricky. This may sound crazy, but working in some window and door foam into the hole and letting it dry can give you a good base. Carve away the excess foam so you have \u00be to 1 inch of cavity to fill, then apply a bonding agent, then place your concrete or mortar repair over that. This is more time-consuming, with multiple applications, but it will hold up better than just trying to jam mortar into the hole and having it fall through the other side.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

        "content": "ByThe Boston Globe\nFor all its varied landscapes, towns, and people, New England is a compact region. From many points in Massachusetts north of Boston, for example, you can drive to Boston, New Hampshire, and Maine \u2014 all within an hour or less.\nWhen it comes time to start house hunting, some buyers can ostensibly browse in one or all of the three states. They might assume the cost of living is roughly the same in each, but the numbers show something different \u2014 even when a home\u2019s sale price stays the same. It begs the question: If you\u2019re leaving the city for life in the \u2018burbs, is it worth it to cross state lines?\nAhead, see how we took $600,000 and compared what you\u2019ll get settling down in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine to answer that question.\nA Cape in Chelmsford\nPrice:$600,000\nBedrooms:2\nBathrooms:1.5\nSquare feet:1,409\nLot size:0.17 acres\nEstimated annual property taxes:$6,668\nPRO:An easier commute\nCON:Less square footage\nA budget of $600,000 can net you a charming Cape-style abode in Chelmsford, Mass. This recently sold home measures roughly 1,400 square feet and offers two bedrooms, one full bathroom, and one half bath. Among its selling points are a newly renovated kitchen, a finished basement, a new roof, new windows, a one-car garage, and a fenced-in backyard.\nLife in Chelmsford is pretty pleasant, according to listing agentEmily Medwarwith Barrett Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Licensed in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire, she highlighted the value of free school busing for children who live more than 2 miles from their school.\n\u201cI think Chelmsford is a highly desirable location because the town provides excellent value for housing but also boasts a top-rated school system,\u201d she said.\nOther perks? The town offers free trash and recycling pickup, robust programming for seniors, and commuter rail access in nearby Billerica that can get you to Boston in roughly 35 minutes.\nWhile some of her buyers opt for New Hampshire because there is no income tax (though New Hampshire residents working in Massachusetts must pay Massachusetts income tax),others are turned off by the increased property taxes in the Granite State. Still, they tend to even out, since home prices in New Hampshire are typically lower than in Massachusetts, Medwar said, explaining that it\u2019s the daily commute that plays a bigger role in the decision.\n\u201cMany buyers weigh the trade-off between affordability and commute time, often choosing to live in New Hampshire for the lower home prices while accepting a longer drive to work in Massachusetts,\u201d she said.\nRoom to roam in Weare\nPrice:$600,000\nBedrooms:3\nBathrooms:2.5\nSquare feet:2,117\nLot size:5.69 acres\nEstimated annual property tax:$7,620\nPRO:More space for your money (plus acreage to grow food)\nCON:Higher property taxes\nIf you\u2019re the buyer who doesn\u2019t mind a long commute, you\u2019ll get more for your money in Weare, N.H., which is about an hour and 15 minutes from Boston via I-93 (on a good day). This newly sold home flaunts lots of room both inside and out, offering over 2,000 square feet of living space and almost 6 acres of land with flourishing gardens and a potting shed.\n\u201cThe seller had every single vegetable, every single herb, every single spice [in her garden],\u201d said listing agentNiki Loikowith Keller Williams Metropolitan, who\u2019s licensed in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. \u201cAnd she had chickens.\u201d That could be considered a cost-saving measure as egg prices continue to tick up.\nInside the home, there are a slew of new upgrades, including a primary bedroom with an en-suite bath, twin dressing tables, and a deck.\nThe town of Weare has benefits, too, with free trash and recycling pickup, free school busing for grades K through 8, free extra-curricular activities after school, and fantastic farmers markets, according to Loiko.\n\u201cWe do not have income [or sales] tax, which is wonderful when you\u2019re shopping and working here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when it comes to our property taxes, I have to make sure when I\u2019m helping my clients search for houses, I tell them, \u2018Before you even get excited and look at the photos, we should look at the taxes first.\u2019\u201d\nNew construction in Wells\nPrice:$600,000\nBedrooms:3\nBathrooms:2\nSquare feet:1,447\nLot size:0.8 acres\nEstimated annual property tax:$3,181\nPRO:Free school busing and after-school programs\nCON:No town-sponsored trash pickup\nBuilt in 2023, this recent sale came move-in ready \u2014 and assuaged any fears about outdated heating, cooling, or electrical systems. Open-concept living, a laundry nook, a primary suite, and a two-car garage are among its standout features.\nWhile this house offers a bit more square footage and acreage than the home in Chelmsford, it does not come close when compared to the one in Weare. It\u2019s about the same distance to Boston as Weare \u2014 via I-95 \u2014 but proximity to the ocean and hiking trails is unique to this property.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone who likes to be outside, especially at beaches, Maine has a lot more oceanfront than New Hampshire,\u201d saidTroy Williams, the listing agent with Williams Realty Partners. He\u2019s licensed in both Maine and New Hampshire, and added that even registering your boat is more expensive in New Hampshire than in Maine due to the state\u2019s tax structure.\nIn Wells, trash pickup is not included \u2014 instead, you\u2019re tasked with bringing trash to the town transfer station, where a vehicle sticker costs $5 annually, plus added fees for select items. School busing is free, however, as are after-school athletics and programs for kids. As a homeowner or renter in Wells, you can buy a seasonal beach parking sticker for $40. In addition, depending on where your home is located, you\u2019re eligible to get your electricity fromKennebunk Light & Power, a local and cheaper alternative to Central Maine Power, the dominant utility provider in the state. As a commuter, you may end up paying between 50 cents and $7 in tolls on I-95, depending on your trip length and whether you have anE-ZPass transponder.\nThe pros and cons for each option are many. Deciding where to move may involve a cost-benefit analysis, or it could just come down to personal preference.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\nBe civil.

That means there is a lot of wear-and-tear and inevitable repairs to consider tackling.\nWhen is it time to stay, and when is it time to go when dealing with drafty windows, a cracked foundation, or other signs of \u2014 shall we say, maturity?\n\u201cThe current market is tough for first-time buyers,\u201d saidEric Sugrue, a Redfin Boston agent. \u201cThe inventory of available houses to buy has never been lower in our market. Most buyers realize they will have to compromise.\u201d\nBuy a home warranty or negotiate one from the seller to provide peace of mind that at least all of the mechanicals are covered, Sugrue said, before emphasizing that buyers remember the acronym PEACH: Plumbing, Electrical, Air Conditioning, and Heating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the aesthetic design aspects when touring a home, but it\u2019s important that buyers \u2014 and especially first-time buyers \u2014 focus more on the things that either they can\u2019t change or can cost them a lot of money down the road,\u201d addedAmanda Pendleton, a Zillow home trends expert.\nLocation and layout are hard to change, so if you aren\u2019t satisfied with those, it might be best to find another home. But nice-to-have things like a chef\u2019s kitchen are easier to add down the line. Buyers should look for signs of pests and structural damage: Visible water damage, uneven floorboards, and gaps in windows or doors can be a sign of problems becoming bigger issues if they aren\u2019t fixed, Pendleton said.\nWhile all of those interviewed for this story emphasized the importance of working with experienced real estate agents and conducting a full home inspection for true peace of mind, they also noted there\u2019s no one-issue-applies-to-all when it comes to home buying.\n\u201cThat is a very challenging question to answer, because it\u2019s so much about personal preference,\u201d said Sarah Gustafson, president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cEach house is unique, and it\u2019s unique to the buyer who is buying.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "A developer looking to put up more than 200 apartments in a wooded Hyde Park property that\u2019s treasured by neighbors has won a key court victory in a legal battle with City Hall over the project.An affiliate of Dallas-based apartment developer Willow Bridge and the property\u2019s owner, the Jubilee Christian Church, had sued the Boston Planning & Development Agency, essentially accusing the city agency of leaving their 204-unit project in bureaucratic limbo by requesting changes that were not necessary to comply with the site\u2019s existing zoning. They initially filed plans for a section of the 24-acre property \u2014 known locally as \u201cCrane Ledge Woods\u201d \u2014 with the city in 2021, and have since scaled back their ambitions from originally aiming to build 270 units on the site.On April 10, Land Court judge Kevin Smith ruled that the BPDA cannot order such an aggressive redesign of a project if it complies with the city\u2019s zoning code. Instead, the judge said the city agency and planning staff only have the authority to apply \u201creasonable and appropriate conditions\u201d as part of approving such \u201cas-of-right\u201d projects.\u201cWe\u2019re excited and happy at the outcome,\u201d said Andrew Ward, executive director of business at Jubilee. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey.\u201dAdvertisementThe project now heads back to the city\u2019s planning staff for further review. Smith remanded the case to the BPDA, giving the agency 30 days after the developer submits full design documents for its revised project to determine what additional information is needed before the agency can complete its review and issue what\u2019s known as an \u201cadequacy determination,\u201d a necessary step for obtaining a building permit. Those documents, per the Mintz law firm, were filed on Thursday.Advertisement\u201cThe project has undergone rigorous BPDA review already,\u201d said Kelly Frey, a Mintz partner who represents Willow Bridge. \u201cWe hope this decision is enough to prompt them to get this done as expeditiously as possible.\u201dJubilee says it originally considered using the property at 990 American Legion Highway to build a new church, but later decided to develop it instead; ideas involving Home Depot or Walmart were floated over the years. (Jubilee currently has its main church in Mattapan, as well as locations in Stoughton and Worcester.) Then-mayor Marty Walsh made it clear he wanted to see more housing, so Jubilee teamed up with Lincoln Property Co., and then later with Lincoln\u2019s Willow Bridge offshoot, to pursue those plans.Those plans prompted fierce opposition from neighbors who launched a coalition to \u201cSave Crane Ledge Woods\u201d and flooded City Hall with complaints about the project. Opponents argued that this site remained as the largest unprotected \u201curban wild\u201d left in the city of Boston, providing an important habitat for wildlife and a buffer against rising temperatures and rainstorms.The BPDA did not provide a comment on Friday when asked about the agency\u2019s reaction to the court decision.Frank O\u2019Brien, a member of the Crane Ledge Woods Coalition, said the ruling creates an opening for Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration to talk to the church and the developer about preserving the property.\u201cThe site as an urban woodland should be acquired for public benefit purposes,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe court ruling creates a window to accomplish that.\u201dJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

        "content": "A chill has fallen over the US housing market.\nThe typical American home is selling at its slowest pace in six years, according to a newRedfin report.\nCompetition between buyers declined as the supply of homes hit a five-year high. The fresh data, first reported byMansion Global, reveals that the post-2020 heyday of multiple offers, bidding wars and hair-trigger buyers is well and truly over.\nExperts blame sluggish sales and lackluster competition on climbing supply, skittish buyers and overpriced listings. Some owners can\u2019t hold out any longer for lower mortgage rates, the Redfin report suggested, and house hunters are feeling too much uncertainty to pull the trigger.\n\u201cBecause they bought at the peak of the market, they\u2019re overpricing their homes to try to recoup their investment,\u201d Houston-based Redfin Premier real estate agent Alicia Grifaldo said in the report. \u201cSellers are competing with one another, and buyers are sparse, so pricing your listing reasonably is everything right now.\u201d\nThe typical US home went under contract in March after 47 days on the market, according to Redfin.\nBy comparison, homes in 2022 took less than half that time. Thanks to a 14.1% year-over-year uptick in active listings, competition is cooler and bidding wars are less common. Only 27% of buyers paid above the listing price in March \u2014 the lowest March share since 2020.\nPending sales, closed sales and existing-home sales were all below pre-pandemic levels, but there was variation between markets. Homes in 17 of the 50 most populous metros surveyed by Redfin still sold within two weeks.\nTariff fears and heightened mortgage rates are making buyers nervous, the report said, and influxes of new housing in states like Texas and Florida are creating an imbalance between supply and demand.\nBuyers are no longer competing with each other. It\u2019s sellers that need to stand out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing disconnect between what sellers think they can get for their homes and the direction the market is actually moving,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Elijah de la Campa. \u201cTariff fears and widespread economic uncertainty are making homebuyers nervous, so if sellers don\u2019t lower their price expectations, home sales may slow in the coming months.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A sprawling estate in East Hampton, steeped in history and cherished by one family for more than half a century, has listed for $27 million \u2014 marking only its second time on the market since its construction in 1958, The Post has learned.\nThe 1.69-acre property at 21 Hook Pond Lane, formerly owned by a World War II veteran \u2014 the late Seldon Taylor James Jr. \u2014 and his wife, Linda James, offers sweeping vistas across Hook Pond, the tonyMaidstone Cluband the Atlantic Ocean, a rare combination that commands its lofty price tag.\nThe 4,000-square-foot home, designed by renowned local architect Alfred Scheffer, features six bedrooms, five bathrooms and a first-floor primary suite with an adjacent library.\nAt its core lies an eye-catching double-height great room, distinguished by 200-year-old timber beams, wide-plank floors and expansive bookshelves framing views of the serene pond.\n\u201cAlfred Scheffer liked to select these historic references and incorporate them into his designs,\u201d said Liz Carey, who co-listing the property with Valerie H. Smith of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. \u201cIt\u2019s got triple hung windows and a massive fireplace, and it is really the heart of the house.\u201d\nThe property\u2019s allure is deeply tied to its setting.\nTucked at the end of a private lane in the heart of East Hampton village, it sits just minutes from Main Beach and the area\u2019s upscale shops and restaurants. Its dock and proximity to the water foster an intimate connection to the environment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really cool about this house is it\u2019s set close to the water and there\u2019s an incredible abundance of wildlife here,\u201d Carey said. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend five minutes in the house without turning into an environmentalist because the bunny comes hopping out of the bush and the turkeys go strutting across and the bald eagle lands in the tree.\u201d\nThe estate\u2019s price hinges on its unparalleled scenery.\n\u201cThe view, the view, the view,\u201d said Smith, explaining the valuation. \u201cIt\u2019s a heart-stopping forever and ever view that will never be developed in any way because it sees a golf course that will always remain a golf course and the pond where nothing can happen.\u201d\nShe added that the vista, often dotted with swans, is \u201cone of the longest open views in East Hampton and forever protected.\u201d\nThe home\u2019s history is as rich as its surroundings.\nOriginally built by Bishop Austin Pardue, who led the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh for nearly three decades, and his wife, Dorothy, the residence was crafted with Scheffer\u2019s signature attention to historical detail and site-specific design.\nThe bishop\u2019s family resided in the house until 1970, when it was purchased by Seldon, a Navy veteran, wool trader, former Allen and Company employee \u2014 and later an independent investment banker in New York and Director of CPAC Inc. in upstate Rochester.\nWhen he bought the Hook Pond property, he encountered an unexpected connection.\n\u201cOne of our favorite stories was when this current family bought the house 55 years ago, the father of the family went next door to introduce himself to the neighbors,\u201d Carey said. \u201cAnd the neighbor opened the front door and they exclaimed each other\u2019s names. They realized they had grown up together as expats in Argentina, as children, and now here they were 40 or 50 years later, living next door to each other. The odds were incredible.\u201d\nSeldon passed away in 2012 at the age of 81 and the home has remained in the family.\n\u201cThey just have a supernatural devotion to the house and property and have just been, I think the short answer is so happy here,\u201d Smith said. But with their three children now settled in California, Canada and the Hudson Valley, maintaining the home has become impractical.\n\u201cThere was absolutely no reason to move on,\u201d Smith noted. \u201cBut as life changes and their three children are all living very much elsewhere, it\u2019s just not realistic for them to spend the kind of time here that they would love to.\u201d\nThe decision to sell is tinged with emotion.\n\u201cThey\u2019re leaving the Hamptons altogether,\u201d Carey said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s bittersweet because it\u2019s a really special, unique spot that they\u2019ve poured their hearts into for so long.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Condo sales fell in the first quarter of this year in Miami Beach and across the barrier islands, according to a new report by Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman.\nThe new report, covered bythe Real Deal, aligns with a growing picture of South Florida as a housing market catching its breath, as insurance rates and property taxes strain owners and scare away buyers spoiled for choice.\nA major homebuilder in Florida warned investors in late March that company KB Home would have to slash prices by more than $30,000 in Florida to improve business in the poor-performing market,Realtor.com reported.\nIn Miami-Dade County, the number of newly signed contracts for single-family homes and condos declined in March for the third consecutive time, despite an increase in new listings.\nSales remained on a solid trajectory in Palm Beach, however.

The state\u2019s condo inventory wasat an all-time high early in the year, as new supply outpaced demand, natural disasters racked up insurance rates and new statewide safety regulations caused HOA fees to soar.\nCondo sales across the barrier islands \u2014 which includes locales like Sunny Isles Beach, Key Biscayne and Surfside \u2014 dropped alongside single-family home sales.\nThe luxury market wasn\u2019t spared, either.

The median sales price on the luxury end also soared annually \u2014 reaching $23.75 million, a 70.9% increase from a median $13.9 million.\nSuch activity in Palm Beach has been brewing for several months, and especially in the wake of the November election. Referred to by local brokers as the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d luxury home sales near Mar-a-Lagohave grownin number. Eventhe sum of listingsunder contract between November and December 2024 alone skyrocketed by more than 400% year-over-year, with sales volume at that time reaching nearly $291 million \u2014 a jaw-dropping 612% annual increase.\nPalm Beach is an island of its own, Mansion Global notes.\nAcross the Intracoastal, West Palm Beach saw the sum of closed sales fall, though the median sales price edged up a modest 2.1% to $590,000. All the while, inventory grew, with 32.2% more homes up for grabs in the first quarter of 2025 over that of 2024, making for 11.5 months of supply.\nOther South Florida hot spots \u2014 such as Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale \u2014 also saw sales slow and listings pile up, though prices remained resilient, Mansion Global noted. Not too far away from those, Miami Beach had its median price grow 4.3%, though sales slowed by 17.1% and inventory swelled by 34.1% to nine months of supply.\nExperts have previously told The Post the broader South Florida marketcatching its breathafter its pandemic-era years of high activity. Now, rising insurance rates, property taxes and condominium assessments have scared potential buyers away. Recent weeks have also brought other aspects of concern among them.\n\u201cThey are more conscious of the state of the world, the economic situation, insurance, real estate taxes and then mortgage rates, for sure,\u201d Simon Isaacs, CEO and founder of Simon Isaacs Real Estate, previously told The Post.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "In Houston, an enclave of 11 homes fully powered by Tesla technology is drawing fervent interest from buyers \u2014 all as Elon Musk navigates turbulent waters withongoing vehicle vandalism.\nDemand is unrelenting, with inquiries flooding in from as far afield as Washington State and overseas.\n\u201cWe have honestly had no issues with Trump and Musk backlash. In fact, I had over 150-plus people at my brokers\u2019 open. It was insane, people were very excited,\u201d Jamie Fallon, a Houston-based real estate broker handling the homes\u2019 sales, toldRealtor.com. (Musk himself is not involved.)\nNestled in the Oaks of Shady Acres neighborhood, these properties \u2014 constructed by Utopia Homes, in partnership with Tesla \u2014 boast the company\u2019s solar roof tiles, Powerwall batteries and electric vehicle chargers, offering a lifeline of continuous electricity in a state plagued by power outages due to its independent grid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only community of its kind in North America,\u201d Fallon told The Post. \u201cThey created this product because of the loss of power that we continuously have here.\u201d\n\u201cAll of our electrical is above the air. It\u2019s not buried underground. And so when there\u2019s a power storm, it\u2019ll knock out a transformer, it knocks out power lines monthly. And so we continuously have power outages.\u201d\nThe homes, priced at $524,000 for smaller models and $544,900 for larger ones, far exceed Houston\u2019s median listing price of $365,000.\n\u201cHouston is an oil and gas place, so having the first Tesla-powered homes is unheard of,\u201d she said.\nOnly four homes remain unsold, Fallon told The Post.\nThe homes\u2019 energy independence, powered by corrosion-resistant steel solar tiles and backed by Powerwall storage, eliminates electric bills and ensures 24/7 outage protection, according to listing details.\nThe properties blend cutting-edge sustainability with high-end design.\nFallon said they wanted to partner with Tesla because they offered \u201caesthetically pleasing shingles.\u201d\n\u201cTesla is one of the only ones that has actual shingles. So these aren\u2019t the ugly solar panels, the big rectangle square ones, these are true shingles,\u201d Fallon told The Post. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want something that looked aesthetically gross.\u201d\nAn available three-bedroom, 1,907-square-foot home features floor-to-ceiling windows, a sleek kitchen with Whirlpool appliances and Quartz countertops \u2014 and a spa-inspired primary suite with a soaking tub and an expansive shower.\nThe listing touts a \u201cprivate yard, perfect for relaxation or entertaining,\u201d and proximity to local trails and shopping.\nBuyers, described by Fallon as \u201cnormal, everyday people,\u201d include international prospects eager to secure these innovative dwellings.\n\u201cThe cooler thing is in those neighborhoods close by, there\u2019s houses that don\u2019t have any of this technology that are around the same price. So why would you purchase one of those [homes] when you can get one of these?\u201d Fallon asked.\n\u201cWhile we are big on oil, gas and generators, now people are seeing that they can have Tesla-powered homes at similar price points. We are not selling sunset; we are selling power,\u201d she told Realtor.com.\nThe fervor suggests a potential shift in Texas, where Fallon believes such homes could become a blueprint for future development.\n\u201cWhat legislation we have in Washington is going to dictate it, but going toward clean energy is where I think the country is headed. I think there is a mindset shift happening,\u201d she added.\nFallon herself is sold on the technology, planning to install Tesla\u2019s solar shingles \u2014 priced between between $50 and $88 per square foot \u2014 on her own home.\n\u201cThe next time I have to replace my roof, I\u2019m putting Tesla shingles. You can\u2019t even tell [what they are], they look so good,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "\nA content creator whose grandmother lives insideThe Villageshas lifted the lid on what life is really like inside the infamousFloridaretirement community, after staying with her relative \u2014 and experiencing a taste of the lifestyle.\nKara\u00a0Buchanan, a popular travel influencer who, along with her husband,\u00a0Nate, runs a\u00a0wildly successfulYouTube channelon which they document their globe-trotting adventures.\nHowever, for her most recent travels, Kara chose to stay a little closer to home, venturing not to some far-flung destination but to the Sunshine State, where she got the chance to see what it\u2019s really like to live in\u00a0The Villages \u2014 and whether themany sordid rumors about the goings-on thereare true.\nThe Villages has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a trailer park in the 1970s. Today, it is a thriving, age-55-and-older community that spans 57 square miles \u2014 although it looks set to increase that footprint in the coming years.\nLast year,US Census datarevealed that The Villages was the nation\u2019s fastest-growing metro, growing 4.7% between 2022 and 2023.\nThe purpose-built community offers its residents a wide array of amenities, including 3,000 social and special-interest clubs as well as activities like square dancing, drama, water ballet, belly dancing, precision golf cart driving, cheerleading, and tambourine tapping.\nThere are also 14 country clubs, 17 pools, and 100,000 golf carts.\nAdding to their appeal is the fact that access to all of the community amenities \u2014 gyms, pools, rec centers, softball fields, golf courses, clubs, and activities \u2014 are available for a fee of $199 per month, no matter the size of a resident\u2019s home.\nHowever, while the community is advertised as a thriving \u201cbackdrop where you can live life to the fullest,\u201d it is The Villages\u2019 residents and its bustling social scene that have attracted the most attention over the years.\nMany reports and rumors have emerged about the reportedly risqu\u00e9 scene that has emerged inside The Villages \u2014 with the community making national headlines in 2006, whenWFTV newsreported that its Women\u2019s Center had seen a enormous uptick in the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\u201cOne physician at the Women\u2019s Center of The Villages said even in her years working in Miami, she has never seen so many cases,\u201d the report stated.\nThis quote went viral, and the community quickly became known as the \u201cSTD Capital of America,\u201d despite subsequent reporting calling attention to the fact that there was no accurate data to back up these rumors.\nStill, the stain of scandal has persisted inside The Villages ever since \u2014 with more fuel added to that fire when reports began to surface, suggesting that a group of swingers living in the community wereusing \u201cloofah signaling\u201din order to publicly express their sexual preferences to other residents.\nThat rumor has beentraced backto a riff made by comedian\u00a0Tora Himan, an Orlando-area drag queen who previously performed at The Villages as part of a cabaret show.\nA similar whisper that ran rampant involved upside-down pineapples. That scandal saw people on the web claiming that upside-down pineapples in The Villages were a way to signalize swinging.\nHowever, according to Kara\u2019s grandma, these rumors have no truth to them.\n\u201cAre the rumors true? Do you know anyone that has loofahs on their door or upside-down pineapples?\u201d Kara questioned.\n\u201cHaha, no. I have heard some rumors but as far as I know, they are not true,\u201d she insisted.\nAlthough the swinging rumors may hold little credence, one thing is for sure \u2014 the residents of The Villages sure know how to party.\nIn her viral video, Kara revealed that the residents often gathered around the courtyard and spent \u201call night\u201d dancing, although her grandmother revealed that this really meant they were out and about until \u201c9 p.m.\u201d\nAnd while she insisted that her grandmother had seen no evidence of loofahs or pineapples being used on the dating scene, Kara did walk away with information about one rather unique method that some residents use to indicate they are single: \u201cleaving the tag out on your shirt when you\u2019re dancing.\u201d\nStill, after enjoying multiple nights out at The Villages, Kara found it lively enough to brand the retirement community \u201ccollege for retired people.\u201d\nThe community\u2019s broad range of home prices is another reason The Villages is so popular among the silver set.\nAs of this writing, there are over 900 homes for sale in The Villages onRealtor.com\u00ae. The community has roughly 71,000 homes total, with new ones springing up daily. The median list price is currently $389,900.\nThe most expensive home on the market in The Villages right now clocks in at\u00a0$1.5 million. It\u2019s a four-bedroom, three-bath, 3,508-square-foot house on a nearly half-acre lot.\nThe pricier homes in The Villages tend to be on a golf course, preserve, or lake, according to real estate agent April Couturier. The home mentioned above checks two of those boxes and also happens to be in one of the upscale neighborhoods around Lake Sumter.\nAdvertisement",

Needless to say, it\u2019s pretty far from a song.\nThe five-time Grammy-winning artist had been renting this Connecticut property for $75,000 a month for almost two years, starting in July 2023.\nNow it\u2019s on the market for sale and can be yours for $13.9 million, Gimme Shelter has learned \u2014 down from its initial $16.9 million ask in 2022.\nKnown as Orchard\u2019s End, the New Canaan estate sits on 6.25 acres. The grand brick-and-limestone main residence, a Tudor mansion at 544 Oenoke Ridge, was built in 1929.\nThe property was also once owned by the late Carlos Hank Gonz\u00e1lez, nicknamed \u201cEl Profesor\u201d \u2014 the former businessman, governor of Mexico State and 1976 mayor of Mexico City \u2014 who built a massive 9-foot-high, 2-feet-thick, 1,500-foot-long fieldstone wall for \u201cprivacy and security,\u201d something that could never be done today, said listing broker Danielle Malloy of Serhant.\nMalloy shares the listing with fellow Serhant broker Jessica Lane. (Gonzalez paid $875,000 for the property in 1980, according to reports.)\nCarey loved the property so much that she built a recording studio there \u2014 although it has since been transformed back into a yoga studio, Malloy said.\n\u201cIt has that timeless architecture. It\u2019s an iconic, beautiful property \u2014 like a castle,\u201d Malloy said.\nThe current sellers bought the property for $6.5 million in 2014. They then hired world-renowned architect Dinyar Wadia to undertake a three-year, $6 million renovation and expansion.\nThe stunning home was originally designed by New York architect William B. Tubby. It comes with 12 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and four powder rooms.\nThe estate now also comes with a new-construction, 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom guest house, and a 5,000-square-foot wellness center, along with a custom spa.\nCarey lived in the home with her kids, and had her staff reside in the guest house.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect home for a multi-generational family, and it is now priced to sell,\u201d Malloy said.\nThe main residence\u2019s new addition includes a new chef\u2019s kitchen, a great room with 35-foot-high ceilings, an outdoor courtyard and a study.\nWadia has said that he found inspiration for the great room from Castle Duart on the Isle of Mull \u2014 featured in \u201cEntrapment,\u201d the 1999 art-heist film starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\nThat extraordinary room boasts a double-height ceiling, a large stone fireplace and custom bronze handrails that lead to a second-story mezzanine.\nThe great room connects to the main residence via a glass-paned corridor with iron frames and divided lights \u2014 with captivating views of the garden terrace on one side, and the new chef\u2019s kitchen from the courtyard on the other. Thanks to roof lights in the kitchen and double-height bay windows in the great room, the new space is well lit.\nThe estate also boasts a wine cellar and a 14-seat movie theater.\nOutside, the property has a pool, an outdoor fireplace, formal gardens, fountains, a water wall, a gated front entrance and a basketball court.\nAdvertisement",

It out-sizes units inside owned by billionaire Ken Griffin, singer Marc Anthony and soccer legend David Beckham.\nThe full-floor penthouse, represented by Seth Semilof of HL Real Estate Group, spans 10,338 square feet with a 1,200-square-foot patio, offering panoramic views of Biscayne Bay, the Miami skyline and the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt boasts five bedrooms, 6.5 bathrooms, a private theater, a wet bar, his-and-hers bathrooms and closets, a wine cellar and custom audio-visual systems.\nHadid, the Iraqi-born British architect who became the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004, left an indelible mark with her daring deconstructivist designs, seen in landmarks like the Heydar Aliyev Centre in Baku, Azerbaijan \u2014 and Rome\u2019s MAXXI museum.\nOne Thousand Museum, her last project beforeher sudden death in 2016, redefined Miami\u2019s skyline with its sculptural exoskeleton and futuristic aesthetic.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about it is bringing someone like Zaha Hadid to Miami,\u201d Semilof said. \u201cYou really never have had that type of an architect \u2026 This building started construction pre-COVID \u2014 before the time of [big-time] architects coming down to Miami \u2014 that to me is kind of what makes this building very special.\u201d\nThe building\u2019s exclusivity draws high-profile residents, with only 84 units across its 61 floors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different in terms of product,\u201d Semilof said.\nThis rarity, combined with Hadid\u2019s visionary design, has made the tower a magnet for the elite seeking discretion and luxury.\nThe penthouse\u2019s $24 million price tag positions it as the priciest unit currently listed in the building, edging out another at $23.75 million.\nSemilof highlighted its scale: \u201cMost of the units in the building are half floors, two per floor, and then from floors 50 to 60, they\u2019re full-floor units. Our unit is the biggest unit. It\u2019s on the 51st floor, it\u2019s 10,300 square feet and then [Ken Griffin\u2019s], which is on the 58th floor, is about 9,000 square feet.\u201d\nHe described it as \u201cbasically a mansion in the sky,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s Zaha Hadid\u2019s last building and it\u2019s really the only 10,000-square-foot apartment you could get in all of downtown that\u2019s built within the last 10 years.\u201d\nHL Real Estate Group, the boutique real estate arm of Haute Living, also brokered Ridinger\u2019s original $19 million purchase of the penthouse in 2021.\nThe penthouse joins a dynamic market within One Thousand Museum.\nMarc Anthony\u2019s unit is listed for $9.9 million, while Griffin briefly put his own on the market before withdrawing it days later \u2014 one of two he owns in the building, a source told The Post.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A wave of financial strain is sweeping throughFlorida\u2019s condominium market, pushing owners to the breaking point and flooding the area with for-sale signs.\nSkyrocketing insurance premiums, unexpected repair assessments and restrictive lending practices have turned the dream of coastal living into acostly burden for many,particularly in older buildings, according to theWall Street Journal. As prices slide and sales stall, the state\u2019s once-booming condo sector faces a deepening crisis.\nRob and Karen Dickson, retirees who relocated from upstate New York to a gated Punta Gorda community in 2021, embody the struggle.\nThey purchased their third-floor condo, complete with a golf course view, for $319,000, according to the Journal.\n\u201cIt was wildly affordable,\u201d Rob told the outlet in an interview, recalling leisurely days of golf, clubhouse lunches and poolside relaxation.\nBut the idyll didn\u2019t last.\nWithin two years, a hurricane doubled their insurance costs, and a $7,200 special assessment for building upgrades hit, partially offset by $2,000 from insurance.\nMonthly homeowners\u2019 association fees jumped 25% to nearly $800, then climbed to $1,000. Unable to keep up and missing their grandchildren, they listed the condo last summer, competing against 43 other units in their community.\nThey accepted an offer $20,000 below asking and returned to New York.\n\u201cFlorida is actually paradise,\u201d Rob said. \u201cIt was superb, but things changed.\u201d\nThe Dicksons\u2019 story is far from unique. Across Florida, condo ownership costs have surged, driven by a trifecta of rising insurance rates, mandatory repair assessments and scarce financing options.\nThe fallout has triggered a sell-off, depressing prices and overwhelming the market. While South Florida\u2019s newer condos continue to appreciate \u2014 Miami-Dade County saw an 8% median price increase in February from a year earlier, fueled by corporate relocations \u2014 older properties are in free fall.\nStatewide, condo prices have declined 1% to 6% annually each month since July 2024, with a 3% drop in February, according to Florida Realtors.\nBuildings over 30 years old have seen values plummet 22% in the past two years, per ISG World, a South Florida real-estate firm, while newer condos have gained 12% over the past decade.\nThe collapse in older condo values stems largely from stringent new regulations enacted after the 2021 Surfside condo collapsethat killed 98 people.\nThese rules, requiring structural inspections and reserve funds for repairs, had a compliance deadline of December 2024. Yet, fewer than 25% of Florida\u2019s condo associations have reported meeting the standards, according to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation.\nWith Florida housing 20% of US condos \u2014 over half of which are at least 30 years old, per the UF Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies \u2014 the regulatory burden is reshaping the market.\n\u201cIf these buildings are subject to reserve requirements, buyers want to make sure they\u2019re getting into a situation where the condos have their act together,\u201d Brad O\u2019Connor, chief economist at Florida Realtors, told the Journal. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the lenders or the buyers themselves, we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in condo demands.\u201d\nFinancing woes are compounding the problem. Lenders are increasingly wary of condos, particularly those undergoing structural repairs.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t want to finance anything until the repairs are done,\u201d Anibal Torres, a mortgage lender with CMG Financial, added.\nMore than 1,400 Florida condos are on Fannie Mae\u2019s \u201cblacklist,\u201d flagged for insufficient insurance or critical repair needs, making mortgages nearly impossible to secure. Florida leads the nation in blacklisted condos, further chilling sales.\nJake Harrington, president of a 17-year-old condo board in Boynton Beach, is grappling with the consequences. His building\u2019s $7 million facade renovation, averaging $15,000 per unit, was meant to enhance value.\nInstead, a clerical error on a form \u2014 suggesting the property partly functioned as a hotel \u2014 landed it on Fannie Mae\u2019s blacklist, derailing sales.\n\u201cThis is going to be a beautiful property restored beyond its original state after we get off this project, except we\u2019re on the blacklist for a typo,\u201d Harrington told the Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating.\u201d\nThe crisis has caught the attention of state leaders. At a Miami community center, Gov. Ron DeSantis acknowledged the market\u2019s distress.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem with our condo market right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a problem that was introduced by legislation that was passed in recent years.\u201d While he signaled potential relief, no concrete measures have emerged.\nAdvertisement",

Guests they\u2019ve entertained at the winery include Priscilla Presley;\u00a0\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d contestants Kris Allen and Haley Reinhart; and Emmy-, Grammy- and Tony-winner Ben Platt.\nThe auction will be held on May 17 as the show gears up to crown America\u2019s next idol the evening of May 18 for the show\u2019s Season 23 finale.\nWarwick and Lythgoe first listed the property for $22 million in 2022.\nWarwick and Lythgoe, two childhood friends from Liverpool, England, had dreamed of owning a vineyard for years before discovering Paso Robles while driving down the Pacific Coast Highway in between auditions for \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d They fast fell in love with the area, which is halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and known for its vineyards and olive groves. It\u2019s also a mile\u00a0and a half from Paso Robles Municipal Airport.\nThey purchased the property for $5.2 million in 2005, then invested more than $12 million to tear down the original home and build two 3,700-square-foot Tuscan-style, three-bedroom villas.\nIn addition, they added a tasting room, kitchens, a pool, a pool house and replanted the vineyard, along with building wine-making facilities from scratch. There\u2019s currently a 94-acre vineyard that produces 12 varietals. There\u2019s an additional 34 acres of a fallow vineyard, currently unused, which could be replanted or used to build a boutique hotel, subject to county plans and permits.\nAnd then there are the views. The vineyard is also a popular destination for weddings, concerts and other events for up to 200 guests.\u00a0In addition, there\u2019s\u00a0a two-bedroom winemakers\u2019 cottage that is 1,040 square feet and is currently a popular Airbnb destination.\nThe producers are selling because it is time to slow down and spend time with family.\n\u201cVilla San Juliette has been an incredible chapter for us, a place of beauty and creativity. But at this stage of our lives, family has become our priority,\u201d Warwick told Gimme Shelter. \u201cWith our time increasingly split between Los Angeles and London, the practicalities of frequent travel to Paso Robles make it difficult to give the estate the attention it deserves. It\u2019s time for another family to create their own memories here.\u201d\nThe auction \u2014 organized by\u00a0Randy Haddaway, founder and CEO of Elite Auctions \u2014 includes the vineyards\u2019 inventory of award-winning bottled and bulk wine currently valued at $1.2 million.\n\u201cWalking through the vineyards at Villa San Juliette, with those breathtaking views stretching out before you, it\u2019s a world away from the hustle of LA. We\u2019ve had so many wonderful times there, sharing laughter and a glass of our own wine with friends. It\u2019s a place where you can truly unwind and reconnect. Those are the memories we\u2019ll cherish most, and we hope the next owner will create their own equally special moments,\u201d Warwick said.\nAdvertisement",

Amenities include a 24-hour doorman and a rooftop terrace with views of the city skyline and Hudson River views.\nShayk, 39, bought the Perry Street duplex for $1.96 million in 2010, according to city records. She was famously dating soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo at the time.\nShayk listed the first-floor home for $4.2 million last June. The listing got a whopping$1 million discount in December. The last recorded listing price on Zillow was $3.19 million in March.\nThe Sports Illustrated model first tried to unload the home nearly a decade ago, in late 2015, for nearly $4 million.

        "content": "New York Cityrents are continuing on their upward trajectory, and they\u2019re expected to climb even higher thanks toPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs\u2014with two boroughs set to take the biggest hit.\nWhile there is a90-day pausein effect on Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs announced earlier this month on dozens of countries, the 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that were imposed in March are still very much active.\nAnd that could spell bad news for New York City\u2019s developers and renters alike, because steel and aluminum are crucial to the construction of buildings in the nation\u2019s most populous metro perennially plagued by housing shortages.\n\u201cBy inflating building costs, these tariffs could deter builders from initiating new projects and compel developers to pause or scrap existing plans,\u201d saysRealtor.com\u00aeeconomist\u00a0Jiayi Xu\u00a0in the new New York City Rental Report.\nAmong the Big Apple\u2019s five boroughs, Manhattan and the Bronx are poised to suffer the most from the imposition of Trump\u2019s tariffs on construction materials, victims of their own success.\nLast year, the two neighborhoods registered the fastest growth rates in newly permitted multifamily homes, at 24.6% and 24.2%, respectively, compared with their 2019\u201323 averages.\nAnd because they posted the largest gains, Manhattan and the Bronx now stand to lose the most from the tariffs, which threaten to disrupt the construction of much-needed housing.\nBrooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island are not immune to the soaring development costs either. Even though the three boroughs saw a dip in permit activity, Xu says the tariffs could make things even worse by curbing new construction applications and raising rent levels across the board.\nDuring the first three months of 2025, the median asking rent in New York City increased to $3,397, an uptick of 5.6%, or $179, compared with the same period a year ago.\nRents soared across all boroughs, but true to its reputation as America\u2019s most expensive metro, Manhattan led the surge with the most dramatic increase of 5.5% year over year, or $235, driving the median asking rent up to an eye-watering $4,495 a month.\nBrooklyn, the city\u2019s most populous section, was not too far behind its more affluent neighbor to the north, with the median asking rent there climbing to $3,748, up $178, or 5%, from last spring.\nIn Queens, rents rose 4.3%, to $3,298, while the Bronx registered the most modest uptick of 0.7%, reaching $3,010. Data for Staten Island was not immediately available because it was under review.\nCompared with spring 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median asking rent in New York City was more than 18%, or $521, higher.\nMeanwhile, quarterly rental report shows that smaller units ranging from a studio to two bedrooms were in greater demand than larger apartments.\nFrom January to March, the median asking rent for 0-2 bedrooms across the city was $3,365, representing a 7.2%, or $226, surge from last year.\nMeanwhile, more sprawling rentals boasting three bedrooms or more saw a modest increase of 1.2%, or $56, reaching a median price of $4,773.\nA zoomed-out look at the city\u2019s rental market from the pre-pandemic era to the beginning of 2025 reveals an unexpected twist: The lower-cost boroughs saw the largest percentage increases in rent.\nThe Bronx saw the most drastic increase in median asking rents over the past five years, at a staggering 41.2%, followed by Brooklyn with a nearly 40% surge, pointing to rapidly growing demand in these traditionally more affordable areas.\nOn the other hand, high-priced Manhattan saw its median asking rents shimmy up by just 0.2% since the beginning of 2020.\nNew York City might be the concrete jungle where dreams are made, but living there does not come cheap, as the Realtor.com report shows.\nTo afford renting a typical unit in four of the five boroughs, excluding Staten Island, while following the 30% income rule of thumb, which recommends people spend no more than 30% of their gross monthly income on housing costs, tenants would need to bring in between $10,000 and $15,000 per month.\nPredictably, renting an apartment in Manhattan calls for the highest monthly income of $14,983, followed closely by Brooklyn, with $12,493.\nQueens and the Bronx are slightly more affordable, so renters there have to make $10,933 and $10,033, respectively.\nThis translates to annual household incomes of $179,796 in Manhattan, $149,916 in Brooklyn, $131,196 in Queens, and $120,396 in the Bronx.\nThe trouble is that actual median household incomes across the boroughs fall dramatically short of what\u2019s recommended, with gaps ranging from about 61% in Queens to a stunning 161% in the Bronx, forcing tenants to spend well over 30% on housing and utilities just to keep a roof over their heads.",

I\u2019ve never seen my dog so happy,\u201d Paulson told the outlet of discovering the charming locale. \u201cSo I actually really got the house for my dog.\u201d\nThe listing, which included a golf cart in the deal, described the trailer park home as a \u201cjewel box.\u201d\nThe trailer\u2019s transom windows bring in ample natural light to the white-washed kitchen, the highlight of which are sea foam and emerald green-veined marble countertops. Brass hardware dots the home and blush-pink tiles line the bathroom from floor to ceiling. A lofted area allows for extra sleeping space and the backyard area offers a slice of privacy from the rest of the park.\nThe mauve home went back on the market in May 2024 for a whopping $2 million, but the Emmy-winning actress was forced to drop the asking price more than once, down to $1.57 million in March.\nPaulson briefly delisted the home earlier this year after the Palisades Fire wrought major damage on areas surrounding the mobile park, including another tony trailer park, Tahitian Terrace Mobile Home Park, where Barbara Corcoran\u2019s $1 million double-wide trailer was completely destroyed.\nWhile a $1.45 million sale price is far from paltry, Paulson\u2019s pad is by no means the most expensive residence in Paradise Cove Mobile Home Park.\nThere are currently six homes on sale in the community, according to Realtor.com, all of which are priced above $1.2 million and one of which \u2014\u00a0a two bedroom trailer \u2014 is listed for just under $5 million.\nThe trailer park, situated atop a seaside bluff,has been gentrifyingsince the early 2000s, as wealthy surfing hobbyists have discovered the once-blue-collar community\u2019s proximity to a popular surfing cove.The explosion in this trailer park\u2019s popularity among the shabby-chic-loving bourgeoisie makes it a cross-coastal twin toMontauk Shoreson the eastern tip of Long Island, another trailer park community popular among surfers and increasingly owned by deep pocketed buyers willing to shell out millions for a 1,200-square-foot trailer.\nAdvertisement",

The need is so great that the hospital leapt over enormous logistical and financial hurdles to make it reality: The units were built in a factory in western Pennsylvania, transported by truck and then boat to the island, and then stacked on a sloping, 28-acre parcel. The cost? $38 million so far.This is the reality of operating a hospital in one of the most housing-starved places on the planet. Housing is in such short supply here \u2014 the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Commission estimates the rent for a typical one-bedroom is around $3,000 \u2014 that many employers can\u2019t keep workers, even for essential health care jobs, unless they help pay for, or build, housing.Advertisement\u201cEvery time a house goes up for sale on the Vineyard, one of our employees becomes housing insecure,\u201d Schepici said. \u201cIt is one of our greatest challenges \u2014 keeping people housed.\u201dMartha's Vineyard Hospital is building a 48-unit housing development on Edgartown-Vineyard Haven Road for its workers. The project is being constructed using units that are constructed off site, then shipped to the Vineyard.Martha's Vineyard Hospital, Columbia ConstructionSchepici has had a vision for a hospital-financed housing development since she was hired as chief executive in 2018. The nonprofit hospital, which is part of Mass General Brigham, has been steadily losing staff who either move off the island because their year-round rental was converted into a vacation property, or because they have grown sick of commuting by ferry from the mainland (where costs on Cape Cod are high, too) every day for work. Several times a week, chief administrative officer Michael Cosgrave said, hospital executives hear from an employee who is losing their apartment or struggling to find an affordable rental.The erosion of housing affordability on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, according to the commission, has become a full-blown crisis. Few homes sell for under $1 million these days, and only one in four properties on the island is a rental, many of which are offered mainly to vacationers. Some 40 percent of year-round households on the island are considered housing cost-burdened. That means much of the island\u2019s workforce commutes from the mainland, making the 45-minute sojourn from Woods Hole each day, or from other ports.Related: From 2022: Martha\u2019s Vineyard was portrayed as rich, white, and elite, but there\u2019s another side to the islandThe hospital has responded by acquiring a portfolio of homes they own or lease, enough to house a small portion of its employees, though they have to compete for properties with other big employers that are grappling with the same staffing issues, like Stop and Shop.AdvertisementBut that is a Band-Aid on a much larger problem, Cosgrave said.The idea of a hospital-built housing project was more hope than reality until 2019, when Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital struck an initial agreement with the wealthy Norton family, who have owned property on the island for generations, to purchase 28 acres on Edgartown-Vineyard Haven Road for $3.6 million.To put a building on that land, they had another ambitious idea: Construction on the Vineyard is a challenge because many commonly used building materials must be shipped by barge, adding time and expense to most larger-scale projects. Could the hospital build modular units in a factory and have them shipped to the Vineyard prefabricated?Indeed, each of the 48 units was built in a factory near Pittsburgh complete with appliances, countertops, and finishes. They were then loaded onto trucks and driven to New Bedford, where they were taken by barge, one at a time, to the Vineyard, then loaded onto another truck and placed into foundations by crane at the site. Altogether, each unit traveled roughly 600 miles.\u201cThere is a tremendous amount of work that goes into building a project like this on the Vineyard,\u201d said Neil Lemieux, the director of preconstruction at Columbia Construction, the project\u2019s general contractor. \u201cWhere are you getting your materials and your workers from? Believe it or not, it\u2019s easier to build these units off-site and ship them here.\u201dEach unit was shipped to the Vineyard in the form of prefabricated \"boxes,\" which were assembled together to form apartment buildings.Martha's Vineyard Hospital, Columbia ConstructionAt the site, the \u201cboxes\u201d transported to the island were fit together to create duplex units, townhomes, and an apartment building, and stacked and clamped together with 10-inch screws that are still visible in the hallways of the buildings.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s like a giant jigsaw puzzle,\u201d Lemieux said.On a breezy day earlier this month, each of the boxes were in place, with crews busily applying finishing touches, assembling decks, and laying concrete sidewalks. The units are modern \u2014 like you\u2019d see in an expensive building in Greater Boston \u2014 complete with new appliances, in-unit laundry, and personal decks. In the middle of the site, an elder care facility, which will have 70 skilled nursing beds, was in the late stages of construction.The project was initially estimated to cost around $25 million, but the rise in construction costs during and since the pandemic added roughly $13 million. While much of that cost will be covered by donors, the hospital is not expecting the project to be a \u201cmoney-maker,\u201d Cosgrave said.The building is on track to open in June, when the first new residents will move in. But even 48 new units won\u2019t meet the demand. The units will be awarded to hospital employees through a lottery conducted by the local housing authority, and selected residents will have their rents subsidized based on their income. No employee, the hospital says, will pay more than 30 percent of their income toward rent.The hope, Cosgrave said, is that by opening the development, they\u2019ll spark something of a chain reaction, freeing up some year-round rentals that are occupied by staff members, and getting more employees into stable homes. Any sort of dent in the problem will help, even if it\u2019s a relatively small one for a big cost.\u201cOf course we\u2019re extremely proud of this project, and feel like we\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do for our employees,\u201d Schepici said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that, as a hospital, we have to do this for our operations. Our doctors and nurses need homes.\u201dAdvertisementAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.",

        "content": "A contemporary residence standing at the gateway to Jeff Bezos\u2019ssprawling Warner Estatein Beverly Hills has listed for $19.8 million \u2014 offering a rare opportunity to live adjacent to one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people,Mansion Global reports.\nThe Amazon titan acquired the neighboring 9-acre property for$165 million in 2020.\nThis new listing, a three-story architectural gem on Angelo Drive, presents a striking contrast to the historic grandeur of Bezos\u2019s Georgian Revival mansion, originally built in 1939 for Hollywood titan Jack Warner.\nSpanning approximately 10,000 square feet, the newly listed modern home, completed in 2021, was designed by Gabbay Architects for its current owner, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who purchased the land for $4.1 million in 2015, according to Mansion Global.\nThe residence showcases sophisticated design elements, including a dramatic central staircase that weaves through all three levels, forming a sculptural, eye-like spiral.\nA towering black marble fireplace anchors the living space, complemented by herringbone hardwood floors, grayscale marble accents in the kitchen and bathrooms, and expansive windows that flood the interior with natural light.\nThe property is tailored for both luxury and entertainment, boasting five bedrooms, a home theater, a bar and lounge \u2014 plus a 15-car garage.\nOutdoors, a pool with floating benches serves as the centerpiece, surrounded by an al-fresco kitchen and a dining area.\nA living room with sliding glass doors opens seamlessly to the pool deck, creating an ideal setting for Southern California\u2019s indoor-outdoor lifestyle. Mature olive trees surround the property.\nListed on Friday through Tomer Fridman of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, the Benedict Canyon property is a bit of a bargain when it comes to living next to Bezos.\nBy comparison, a vacant lot neighboring Bezos\u2019s estate on Indian Creek Island in Florida is currentlypriced at $150 million.\nThe Warner Estate itself, previously owned by music mogul David Geffen, includes a palatial mansion designed by architect Florence Yoch, reflecting its storied Hollywood legacy.\n\u201cThis property offers a rare opportunity to own a sleek, contemporary residence at the entrance to one of Beverly Hills\u2019 most iconic estates,\u201d Fridman said in a statement. \u201cWith its striking design and proximity to Jeff Bezos\u2019s $165 million compound, it stands as a testament to the allure and exclusivity of this prestigious neighborhood.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

The median-priced single-family house in the region sold for $930,000 in March, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors, up 3.3 percent from the same month last year.So, yes, buying here is still hard. But there was also one positive glimmer: The number of homes on the market in March, jumped significantly, perhaps an early indication that the region\u2019s housing market may be stirring from a three-year-long malaise.\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see the inventory number rise... as we enter into the spring market as our eager buyer population has been patient throughout the winter,\u201d said GBAR President Mark Triglione, the owner of Premier Realty Group, Inc. in Reading.More than 1,300 single-family homes were newly listed for sale last month in GBAR\u2019s coverage area, which includes most of Greater Boston except for the North and South Shores, a 31 percent jump from March 2024. Overall inventory is up 35 percent.Spring is typically the time of year when the housing market begins to kick into gear, so the spike in listings is not new. But for the last three years, the spring market has been significantly depressed.Related: Spring is usually a busy time for home-buying. Not in Greater Boston.AdvertisementInterest rates more than doubled in 2022, effectively grinding the housing market to a halt. Higher rates have created something of a stalemate in the market because they translate directly to increased monthly housing payments. Would-be sellers do not want to sell because they don\u2019t want to give up a relatively low mortgage rate on their current place for a much higher one on a new place.AdvertisementThat has stifled buyers, too, because there are fewer homes to choose from, and the homes that are available come with both high price tags, and high monthly payments.Last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.83 percent, according to Freddie Mac. That means the monthly payment on a house is still more than double what it was three years ago.The question for brokers and economists over that period has been whether or not the market will start moving again even if rates don\u2019t fall. Perhaps, some thought, buyers and sellers would eventually accept higher interest rates as a new reality, and the recent spike in listings may indicate that at least some sellers are jumping back in.But not all signs are positive. The number of closed sales fell 14 percent from March 2024, according to GBAR.Statewide, sales of single-family homes dipped roughly 4 percent, according to the Warren Group, a real estate analytics firm. Condominium sales fell by over 14 percent in Greater Boston, and 3 percent statewide.And the pressures on the market aren\u2019t going away. Prices keep climbing, shutting out more and more lower and middle class prospective buyers, a trend which shows no sign of relenting. Ongoing economic uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs may be discouraging buyers, too.\u201cGiven the current state of the federal government, it\u2019s impossible to predict what interest rates will do, or whether inflation will continue to constrain the buying power of prospective homeowners,\u201d said Cassidy Norton, The Warren Group\u2019s associate publisher and media relations director.Triglione is cautiously optimistic.\u201cProspective buyers are still having to walk a tough road to successfully purchase a high-quality property,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hopefully the influx of inventory will provide more balance to the market than there has been in recent years.\u201dAdvertisementAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "This thoughtful Lower East Side aerie has some extra good vibes \u2014 thanks to buried crystals and precious stones throughout the abode to bring harmony home.\nNow this apartment combo at 367 Grand St. is on the market for $2.6 million in the Seward Park Cooperative buildings. The three-bedroom, 2\u00bd-bathroom home is 2,000 square feet and comes with 140 square feet of outside space.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always so much fun to take separate apartments and combine them. It\u2019s like \u2018Tetris,'\u201d holistic and feng shui architect and interior designer Anjie Cho told Gimme Shelter.\nThe home boasts an open living/dining area and a chef\u2019s kitchen.\nIt opens with a large foyer that leads to an open living space.\nA main bedroom suite comes with two custom walk-in closets and an ensuite windowed bath. Details include white oak floors, hidden internet/tech equipment and lots of storage.\nIn addition to looking good and functioning well, this project was also about \u201cexploring how to bring in the intentions for happiness, health and prosperity\u201d for the client, Cho said.\n\u201cWe aligned them\u00a0with the chakras,\u201d said Cho, who is author of \u201cHolistic Spaces,\u201d \u201cMindful Homes\u201d and co-author of\u201cMindful Living.\u201d\n\u201cOne cool thing we did in the home is place crystals in the walls of the bathroom. In feng shui, bathrooms can be challenging for the qi (life force energy) and so we brought in crystals to bring in support to transform the energy.\u201d\nCho also focused in creating \u201ca spacious and inviting foyer.\u201d\nIn feng shui, Cho explained, the entry is the source of all the qi in your home and life, bringing opportunities\u00a0and positive energy.\n\u201cWe made sure it was spacious and inviting,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not great to walk into a home and face the windows, so we created a wall slightly off center with a focal point for beautiful art, but with enough room so that the qi could collect within the space.\u201d (Sometimes, she explained, when the front door is aligned with a window, it is considered unfavorable because the qi can rush out, rather than gather in the space.)\nThe home is also surrounded by greenery, said\u00a0listing broker Jerry Carlucci of Oxford Property Group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you are living in a tree house,\u201d Carlucci said. \u201cFeng shui nature is very important, and having that infused within the built environment is important.\u201d\nWhile Carlucci isn\u2019t a feng shui expert, he added: \u201cFeng Shui is more complex than what I know. But from my perspective, I think New York can be a hostile\u00a0environment\u00a0and our homes act as our refuge. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I get people who simply want a peaceful living environment. It has become the same luxury as an in-unit washer/dryer \u2014 which isn\u2019t a luxury\u00a0in most of the country!\u201d\nIf Gimme readers are feeling a desire to bring some feng shui into their own homes, spring is a good time to do so, because that\u2019s when the wood element qi begins to rise.\n\u201cThe energy\u00a0is stirring and pushing upward through the ground. Soon, we will have new growth all around us in the form of spring flowers. This burst of spring energy is a perfect time to work on your home with feng shui,\u201d Cho said.\nPro tip: At home, Cho said, incorporate feng shui intentions into spring cleaning by turning it into a meaningful ceremony\u00a0and invite \u201ceven more significant energy shifts into our lives.\u201d\nSet up an intention for yourself or your home. Incorporate the metal element by using a bell or an object with a clear ringing sound and use it wherever you want, or move to the center of your home and ring the bell nine times.\n\u201cEach time you ring the bell, feel the vibrations move through not only your home but also through you,\u201d Cho said.\nAdvertisement",

The couple used it as a pied-\u00e0-terre,according to Architectural Digest, and undertook extensive gut renovations led by architect Louis Lisboa of VL Architects and interior designer Susanna Maggard.\nThe 4,000-square-foot condo boasts 13-foot ceilings, Venetian plaster walls, custom moldings and mosaic tilework.\nOversize windows flood the home with light and provide far-flung views of Central Park, Grand Army Plaza and Fifth Avenue.\nResidents at the Plaza Private Residences enjoy the hotel\u2019s amenities including butler services, 24-hour in-room dining and twice-a-day housekeeping.\nWright lived in the spacious apartment from 1954 to 1959 with his wife Olgivanna Lloyd Wright. The duo entertained the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Arthur Miller and King Faisal II of Iraq while in residence, and oversaw their own overhaul of the interiors.\nThe concrete spiral structure of the Guggenheim \u2014 the design for which Wright unveiled to the public at the Plaza \u2014 is also one of the architect\u2019s most famous works.

Ackman had acquired the unit in 2017 for $13.5 million \u2014 a record for the building at the time.\nOccupying nearly 3,000 square feet, the home is newly renovated, according to the listing.

The pair, units 8E and 8F, were purchased eight years ago for a combined $22 million shortly after his divorce from landscape architect Karen Ackman.\nThe second unit, 8E, remains on the market, listed at just under its $8.5 million purchase price.\nAckman\u2019s history with the Beresford runs deep.\nIn 2006, he and Karen purchased a 17th-floor co-op in the building for $26 million.

He\u2019s finished in the trade magazineScotsman Guide\u2019s top five best loan originators in the country for the last 10 years, most often in the number 1 spot.\n\nIn 2024, he made 1,045 loans totaling more than $581 million. Home purchases made up 94 percent, and 6 percent was refinancing.\n\nOn March 5, Rate (formerly Guaranteed Rate) chief executive Victor Ciardelli announced Banosian had been namedpresident of Rate Mortgage, a Chicago-based lender with more than 300 branch offices nationwide.\n\nWe spoke to Banosian about his plans in his new role and the future of mortgage lending.\n\nQ.Will you continue to do loan origination while serving as president of Rate?\n\nA.Yes, I\u2019ll do both. I\u2019m the first president in the history of the company. Our CEO, Victor Ciardelli, has done an amazing job building an innovative company. He\u2019s always pushed us to get better, and he\u2019s going to remain in that role as a visionary and leader of the company. My job is to work closely on the mortgage side of the business, to continue to move that forward, and work with the people in our different offices.\n\nThe mortgage business is changing every single day. One thing I\u2019ve proven over the course of my career is that I can change with it and stay ahead of the competition, stay relevant. I want to help our loan originators do the same thing. But in order for me to do that, not only do I have to work with our sales force, but I have to work with all the other departments that support our sales force for marketing and branding and operations.\n\nQ.About a week after Rate announced you were being promoted to president,Rocket Mortgageannounced it was buying theRedfinreal estate company. How do you think that will impact the industry?\n\nA.I didn\u2019t see that coming, but I understand why they\u2019re interested in doing it. It could be a really smart solution. Rocket has always been consumer-direct. And Redfin\u2019s portal is the best in real estate to get consumers\u2019 eyeballs. Everybody uses Redfin\u2019s portal to search for properties \u2014 even real estate agents at other companies. Now they can get to the consumer immediately as they begin to look for homes.\n\nIt\u2019s the start of what could be a vertically integrated home solution. They\u2019ll get the consumer as soon as they start looking for homes and offer them financing. They also offer title services and home insurance services. If they\u2019re able to pull it off, it could be really great, and ultimately, might lead to more competitive offerings across all the different services for the homeowner.\n\nCompanies likeZillowhave also been trying to figure out the same thing. We have always historically been a company that works directly with our clients. We do a really great job maintaining a really long life cycle with our clients once we do business with them.\n\nQ.Do you have any new initiatives planned for Rate?\n\nA.Going forward, we want people to think of us regarding anything with an interest rate. That\u2019s our goal. Right now, we offer mortgages, personal loans, home equity lines, home equity loans, and home insurance. Eventually, we hope to be able to offer things like credit cards, car loans, and student loans. It opens us up to be able to be a one-stop shop for borrowing consumers.\n\nQ.What challenges do you foresee in maintaining your current business and acting as president of Rate?\n\nA.Managing my time, first, but also, we\u2019re a large organization spread all across the country, and I\u2019m one of those people who wants to make an immediate impact. I\u2019ve just got to be patient. I\u2019m trying to get out in front of everybody as much as possible, in person, obviously utilizing technology as well.\n\nBut I have to stay patient in terms of making all the different connections I want to make with people. And then, the market is always going to throw things at you that you can\u2019t prepare for. Generally, the thing that is the biggest issue of the year is something nobody forecasted, like COVID or in 2022 when interest rates more than doubled from around 3 percent to over 7 percent in 10 months.\n\nQ.Where do you see mortgage interest rates going for the rest of this year?\n\nA. I believe that interest rates will come down toward the end of this year, as the Fed likely cuts two to three more times. Right now, Wall Street is predicting pricing in three rate cuts for later this year, which could also be a good time for some people to refinance. However, if these tariffs stay in effect and aren\u2019t able to be negotiated, it could lead to inflation. If inflation spikes up, then rates will go up, and that would be bad for buyers and people looking to refinance.\n\nQ.What does it take to qualify for a mortgage in this market?\n\nA.Get financially prepared. A lender is always going to want to review your credit, income, and assets. Those are the three qualifying factors at every bank and mortgage institution. They should be able to help you understand what the best rates and products are, what you need for credit requirements.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of misconceptions around down payments. People think they need 20 percent down. There\u2019s a lot of great first-time homebuyer programs with 3 percent down and down payment assistance programs and things of that nature.\n\nQ.Your office is decorated with lots of Boston sports memorabilia and you make a lot of sports analogies. Is that how you approach your work?\n\nA.Yes. Teamwork, competition, practice, all those things are things that I grew up valuing. It\u2019s really helped me get the right mindset to figure out all the work that goes into having a successful business. It\u2019s the stuff that goes on behind the scenes that nobody sees.\n\nYou have to learn how to win, learn how to come back from losses, having a strategy, but also then knowing that things aren\u2019t going to go according to plan and being prepared to react accordingly. I also look at every new year as a new opportunity.\n\nOver my career, we\u2019ve had amazing markets and super challenging markets, but there\u2019s been opportunity in all of them, whether it\u2019s to gain market share or to better serve our clients or better serve our partners, and doing work that allows us to stand out.\n\nI tell people as a child, I wanted to be a professional athlete. I feel like I became a professional athlete, except my sport of choice is now mortgage and housing. There\u2019s nothing more fulfilling than listening to someone, having them list what their obstacles and challenges are, and then helping come up with a solution, having them implement changes, and then getting feedback from them that it\u2019s making a difference.\n\nJim Morrison can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].

Andthere are no property taxes on this open land just 10 miles from the Hub.\n\nLocated on Fells Road, this expansive Cape is just about five house lots from the Fells Road Path, a gateway into theMiddlesex Fells Reservationand its miles of trails, woods, and water.\n\nFrom the sidewalk, a blacktopped driveway leads to the right side of the home and the one-car garage underneath. About midway, a multilevel stone and brick stairway rises to the covered porch and front door.\n\nFirst inside is the foyer, where natural light arrives through an oval window on the right wall. Directly ahead is the stairwell to the top two floors, and on the left and behind a sliding pocket door is a half bath with ceramic tile flooring and a white porcelain pedestal sink.\n\nMoving to the right, there is the 218-square-foot living room with a pair of double-hung windows, hardwood flooring, and crown molding. A wood-burning fireplace is embedded into a chimney column, which is the only barrier to the formal dining room.\n\n\nA short hallway at the end of the living room \u2014 just past a doorway to the kitchen \u2014 connects to the primary suite. The bedroom is 384 square feet, and the bed itself nestles into a large nook in one corner underneath a double-hung window and recessed lighting. The room is easily large enough to create a spot for seating, and is brightened by two more double-hung windows. The single-door closet is 30 square feet and has built-in shelving.\n\n\n\nA door from the bedroom connects to the private bath. It\u2019s 92 square feet and has a single white vanity, ceramic tile flooring, and flowery wallpaper. There is a shower/bath combination with a white subway tile backsplash.\n\nReturning to the public spaces, the hardwood flooring continues in the 282-square-foot dining room, where a triple set of windows is on the right side and a single window on the opposite wall. A central light fixture marks the spot for the table, and a chair rail around the room adds a sense of refinement.\n\n\nAt the end of this room is the entry into a secondary bedroom. It\u2019s 245 square feet, has windows on three exterior walls, hardwood floors, and built-in shelving behind a pair of sliding doors.\n\nAlso from the dining room, a separate doorway leads to the 154-square-foot kitchen. Two levels of rustic wooden cabinets line the right side of the space. The countertop is blue granite, andthe backsplash is white tile with decorative pineapples. The sink is nicely positioned under a trio of rectangular windows. Appliances \u2014 including the electric stove \u2014 are white, and the flooring is hardwood.\n\n\nFrom the kitchen, a door opens to the 137-square-foot sunroom, offering a bug-free environment in the screened-in space for stargazing through two skylights. One can also sip coffee and ponder the number of stones in the classic New England retaining walls. A door connects to a rear deck if there is an interest in closer examination of the terraced backyard.\n\n\nBack in the foyer and up the stairs, a French door guards access to the top level and the final bedroom, a sitting area and office, a full bath, and the 480-square-foot walk-in attic.\n\nThe bedroom is 167 square feet and has four storage areas. The bath has ceramic tile flooring, a counter with an embedded sink, and a toilet. Separately, in a room next to it, is a shower insert behind a curtain.\n\nThe basement is partially finished with flooring and small above-ground windows and wall paneling painted white. The centerpiece is a working wood fireplace with a wood mantle surrounded by shelving. There is a separate laundry room with space for full-size appliances. Flooring in these two rooms is tile. There is a half bath with a single white vanity.\n\n\nThe home has central air conditioning and oil heat.\n\nSven Andersen of Andersen Group Realty Keller Williams Luxury Internationalhas the listing.\n\nJohn R.

        "subhead": "The acquisition price of 99 High St. is $100 million off the city\u2019s assessed value of the 32-story tower",
        "content": "In what has widely been viewed as a bellwether transaction for the beleaguered downtown office market, Boston real estate firm Synergy has closed on its long-anticipated acquisition of the 32-story tower at 99 High St. on Thursday for $227 million.Synergy is assuming the mortgage from MetLife Real Estate Lending LLC, according to Suffolk County property records. It\u2019s acquiring the 730,000-square-foot tower for 17 percent less than the $273 million the building\u2019s prior owner, Nuveen \u2014 the real estate arm of teachers\u2019 retirement behemoth TIAA \u2014 paid two decades years ago, and for $100 million less than the tower\u2019s assessed value of $327.7 million.\u201cThis is one of the best buildings on the market that\u2019s not new construction,\u201d said Synergy CEO Dave Greaney in an interview.99 High fronts the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, with its upper floors boasting views of both the Greenway, the Boston Harbor and Fort Point Channel. The tower is the second downtown office tower to sell since the pandemic and is widely considered key indicator for downtown office values. It is 78 percent occupied with tenants including Mercer, Marsh McLennan, AIG, and Karuna Therapeutics.Synergy won the bid to acquire the tower back in November, but the complicated transaction just closed this week. A $227 million deal equates to about $311 per square foot, $63 less than TIAA paid in April 2005 for the property.Advertisement\u201cThat new per-square-foot (rate) in the low $300s is turning out to be the new normal as of late, especially for a building sale of this size,\u201d said Dion Sorrentino, the associate director of market analytics with real estate data firm CoStar Group in Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s well located. It\u2019s near transit. It\u2019s downtown. It has a decent tenant base in it. This is what we\u2019d expect to trade in a normal market.\u201dAdvertisementSynergy CEO Dave Greaney on High Street earlier this month.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe StaffAs more office buildings come on the market this year, their values are being closely watched, in no small part due to the implications for Boston\u2019s property tax base and $4.8 billion city budget. More than two-thirds of city revenue comes from property taxes, much of it on large commercial buildings. If their value falls, so too could revenue needed to pay for city services.Synergy has been among the few buyers of downtown commercial office space since the COVID-19 pandemic upended office markets. Since late 2023, Synergy has acquired 101 Arch St. \u2014 for 36 percent less than the building\u2019s prior purchase price \u2014 1 Liberty Square (17 percent less), and 179 Lincoln St. (40 percent less). The pricing for the 99 High St. could be echoed in the forthcoming sale of the joint towers at 75-101 Federal St., Sorrentino said.Greaney said it\u2019s never been more difficult to secure debt financing to buy an office building, but that some equity investors who have shied away from the sector in recent years have started to reconsider it as \u201can acceptable asset class\u201d now that prices have fallen.\u201cThey feel that the basis has fallen to a point where it makes sense and justifies the risk, and that the fundamentals are looking like they may improve,\u201d Greaney said. \u201cInstitutional equity will always have a place in quality office assets in gateway cities.\u201dFor its part, Nuveen invested at least $24 million in upgrades to 99 High St. in the past decade, including a 2019 lobby renovation designed by architecture firm SGA. A leasing brochure from brokerage CBRE, dated to last May, touts the tower\u2019s monthly tenant appreciation events and a building app, \u201c16 new high-speed, high-efficiency elevators\u201d and \u201cbelow market electric costs.\u201dAdvertisementAt 32 stories, 99 High St. is the tallest building Synergy\u2019s ever acquired, Greaney said. But he\u2019s got his eye on others.\u201cI think anybody who has an office building that\u2019s a good size, good asset, good location\u201a we should be talking to them, if we\u2019re not talking to them already,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see an avalanche of deals coming, but I do know of a half-dozen deals that are going to come on the market this year.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "David Weinreb, the former chief executive of Howard Hughes Corp., has put his West Chelsea penthouse on the market for an eye-popping $75 million \u2014 positioning it among the most expensive properties in downtown Manhattan.\nThe sprawling condo, located at 551 W. 21st St., blends bespoke design with high-end finishes, including a kitchen crafted by renowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and reflects a growing trend of ultra-luxury sales in the area.\nIt also features a large private swimming pool, considered \u201cthe largest private outdoor pool in New York City,\u201d the listing says.\nWeinreb, who took Howard Hughes public and led the company for nearly a decade before stepping down in 2019, acquired the 6,500-square-foot raw space in 2017 for $38 million, according to theWall Street Journal, which first reported on the listing.\nNow chairman and CEO of Weinreb Ventures, a real-estate investment firm, he initially listed the unfinished unit in 2021 for just below $50 million.\nAfter 10 months without a buyer, he opted to complete the construction.\n\u201cI believed in the design and knew that completing it was the right thing for the home,\u201d Weinreb told the Journal in an email.\n\u201cI wish I was spending more time in Manhattan,\u201d Weinreb said of his decision to part ways with the unit.\nHe\u2019s also parting ways with a splashy hangout, now perfect for the weather getting better.\n\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, it\u2019s the largest private pool in the city,\u201d Compass listing broker Clayton Orrigo, who is marketing the property alongside Stephen Ferrara, told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s 61 feet long. I\u2019ve never seen a pool nearly as big. They\u2019re usually very difficult to build. This one is gigantic.\u201d\nIn addition to its length, the pool stands 10 feet wide and 4 feet deep.\n\u201cPools are usually half the size of that. It\u2019s very difficult from a weight standpoint,\u201d Orrigo added. \u201cBasically a developer would have to build it to spec right out of the gate. It\u2019s not something you can add on just given the weight of the water. So it was a thoughtful design from day one.\u201d\nThe finished penthouse overall is a testament to meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe kitchen, designed by Vongerichten, a close friend of Weinreb\u2019s, features an 87-inch Lacanche dual-oven range with brass and enamel accents, complemented by Gaggenau appliances \u2014 including an espresso machine, a steam oven and a wine cabinet.\n\u201cThis is my idea of a dream kitchen,\u201d Vongerichten said in an email to the Journal.\nElsewhere, the residence boasts \u201cmuseum quality\u201d finishes, according to Orrigo.\nNotable details include 12-foot-tall, 4-inch-thick brass-clad doors to the primary suite, each weighing approximately 800 pounds, and a primary bathroom with vanities carved from Italian marble.\nThe penthouse offers five bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, and expansive views of the Hudson River, the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building with floor-to-ceiling windows throughout.\nA sculptural staircase leads to a 4,600-square-foot private rooftop terrace, complete with the swimming pool, a full bathroom, a built-in grill and soft turf.\nMeanwhile, the building itself, designed by Foster + Partners, includes amenities such as a gated courtyard, a 20-foot green wall, a fitness center, a yoga room and a residents\u2019 lounge.\nThe listing arrives amid a wave of high-profile transactions in downtown Manhattan. In March, a $60 million sale at 150 Charles St. set a new condo record for the area.\u00a0If this home sells for its asking price, it will more than surpass that deal.\nOther notable deals include a $57.5 million penthouse at a converted Perry Street garage that went into contract last year, with another unit in the same building asking roughly $85 million.\n\u201cIt is a bit of a new norm,\u201d Orrigo told the Journal. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a one-off apartment that\u2019s $75 million.\u2019 There\u2019s a whole class of these right now.\u201d\nUnlike many new developments in the neighborhood still under construction, Weinreb\u2019s penthouse is move-in ready, a key advantage for buyers seeking immediate occupancy.\n\u201cIf someone wants to transact and wants to move in immediately, there\u2019s not a lot to buy,\u201d Orrigo added.\nAdvertisement",

While prices may remain high, FOX5 reported one home that was only on the market for 41 days saw a price drop of $45,000.\nThe rise in new listings has been fueled by the area\u2019s high concentration of federal employees impacted by the Trump administration\u2019s new policies,FOX Business previously reported, citing Redfin agents.\nThe\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, which aimed to eliminate wasteful government spending by trimming the federal workforce, has slashed thousands of jobs across agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service.\nIn addition, buyout offers were accepted by nearly 75,000 employees, Fox News Digital previously reported.\nReturn-to-office mandateshave also affected the real estate market. FOX Business previously reported that a DC-area couple who had to return to the office sought to list their home in the hopes of finding another home closer to public transportation.\nThe abundance of homes for sale presents an opportunistic moment for buyers.\n\u201cDevelopers are buying these homes because they\u2019re reasonably priced,\u201d northwest DC resident Robin Roth told FOX5. \u201cThey develop them, put a third story on and away they go.\u201d\nWhile new listings have increased dramatically, the housing market is still performing below pre-pandemic levels, Sturtevant said.\nDC Mayor Muriel Bowser also said she believes the capital\u2019s\u00a0real estate\u00a0market still has room to grow, according to the outlet.\n\u201cI remain very optimistic about the downtown, very bullish about the future of the District of Columbia,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWe have laid out a plan, we\u2019ve delivered on the plan, we continue to have people come forward with ideas.\u00a0We continue to attract partners and continue to make investments.\u201dFox News\u2019 Alexandra Koch contributed to this report.",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "This Mediterranean revival estate near Los Angeles has a lot to brag about.\nThe home in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge was designed in 1927 by trailblazing architect Paul R. Williams, the designer of iconic commercial buildings and residences across California and the first African-American member of the American Institute of Architects. The residence later served as a retreat for Golden Age Hollywood actor Dennis Morgan. On top of its Californian bona fides, the sprawling property boasts an super-sized swimming pool.\nNow, this 1.2-acre estate can be yours for $8.5 million \u2014 marking its first sale in decades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a truly magnificent, almost fossilized home,\u201d Compass agent George Penner told The Post. \u201cIt captures the spirit of Hollywood and Los Angeles in the 1930s.\u201d\nThe primary estate residence, designed by Williams, includes four bedrooms across 8,156 square feet. Painstakingly crafted details are sprinkled throughout the home, including hand-painted stenciled ceilings, black and white marble floors, tile mosaics and stained glass.\nSpecialty rooms include a paneled library, a music room and a basement wine cellar.\nThe estate\u2019s grounds, nestled in the foothills of the Verdugo Mountains, includes a garden, two greenhouses, a one-bedroom casita and a faux bois tea house built by a Japanese artisan in 1929. A two-bedroom guest house features a look-out \u201cobservatory\u201d and a two-car garage.\nThen, there\u2019s the swimming pool.\n\u201cEveryone seems to comment about the Olympic-size pool, because it\u2019s so unusual to have such an enormous, opulent pool for a single family home,\u201d Penner said.\nArchitect Paul R. Williams built the residence early in his career for attorney James Degnan.\u00a0Williams went on to design homes for the likes of Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball.\n\u201c[Williams] was a real trailblazer, and certainly the most prolific African-American architect of the 20th century, certainly in California,\u201d Penner said. \u201cTo do work of this incredible level in 1927 is, I think, extraordinary.\u201d\nGina Guerra has lived in the home with her family since they purchased it for $2.07 million in 1999. The Guerras inherited the home\u2019s well-preserved \u2014 but \u201cquite run down\u201d \u2014 architectural details, like original tiling and light fixtures, alongside stories of Errol Flynn partying on the property.\nGuerra told The Post that the family focused on restoration, rather than renovation, through their years of ownership, although upgrades to the kitchen and bathrooms were necessary.\nGuerra added the property\u2019s expansive green space and multiple greenhouses turned her into an avid gardener.\n\u201cI\u2019m now in the Garden Club of America judging program for horticulture, so it really took me down this whole path that I never expected in my life,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cI hope another family moves in, raises their kids here and loves it the way we do.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Recent construction has prioritized multifamily housing to accommodate the university\u2019s 22,000 students.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of condominium development,\u201d Krieger noted. \u201cThe town\u2019s construction has been a ton of apartments made to make more room for the college kids.\u201d\nStarkville\u2019s economy thrives on the university, the state\u2019s largest, which anchors a robust job market alongside growing healthcare and technology sectors. The downtown area, particularly University Avenue, balances youthful energy with sophisticated offerings.\n\u201cUniversity Avenue is a large stretch, which starts with a cotton district and ends up in a more adult section of downtown that has its own restaurants so you\u2019re able to separate from the college kids a little more,\u201d Krieger told the outlet. This mix fosters a lively yet navigable social scene.\nEducation is another draw, with local schools forging strong ties to the university.\n\u201cThey built a partnership with the middle school a few years back that\u2019s actually integrated with Mississippi State University, so that the kids have access to some of the professors there,\u201d Krieger said. \u201cAnd they have a plan to approve a high school to do the same thing that should come up later this year.\u201d\nThese collaborations enhance academic opportunities, making Starkville appealing to families.\nThe town\u2019s cultural and recreational offerings are equally compelling. History enthusiasts visit the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library, while the Starkville Community Theater and Starkville-MSU Symphony Orchestra enrich the arts scene.\nOutdoor activities abound, with the Starkville Wildlife Refuge offering hiking, hunting, and birdwatching.\nThe nearby Oktibbeha County Hospital provides advanced healthcare, a significant factor for the growing retiree population.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a college town with Mississippi State University here. It\u2019s vibrant. The kids keep us busy over here, but there\u2019s also a large retirement population coming in from both alumni and other parts of the state,\u201d Krieger observed.\nStarkville\u2019s community spirit peaks during Mississippi State\u2019s football season, when game days unite residents in tailgates and local bars.\n\u201cOf course there are times on SEC football weekends where it\u2019s a madhouse and there\u2019s traffic everywhere, but that\u2019s one of the unique features I like about it for such a small town of the South,\u201d Krieger said.\nYet, the town maintains a safe, approachable atmosphere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very welcoming. You feel safe. You walk the streets and it\u2019s not as much of a throw down college atmosphere as you might think,\u201d he added.\nStarkville\u2019s rise reflects a broader trend of small Southern towns gaining recognition for their quality of life.\nUSA Today also highlighted places like Lewisburg, West Virginia, and Williamsburg, Virginia, but Starkville\u2019s blend of economic opportunity, cultural depth and affordability sets it apart.\nIts evolution mirrors the vision of HGTV stars Ben and Erin Napier, who, in nearby Laurel, Mississippi, advocate for the potential of small-town living to rival urban centers.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "The state is at least 440,000 units short of demand for income-restricted affordable housing",
        "content": "It is no secret that Massachusetts has an affordable housing shortage. People of even modest means struggle to make rent here, and families are being rapidly priced out of the state. But how bad is the problem, really? According to one new report this week, the state only has enough affordable housing for 32 percent of the 652,000 low-income renter households who need it. In other words, 441,000 families in Massachusetts who qualify for affordable housing can\u2019t access it.The figure makes clear the bleak reality: the state\u2019s affordable housing system is no longer a reliable safety net. It is a rare commodity awarded only to a lucky few who, in some instances, quite literally hit the lottery. \u201cThe reality is that we need thousands and thousands more units of affordable housing for people of every income, every household size, in every place in Massachusetts,\u201d said Jessie Partridge Guerrero, director of data services at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which wrote the report with Housing Navigator Massachusetts, a nonprofit that created a statewide centralized affordable housing waitlist. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily shocking information, but the scale of that number certainly puts into perspective how far away we are from solving this problem.\u201dUnsurprisingly, the state\u2019s \u201caffordability gap,\u201d as researchers describe it, is the worst for the state\u2019s poorest residents. AdvertisementOf those 441,000 households who qualify for affordable housing but can\u2019t access it, some 44 percent are considered extremely low-income, meaning they make 30 percent of the area median income \u2014 in Greater Boston that\u2019s $48,950 for a family of four \u2014 or less. AdvertisementThose residents qualify for the government\u2019s deepest affordable housing subsidies such as public housing and Section 8 vouchers, both of which have waitlists that can stretch for over a decade. The Stone Mill Lofts in Lawrence, an old mill building converted into energy-efficient affordable housing.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe result is families who end up paying huge portions of their income toward rent, or endure overcrowded apartments, illegal or unsafe units, or in extreme cases, homelessness. For families who earn just a little more \u2014 \u201cvery low income\u201d households between 30 and 50 percent of the AMI \u2014 there are even fewer resources, the report found, because most state and federal programs target either the poorest residents or middle income earners, not anyone in between. Section 8 and public housing are designated for the state\u2019s poorest families, and the popular state affordable programs Chapter 40B and inclusionary zoning typically build units for people earning 80 percent of AMI.The people in between, 30 to 50 percent AMI earners, make too much money for public housing, and too little for inclusionary zoning units. The result is that 81 percent of those households do not live in affordable housing, the report found. \u201cWe call it the missing middle,\u201d said Jerome DuVal, executive director of Housing Navigator. \u201cWe have programs for people earning more than them, and programs for people earning much less. But in this push to build more, we\u2019ve missed some folks who need an affordable home.\u201dAnd while the state has a shortage of affordable units for families, the greatest need is for homes that can house \u201csmall households\u201d with one or two members. That, the reports\u2019 authors say, is at least a positive note, because those homes are smaller, cheaper, and easier to build. AdvertisementThe underlying problem is that the state has not built nearly enough affordable housing in recent decades. At the same time, the price of market-rate homes has soared, and \u201cnaturally occurring affordable housing\u201d like older triple-decker units that rented for cheap, have been flipped, upgraded, or simply had rents raised. Classic three-deckers and other small multi-family buildings, which have long provided a stock of relatively affordable rental housing in Eastern Massachusetts, have in recent years been increasingly converted to more expensive for-sale condos.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAnd income growth has not kept up with the pace of housing price growth, meaning more people than ever qualify for affordable housing. The aim of the report, said DuVal, is to encourage state policymakers to consider solutions to the state\u2019s deep housing shortage will stimulate building for people at all income levels. Simply building market-rate housing, while important, won\u2019t provide immediate relief for the people who need it the most. \u201cThe urgency to build a lot more housing is real,\u201d said DuVal. \u201cBut we want to make sure that its not just about more. It\u2019s also about ensuring we build the right kinds of housing for the right people in the right places.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

However, house hunters from\u00a0New York City\u00a0and\u00a0Washington, DC, are also taking notice.\nThe typical home in Toledo cost $235,000 in March, nearly $200,000 lower than the national price\u2014and that\u2019s after a 17.5% year-over-year price increase.\nGiven Toledo\u2019s robust demand and affordability, it\u2019s not surprising that homes there were flying off the shelves. In March, the typical residential property in Toledo was purchased within 37 days, or more than two weeks faster than the national median.\nPredictably, Toledo saw the sharpest increase in\u00a0home sales profit margins\u00a0so far this year, according to a new report fromATTOM Data Solutions, a curator of land, property data, and real estate analytics.\nAt the start of the new year, the median price of a home sold in Toledo was 44.7% more than the median purchase price for homes sold, up from 27.8% during the same period in 2024.\nThe resulting 16.9 percentage point gain was the largest in the country in the first quarter.\nToledo\u2019s other major draw, which it shares with other Midwestern metros, is a lower risk of climate-related disasters compared with coastal areas.\nA mere 1.5% of properties in Toledo are facing severe or extreme risk of one of the five risks considered\u2014extreme heat, wind, air quality, flood, and wildfire\u2014over the next 30 years.\nOverall, the top 20 markets in the latest ranking saw an average of just 4.7% of properties at risk of climate-related damage.\nToledo\u2019s economy primarily revolves around manufacturing, health care, and education. It also boasts a vibrant arts scene, anchored by the Toledo Museum of Art.

In March,\u00a0Youngstown, OH, emerged as the metro with the lowest median list price of $185,000\u2014a staggering $240,000 below the national price.\n\u201cThese low home prices mean that the minimum recommended income to purchase in one of these markets was an average $68,000, compared to the U.S. minimum recommendation of $98,000,\u201d says Hale.\nIn the March rankings,\u00a0New Haven, CT, ascended 34 spots since the past quarter, to No. 11, the biggest gain of any metro on the list.\nAlthough New Haven is higher-priced than the national market, with the typical home there costing $460,000 in March, it still offers buyers relative affordability within commuting distance of New York City, about 80 miles to the southwest.\nYoungston, OH, saw the second-biggest gain in rankings, jumping 16 places from the previous quarter to claim the No. 18 spot.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Trenton, NJ,\u00a0 suffered the most dramatic reversal in a span of three months.\nAfter climbing 16 spots to No. 12 during the winter, Trenton tumbled 12 places, crashing out of the top 20 and landing at No. 24 this quarter.\nColumbus, OH, experienced a similar fate, having lost 13 spots since the past quarter, to end up in No. 28 this time around.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nThis time of year fills me with such joy and anticipation. Seeing old friends emerge from the ground is almost as rewarding as knowing more are on their way. I am struck by how plants seem to grow inches overnight, especially after rain and the brief exposure to warmer weather earlier in the week.\n\nThe verdancy now apparent on the ground is complemented by the songs of spring peepers, tree frogs, and songbirds. So many forms of life are awakening after the long winter, including pollinators and butterflies. Despite the squeals of my children, the bumblebee we spotted in our garden this past weekend was no threat to them, merely a hungry queen looking to build up strength by visiting spring bulbs and flowers. She will soon seek out a nesting cavity to begin laying the eggs of a future colony. I recall being surprised when I learned that only about 5 percent of our native bees are social insects; the majority are solitary creatures, unlike the honeybee, which lives in large colonies.\n\nI am thinking about pollinators in my garden for several reasons. My basement is full of young vegetable plants, annual cut flowers, and perennials, and trends for pollinator health in our region are not good.Recent reports about honeybeesis alarming; all the more reason to find ways to support what pollinators remain.\n\nPollinators continue to face threats through habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change. Beyond honeybees, there are several things we \u2014 as gardeners \u2014 can do to promote and encourage pollinators to live in our gardens.\n\nAs we become more environmentally conscious, there is ever more awareness of how other forms of life interact with the spaces we create. Reader Ann Dorfman has an insightful question about striking a balance between having a formal garden space that can be shared with native bees.\n\nQ.Help! Yesterday I was scuffing up old bark mulch in a large formal garden bed when I noticed a number of bees flying around close to the ground. On closer examination, I realized they were cellophane bees. I think I had just scuffed over their nest holes! Then I noticed a number of bee nest holes in the area where I had not scuffed. Sadly, based on the number of bees flying over the scuffed bark mulch, I think I had already scuffed over a number of nest holes.\n\nMy question: This is a formal garden. Can I mulch over the nest holes? If not now, when?\n\nIn the future, where can someone like me goes to find an answer to a question like this about supporting our native insects in a timely fashion? Is there a place you recommend I can go to for help?\n\nAnn Dorfman\n\nA.First, I wish to applaud Ann for her keen observations and recognizing what those tiny holes in the mulch represent. For more information, Nick Dorian at theTufts Pollinator Initiativehas written a greatarticleabout cellophane bees and their life cycle. There is lots of other great info on local bees, pollinator initiatives, and related resources on theTufts website. We can really deepen our understanding of the natural world and cultivate a sense of awe when we slow down to look closely at our gardens. You need not sacrifice formality in a garden for creating habitat. Mulch can be applied carefully to minimize covering the nest holes. These bees dig holes that are 1 to 2 feet in depth, and they will be able to push through a light covering of mulch, just not inches thick. Bare earth is needed for ground-nesting pollinators, but not always desirable at the front of a formal bed.\n\nCreate alternate patches of bare earth in less prominent places. If you have space between plantings that will grow together over the season, consider leaving some bare patches of earth there. Other maintenance approaches to foster pollinator activity include cutting the stems of last year\u2019s perennials to 18 inches or longer, either leaving them standing or laying them down, a practice that encourages cavity-nesting pollinators.\n\nLeaf litter is another important habitat for pollinators like queen bumblebees and caterpillar cocoons. Try to leave areas in the garden where the leaves can stay undisturbed. Brush piles can be habitat, too, but they need not look messy. With intention, woody brush can be stacked into squares, circles, or curved shapes, thereby making them pleasing to our eyes. Contained within is excellent habitat for many creatures, including themourning cloak butterfly, who overwinter as adults and are among the earliest butterflies to emerge.\n\nTogether, we can each make a positive difference in our gardens with a combination of smart plant choices that support the broadest range of pollinators and maintenance practices that afford respect and space so that we can coexist with these incredible creatures. Spring is a time of hope, of rebirth, and new beginnings. Let this season be the one where we make forward-thinking decisions in our gardens for future generations.\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

        "content": "Hudson Yards has solidified its position as New York City\u2019s most expensive neighborhood for the \u2014 not first, not second, not third \u2014 butsixth year running, with a median sale price of $5.36 million in the first quarter of 2025, according to a newPropertyShark report.\nDespite a $645,000 year-over-year price drop, the Far West Side enclave outpaced all competitors, driven by high-end condominium sales and a surge in transactional activity.\nThe report, which analyzed sales of condos, co-ops and single-family homes across the city, highlights a robust start to the year for the city\u2019s luxury real estate market.\nThe citywide median sale price climbed 10% from last year to $1.15 million. Among the city\u2019s 50 priciest neighborhoods, 41 boasted median sale prices above $1 million \u2014 10 more than in Q1 2024 \u2014 with five Manhattan locales exceeding $2.5 million.\n\u201cHudson Yards has been consistently at the top of rankings since mid-2019,\u201d said Eliza Theiss, the report\u2019s author, in an interview with The Post. Around that time in 2019 is when the Hudson Yards megadevelopment \u2014 which also includes shopping, dining and a theater \u2014 made its highly anticipated debut.\n\u201cSince Hudson Yards residential developments started selling, the neighborhood has entrenched itself as the [No. 1] most expensive neighborhood because of the high-end stock that dominates this submarket of Manhattan.\u201d\nThe neighborhood\u2019s dominance is underscored by its sales figures: six of the 13 transactions in Q1 2025 exceeded $6 million, including two eight-figure deals at 35 Hudson Yards, where an 8,901-square-foot unit sold for $13.99 million and an 8,601-square-foot unit fetched $12.5 million.\n\u201cThe next \u2018cheapest\u2019 two sales were a 2,249-square-foot unit that went for $4.99 million and a 2,749-square-foot unit that sold for $4.99 million,\u201d Theiss noted. Ten of the 13 deals were inked at 35 Hudson Yards, with the remaining three at 15 Hudson Yards.\nEven the lowest-priced sale \u2014 a 1,907-square-foot condo \u2014 commanded $4.1 million.\nHudson Yards also saw a 160% year-over-year surge in sales, though this translated to just eight additional transactions.\n\u201cLooking ahead, Hudson Yards will likely continue to dominate NYC rankings as it has over the past nearly six years,\u201d Theiss said. She noted that the neighborhood only slipped from the top spot in quarters with fewer than five sales, such as Q3 2024, when Soho claimed first place, or Q2 2020, when Tribeca took the lead.\nManhattan dominated the top 10 priciest neighborhoods, securing six spots.\nLittle Italy, absent from recent rankings due to low sales volume, roared back to second place with a $4.59 million median, driven by high-end Nolita condo sales, including an $8 million unit at The Residences at Prince. Soho ($3.85 million) and Tribeca ($3.3 million) followed, while the Soho sub-district Hudson Square ($2.6 million) rounded out the top five after a 61% price jump. The Theatre District-Times Square area ($1.67 million) closed the top 10.\nBrooklyn, however, edged out Manhattan overall, placing 22 neighborhoods in the top 50 compared to Manhattan\u2019s 20.\n\u201cBrooklyn edging Manhattan out is a fairly recent and still sporadic development of the NYC market,\u201d Theiss added. \u201cWhile 15 years ago Brooklyn outpacing Manhattan seemed still far-fetched, Brooklyn\u2019s presence in the top 50 has been increasing steadily.\u201d\nShe attributed this to Manhattan\u2019s soaring prices pushing buyers to Brooklyn, fueling demand for high-end properties. Cobble Hill led Brooklyn at $1.91 million, followed by Dumbo ($1.88 million) and Boerum Hill ($1.7 million).\nQueens trailed with 11 neighborhoods in the top 50, led by Malba at $1.6 million \u2014 just $115,000 shy of the top 10.\n\u201cQueens always falls behind because it doesn\u2019t have the pricing levels of the other two boroughs,\u201d Theiss said.\n\u201cBuyers priced out of Manhattan have tended to choose Brooklyn as their next market as opposed to Queens, due to a number of factors, including its more convenient proximity to Manhattan.\u201d\nStill, Queens has shown steady growth, with neighborhoods like Auburndale \u2014 which is close to Nassau County \u2014 rising from a $719,500 median in 2016 to $960,000 in 2024.\nSome traditional heavyweights stumbled.\nCarroll Gardens, Brooklyn\u2019s former No. 4, saw its median sale price plummet from $2.79 million to $1.38 million, driven by smaller homes averaging 1,035 square feet. The Flatiron District and Chelsea also fell, landing at No. 19 with $1.38 million medians after 30% price drops tied to a shift toward co-ops and smaller units.\nAs the city\u2019s luxury market heats up, Hudson Yards\u2019 enduring reign signals Manhattan\u2019s grip on the ultra-high-end, even as Brooklyn gains ground.\n\u201cManhattan still remains the dominant power,\u201d Theiss emphasized, citing its concentration of top-tier neighborhoods and significant price gaps with Brooklyn\u2019s priciest areas.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "New Yorkers will soon have a new pool to splash around in come summer \u2014 and, in the winter, a new rink for ice skating. There\u2019s even fun in store for the in-between seasons.\nThat\u2019s because the northern edge of Central Park, long bypassed by visitors drawn to the green space\u2019s southern landmarks, is poised to become a vibrant destination with the April 26 opening of the $160 million Davis Center at the Harlem Meer.\u00a0The Central Park Conservancy calls this its biggest and most complex project since it was founded in 1980.\nAt its heart is the Gottesman Pool, a state-of-the-art aquatic facility set to rank as the city\u2019s eighth-largest, designed to serve thousands of swimmers and foster community connection in a historically underserved corner of the park.\nThe Davis Center, a public-private collaboration led by the conservancy with $60 million from the city and $100 million in private donations, replaces the aging Lasker Rink and Pool, a 1960s structure that had fallen into disrepair.\nDesigned by Susan T. Rodriguez and Mitchell Giurgola Architects, the facility nestles into the park\u2019s rugged terrain, its low-profile pavilion crowned by a sod roof that doubles as a scenic overlook.\nThe pool, opening for public swimming in late June, can accommodate up to 1,000 swimmers at a time, offering a cool respite during those sweltering city summers.\nIn winter, it transforms into an ice rink \u2014 and in spring and fall, it becomes the Harlem Oval, an artificial turf field for community activities.\nHow it works: There\u2019s a riser system placed underneath the rink in the winter and the lawn in warmer months \u2014 to support their own bases. It\u2019s then removed for revelers to make a splash in the pool all summer long.\n\u201cThe opening of the Davis Center in Central Park is a shining example of what makes New York City more livable and the best place to raise a family,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said in a press release.\nThe pool and surrounding facility restore a landscape altered by decades of urban interventions. Unlike the Lasker Pool, which disrupted the natural flow of water into the Harlem Meer, the Davis Center reconnects a stream through the historic Huddlestone Arch, creating a wetland edge that enhances the area\u2019s ecological integrity.\u00a0Not to mention something scenic for visitors to take in.\nA new shoreline boardwalk, accessible to all, winds along the Meer, inviting pedestrians to explore the park\u2019s northeastern corner, a 20-minute bike ride from Midtown.\n\u201cToday is a joyful and deeply meaningful day for Central Park and for New York City,\u201d said Betsy Smith, President and CEO of the Central Park Conservancy. \u201cWhat once was a beloved but aging facility is now a beautiful, welcoming place that celebrates Central Park and welcomes New Yorkers to swim, skate, learn and connect \u2014 all year round.\u201d\nThe facility\u2019s design prioritizes community needs, informed by years of dialogue with Harlem and East Harlem residents.\nThe pavilion, with its Corinthian granite walls and expansive glass doors, serves as a light-filled hub for gatherings \u2014 housing changing rooms, restrooms and a compact caf\u00e9.\nIts sustainable features, targeting LEED Gold certification, include a green roof planted with native species and a skylight that bathes the interior in natural light.\nPhilanthropic contributions included $40 million from Kathryn and Andrew Davis, for whom the center is named, and a significant gift from David S. Gottesman and Ruth L. Gottesman, for whom the pool is named.\n\u201cKate and I are honored to support the Davis Center at the Harlem Meer, a project that restores a vital part of Central Park and reconnects it with the Harlem community,\u201d said the Davises in the press release.\nAlice Gottesman added, \u201cSwimming and skating outdoors in Central Park are special, unmatched experiences. The new Davis Center at the Harlem Meer will make these opportunities accessible to so many more New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe pool\u2019s programming, operated by the city Parks department, includes free Learn to Swim lessons and aquatic activities from late June to early September, addressing the needs of a community where access to such resources has been limited.\nYear-round offerings, supported by donors like JPMorganChase and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, feature fitness classes, art workshops, and ecological tours, with a focus on engaging local youth.\n\u201cThe historic Harlem Meer is one of Central Park\u2019s greatest gems, so I\u2019m thrilled that the new Davis Center\u2019s programming and facilities will offer endless ways for visitors to connect with the Meer,\u201d said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, whose office provided $2.2 million for the project.\nThe Davis Center\u2019s completion marks the culmination of a decades-long effort to revitalize Central Park\u2019s northern end, where the Conservancy has invested more than $310 million since the 1980s.\nOn April 26, at noon, a community celebration on the Harlem Oval will launch the center\u2019s public debut, featuring local performances, food and hourly tours.\nAdvertisement",

The co-op\u2019s three private terrace views look out over the Met, Central Park and the Manhattan skyline.\nTate Kelly and Josue Gonzalez of Coldwell Banker Warburg hold the listing. The penthouse measures around 3,000 square feet, according to Kelly, with another 311 square feet of terrace space.\nThe listing advertises three to five bedrooms, depending on the preferences of the buyer, and 3.5 bathrooms. The large corner living room boasts a floor-to-ceiling corner window with western and southern skyline views, and access to one of the three terraces.\nThe primary suite has its own terrace overlooking the Met.\nA hidden hall closet adds extra character to the home \u2014 the door is blended in between the entry gallery and the formal dining room.\n\u201cNo one notices it when they walk by,\u201d Kelly told The Post. \u201cAnd even if they do, they don\u2019t realize that it is also a secret passageway to one of the bedrooms.\u201d\nThe multiple uses of the rooms reflect the many lives lived in this multi-generational home. One room, Kelly said, has been variously used as a maid\u2019s room, a nanny\u2019s room, a play room and an artist studio.\nKelly said the current owners bought the unit directly from the developer of 1050 Fifth Ave., Bernard Spitzer. Spitzer, a real estate developer and the father of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, built the luxury co-op with business partner Melvin D. Lipman.\nKelly said the family raised their children there, but have less need for the unit as the family has gotten older.\n\u201cIt was a true family home, and now that all the children are grown and have moved out of town, the sellers no longer have a use for it,\u201d Kelly said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "States in the South andMidwestlead the nation in\u00a0homebuilding\u00a0and affordability, according to a newnational housing report cardgrading each state\u2019s response to the housing crisis.\nSouth Carolina tops the rankings as the only state to receive a grade of A in the new report card released on Thursday by the\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0economic research team.\nOf the 13 A and B grades handed out, all were to states in the South or Midwest. Meanwhile, the seven F grades on the report card all went to states in the West and Northeast, whereprices are usually higherand\u00a0zoning and land use regulations\u00a0are generally stricter.\nHowever, no state in the nation scored an A+ in the new rankings, showing that there is room for improvement in every state when it comes to addressing the nation\u2019s\u00a0housing supply gap\u00a0of nearly 4 million units.\n\u201cOur state report card rankings reveal stark disparities in housing affordability andhomebuilding effortsacross the U.S.,\u201d says Realtor.com Chief Economist\u00a0Danielle Hale. \u201cWhile some states are leading the way with strong homebuilding activity, others are grappling with high housing prices and sluggish construction.\u201d\nThe rankings for each state are equally based on two major factors: housing affordability and the ability to meet future supply challenges through new construction.\nAffordability, one half of the score, includes the\u00a0Realtors\u00ae Affordability Score\u00a0and the share of median income it takes to make payments on a median-priced home.\nHomebuilding activity, the other half of the score, is based on building permits per capita and the\u00a0new-construction premium, which is the cost difference between new and existing homes.\nIn this last regard, South Carolina excels, with the typical new home in the Palmetto State priced 8.2% lower than the typical existing home. By comparison, nationwide, the median sales price for new homes was 3.4% higher than for existing homes last year.\nIt means that South Carolina is beating the rest of the nation in constructing homes at affordable price ranges.\nSouth Carolina is also outperforming in raw construction activity, with 3.2% of the nation\u2019s building permits last year, despite hosting only 1.6% of the country\u2019s population.\nAs for its current home affordability situation, South Carolina is in the middle of the pack, ranked No. 24 on its affordability score, with the typical home price about 5.5 times higher than median annual salary.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nThe two states that received A- grades performed well for different reasons: Texas for its success in homebuilding, and Iowa for its current affordability.\nToday, Texas homes are slightly less affordable than the national average, relative to local incomes. But the Lone Star State is making a major residential construction push to meet demand and\u00a0ensure adequate housing supply for the future.\nTexas accounted for 15.3% of the national residential construction permits last year, although it is home to just 9.2% of the population. That gap of 6.1 percentage points was the largest of any state, showing how Texas is punching above its weight when it comes to homebuilding.\nStill, the median new-construction home in Texas costs 7.5% more than the typical existing home, showing that there is still room for the state\u2019s builders to improve their focus on building smaller, more affordable homes.\nIowa, on the other hand, slightly underperforms in permit activity, with marginally fewer permits than its share of population would indicate.\nNew homes in Iowa also cost a whopping 58% more than existing homes, suggesting that homebuilders in the state are focused on constructing larger, more expensive homes, potentially neglecting the needs of first-time buyers.\nHowever, overall, Iowa is among the most affordable states in the nation for homebuyers, thanks to its strong wages and low home prices.\nThe median list price in Iowa of $294,600 is just 4.03 times the local median salary of $73,122, the lowest ratio among the states.\nA total of seven states received the lowest grade of F on the new report card: Oregon, Connecticut, California, Hawaii, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.\nGenerally speaking, these are states that combine poor home affordability with inadequate residential construction activity to keep up with demand.\nBased on numerical score, Rhode Island ranks lowest on the report card. As the smallest state, Rhode Island might suffer from a lack of available land to build on\u2014although the second-smallest state, Delaware, ranked above average with a C+.\nCalifornia, a state notorious for its unaffordable housing, is the worst in the nation for its permits-to-population ratio. Last year, California accounted for 6.8% of all residential permits, despite having 11.7% of the total population.\nHomebuilders in California blame excessive\u00a0regulations\u00a0and land use restrictions, which they say raise construction costs and deter new construction.\n\u201cIf California is serious about solving its housing crisis, we need a legal and regulatory system that supports\u2014not stifles\u2014homebuilding,\u201d says\u00a0Dan Dunmoyer, president and CEO of theCalifornia Building Industry Association. \u201cThat means [environmental regulation] reform, streamlined permitting, and more flexible land-use policies.\u201d\nThe CBIA has called on state lawmakers to reform the California Environmental Quality Act, saying that it is often abused to block or delay new housing projects. The group also advocates for streamlined permitting and reforms to \u201coutdated and restrictive\u201d permitting laws.\nLikewise, New York is in dire need of regulatory reforms to encourage more homebuilding, says\u00a0Michael Fazio, executive director of theNew York State Builders Association.\n\u201cWe need housing terribly. In this state, it\u2019s really at a crisis point, and everybody talks about it, but we need to be doing more to address it,\u201d he says. \u201cRed tape and regulations are a major impediment\u2014that\u2019s a major obstacle to building housing.\u201d\nAs well, Fazio says that New York\u2019s recent move to impose the highest level of wetland protections on 1 million acres of land will put a serious damper on new construction, as much of the newly protected land is adjacent to existing suburbs with utilities connections.\nIn Syracuse, for example, the new restrictions have increased protected acreage by 245%, with more than 144,000 acres contiguous to the urban area falling under protected status, according to a study commissioned by NYSBA.\nExcessive local zoning restrictions and lengthy permitting and review processes add to the pain for homebuilders in New York, says Fazio.\n\u201cBuilders are leaving because it\u2019s just so onerous,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up \u2026 going to North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, where regulations aren\u2019t as onerous as here.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Residents go to the ballot box Tuesday to vote on the biggest property tax override in town history",
        "content": "\u201cWhy is Milton so poor?\u201dIt\u2019s the question my 12-year-old son has been asking on and off for the past few months. Apparently our town\u2019s budget crisis is even obvious to a sixth grader. He asks because his teachers have been rationing paper because there\u2019s no money to buy more. He asks because one of his favorite teachers abruptly quit in February, and I wondered if looming school cuts pushed her to find another job \u2014 out of fear she might be laid off.As a parent, you don\u2019t want your kids to worry about money, and for the most part, my kids haven\u2019t had to \u2014 until now. The absurdity of it all is that Milton is not at all poor. Last year the median sale price of a single-family home in Milton was $1 million, and the median household income is nearly $180,000 a year. Yet Milton is facing a double whammy of money woes: Mid-year school budget cuts and the prospect of higher property taxes with residents heading to the polls  Tuesday to vote on a $9.5 million tax override aimed at avoiding deep reductions to education and other town services next year.Some of the school\u2019s fiscal problems have been self-inflicted \u2014 a legacy of flawed accounting practices that have now been addressed \u2014 but the upshot is that property taxes in Milton no longer cover our town\u2019s expenses, which have been growing because of sky-high inflation and other rising costs. Advertisement\u201cCommunities that seem in many ways to be affluent, their city or town government may not be correspondingly affluent,\u201d explained Adam Chapdelaine, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, an advocacy group for the state\u2019s 351 towns and cities.AdvertisementAnd so, for the second time in a decade, Milton town officials are asking residents to vote to override Proposition 2\u00bd, the 1980 state law that restricts how much a municipality can increase its property tax collection. Students board a school bus on Adams Street in East Milton for the morning ride to school in 2023. Milton Public Schools is now facing a projected budget deficit, and a tax override is needed to prevent deeper cuts and layoffs.Lane TurnerVoters in a state-wide ballot initiative approved Prop. 2\u00bd in a bid to rein in out-of-control municipal spending, but decades later the concept has failed to keep up with expenses of modern times. School budgets, in particular, have gotten bigger to accommodate the growing number of students with disabilities that require costly services, from specialized therapies to one-on-one aides. Add in high energy prices and soaring costs of health insurance for town employees, and tax revenue hasn\u2019t kept pace with the bills. Milton\u2019s hardly the only Boston-area suburb facing this predicament. Other towns from Brookline to Acton have faced similar financial challenges and have had to go to the ballot box in recent years to resolve budget shortfalls. Related: Mass. communities increasingly seek overrides to tax cap to pay for schools, other servicesDuring the pandemic years, federal money helped Milton and other towns put off raising taxes, but now those funds have run out. About 50 towns in Massachusetts held tax overrides last year, compared to an average of 24 override votes in the four years prior, according to an analysis by Chapdelaine. He expects this year to be historically high for overrides. So much so that he thinks it\u2019s time policymakers consider whether the current municipal tax structure is sustainable. \u201dProp. 2\u00bd is under more strain than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Chapdelaine. \u201cIt\u2019s likely time for a dialogue around Prop. 2\u00bd\u2019s efficacy as we try to maintain city and town services.\u201dAdvertisementI\u2019m not happy about paying higher taxes, but I\u2019ll be voting yes Tuesday because Milton schools really can\u2019t afford to lose more. This would be the biggest override request in town history. But if it doesn\u2019t pass, the school system that serves about 4,300 students would have to slash school spending by about $6.3 million, or nearly 10 percent of its budget. That could mean a loss of 76 positions, including dozens of teachers and specialists, and cuts to clubs and sports. Related: Milton town website: Homeowners can calculate override impact on their tax billSupporting the override means my own property tax bill is estimated to go up by about $1,250 to about $15,000. That\u2019ll hurt. But it\u2019s a worthy investment in a town I love and have called home for 15 years. This is what it means to be part of a community. You come together in times of need. Plus, I want to pay it forward. Both of my sons are on the autism spectrum, and when they were in preschool and kindergarten, they benefited from Milton\u2019s specialized educational services \u2014 support that helped them become the high-functioning kids they are today. In Medford, opponents of a tax override held Vote No Tax Overrides signs in 2024. The measures passed in November. Cheryl Senter/Cheryl Senter for The Boston GlobeMike Baker, a Milton resident who is an instructional aide at Pierce Middle School, will also be voting yes, but it still may not be enough to save his job. He\u2019s low on the seniority list at Milton\u2019s only middle school, and the override plugs future budget gaps, not the current one. He\u2019s voting yes to ensure that his son, who is a sixth grader at Pierce with my son, will get a good education. Our kids also know each other from playing on the town\u2019s travel basketball team the past three seasons.Advertisement\u201cWe live in one of the richer towns in the state of Massachusetts and to have to even do a vote at all is kind of disheartening,\u201d said Baker. Still, he calls the override a \u201cnecessity.\u201dDespite Milton\u2019s affluence, it doesn\u2019t have much of a commercial tax base, and that means residential property taxes are high. My tax bill is already close to double the state average of about $7,700. Gulp again. There\u2019s not a lot of new development to help absorb rising costs, either.Of course, we could fix that part, but as the first municipality where voters rejected a state-mandated zoning plan for more multifamily housing, Milton has become the poster child for anti-development sentiment. Milton remains at odds with the state housing law \u2014 even after losing in January a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Andrea Campbell that went all the way to the Supreme Judicial Court.Related: Milton residents voted down a plan for more housing.

Elizabeth Carroll, chair of the Milton School Committee, said she feels \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d One indication: Drive around town, and you only see \u201cVote Yes! For the Override\u201d lawn signs. Supporters have been out in force, knocking on doors and even hosting an information session at a recent bingo lunch at the senior center.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a visible \u2018no\u2019 campaign,\u201d said Carroll. \u201cOther towns you see no signs. That makes me optimistic.\u201dLet\u2019s hope the signs have it right \u2014 and that Milton chooses to invest in its kids and its future.AdvertisementSigns supporting a tax override are displayed in yards on Central Avenue in Milton.

        "content": "Picture this: a grand neo-Tudor residence in Brooklyn\u2019s Ditmas Park, built for the silent film siren Mary Pickford \u2014 the \u201cQueen of Movies\u201d \u2014 who never even unpacked her bags.\nNow, this storied slice of Hollywood history at 1320 Ditmas Ave. is up for grabs at $2.99 million, beckoning buyers with its vintage swagger and a whisper of Tinseltown glamour, The Post has learned.\nListed by Corcoran\u2019s Karen Talbott, Kyle Talbott and Scott Sternberg, the 5,000-square-foot home is a love letter to Victorian Flatbush, blending old-school charm with modern pizzazz.\nThe six-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom residence, built in 1910 by Vitagraph Film Studios, was meant to house Pickford, dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart\u201d for her ing\u00e9nue roles and unrivaled fame, according to theBrooklyn Daily Eagle.\n\u201cThe seller believes, based on her research, that this home was originally built for Mary as part of a contract negotiation. However, she ultimately decided to move to California instead,\u201d Karen Talbott told The Post.\nThough she never moved in, neighborhood locals and film buffs still call it \u201cMary Pickford\u2019s house.\u201d\nA co-founder of United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks (who became her second husband) and D.W. Griffith in 1919, Pickford redefined stardom and studio power.\n\u201cThis is actually one case in which it\u2019s very easy to say something that is pretty much inarguable, which is that she was the first female movie star,\u201d Michael Cramer, a film history professor at Sarah Lawrence College, told The Post. \u201cShe\u2019s the most famous woman, the most famous movie star in the world in the 1910s.\u201d\nPickford died at the age of 87 in 1979. Despite the grandeur of her earlier years, she became a recluse in her later ones at Pickfair, the California estate she built with Fairbanks \u2014 staying there with her third husband.\nStill, like her career, this Brooklyn home dazzles in its own right.\nA sweeping foyer flows into a sprawling living room and an octagonal dining room, both boasting working fireplaces. Sunlight dances on original woodwork, leaded glass built-ins and hardwood floors.\n\u201cThis property exudes the grandeur of Hollywood homes, featuring exceptionally high ceilings and basement ceilings, which were designed to accommodate [Fairbanks], who was very tall,\u201d Talbott said. \u201cThe craftsmanship throughout the home reflects a sense of elegance and grace, clearly intended for someone very special.\u201d\nUpstairs, a plush landing connects to four bedrooms, three baths and two home offices with treetop views.\nThe basement boasts an entertainment room with a wood-paneled bar, another fireplace, a mirrored gym, laundry, wine storage and a workshop.\nIt was all built in a grand sense for a presence to match.\n\u201cI would definitely say without a doubt, Mary Pickford was the most powerful and influential woman ever in Hollywood history. And I would stand by that,\u201d Elaina Friedrichsen, Director of Archive & Legacy at the Mary Pickford Foundation, and Head of Production at the Mary Pickford Company, told The Post.\n\u201cShe created her own studio. She was one of the founding members of the Motion Picture, now today known as the Motion Pictures Television Fund. She broke ground at the Motion picture home in 1941. She also was one of the Founding Members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.\u201d\nThe Vitagraph connection, however, is fuzzy.\nFriedrichsen noted, \u201cAlthough Mary never worked for Vitagraph Studios, she was with Biograph Studios from 1909 through 1912 with a brief stint traveling with the IMP Studios and then Majestic in Chicago in 1911.\u201d\nPickford later joined Famous Players, which became Paramount Pictures, before launching United Artists. Vitagraph, a Midwood-based studio later absorbed by Warner Brothers, built the home as Ditmas Park bloomed, alongside an apartment building for stars like Pickford, Fairbanks and Fatty Arbuckle.\nContract talks with Vitagraph fizzled in 1916, and Pickford rejoined Adolph Zukor\u2019s Famous Players, per Richard Alleman\u2019s \u201cNew York: The Movie Lover\u2019s Guide.\u201d\nPickford also defined what it meant to be a self-made woman.\n\u201cWhile she loved to invest in real estate for financial reasons, some of her homes were havens for her to escape from it all,\u201d Friedrichsen said. \u201cShe was the first woman to earn a million dollars in a year in this country. And was earning the equivalent today of two million dollars a year by 2017.\u201d\nCramer added, \u201cSometimes you will see her be defined as the first millionaire in Hollywood. I suspect she\u2019s the first millionaire performer.\u201d\nBorn in Toronto to modest roots, Pickford\u2019s rise was meteoric.\n\u201cFrom a very, very early age, she was supporting her family on the stage and had a magical quality about her that was unmatched,\u201d Friedrichsen said.\nBy her teens, she was a sensation. \u201cShe played any kind of roles and was absolutely incredibly enchanting on the screen from day one. So her fame caught on pretty quickly by 1914, I think she was 13, 14,\u201d Friedrichsen said.\n\u201cThe other thing that\u2019s really important is not only is she important as an actress, she is also really important as a producer,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cOnce she becomes famous, she starts production companies to make her own films, which means that she\u2019s in charge of everything: hiring the director, the screenwriter, which films to make.\u201d\nUnited Artists gave independent producers like her unprecedented control, fueling her fortune.\n\u201cShe was \u2018America\u2019s sweetheart\u2019 and stood for a notion of homespun delicacy. But she was also in the news for her financial success, her salary going astronomical in just a few years,\u201d said Dana Polan, Martin Scorsese Professor of Cinema Studies at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Rock legend Gene Simmons, the fire-breathing bassist of Kiss, is parting ways with his striking Beverly Hills residence, listing the modern masterpiece for $13.99 million. But the 75-year-old musician isn\u2019t handing the keys to just anyone.\n\u201cYou have such wonderful times there, you don\u2019t want some schmuck in the place you call home,\u201d Simmons told theWall Street Journal,which first reported on the listing. \u201cNo drugs, no alcoholics. I don\u2019t want anybody coming in there who is going to destroy the place.\u201d\nPerched on a hillside with sweeping vistas of Coldwater Canyon, Century City and the Pacific Ocean, the 7,741-square-foot, four-bedroom home is a showcase of Swiss architectural precision.\nDesigned by Roger P. Kurath of Design21, the residence blends glass, steel, oak and concrete into a sleek, energy-efficient structure inspired by LEED principles.\nIts fiber cement exterior panels promise over 50 years of maintenance-free durability, while triple-panel windows ensure fire resistance and waterproofing, the listing notes.\nThis being Southern California, there are also some real outdoor perks.\n\u201cThe 40-foot glasslike infinity pool is a real showstopper, surrounded by lush, drought-tolerant landscaping, and the bold bronze geometric sculptures add a cool, artistic vibe to the outdoor space,\u201d Lisa Young, the Compass listing agent handling the sale alongside colleagues Kennon Earl and Thomas Davila, told The Post in a statement.\nSimmons and his wife, Shannon Tweed Simmons, acquired the property in 2021 for $10.5 million afterbriefly relocating to Las Vegas.\nThe couple, who own multiple properties including two Malibu homes, a residence in Canada \u2014 plus homes for their children, Nick and Sophie \u2014 found Vegas\u2019 heat unbearable and made the Beverly Hills house their primary residence.\nNow they\u2019re streamlining their portfolio and plan to spend more time in a recently purchased Malibu property.\n\u201cI\u2019m the most blessed human being on the planet,\u201d Simmons told the Journal. \u201cThese hard times, you don\u2019t want to say I have too many houses, but we have too many properties.\u201d\nThe home\u2019s design emphasizes indoor-outdoor living, with floor-to-ceiling windows that slide open to a 1,800-square-foot deck. That solar-powered, 40-foot black-lined infinity pool anchors the half-acre lot.\nInside, 12-foot ceilings and an open floor plan create a sense of spaciousness, while amenities include radiant heated flooring and high-end smart-home systems.\n\u201cIt is like a 22nd-century house,\u201d Simmons said, noting the complexity of the voice-activated appliances.\n\u201cI had to go out and buy a simple microwave so that I could press one button and heat things up because the coffee maker, the cappuccino maker, the time machine, all that stuff was built into the wall \u2014 voice activated I might add \u2014 was so complex, I couldn\u2019t make it work.\u201d\nSimmons, known for his theatrical stage persona as \u201cThe Demon,\u201d has infused the home with personal touches.\nAn upstairs gallery displays his artwork, and a soundproofed theater hosts screenings for his production company, Simmons/Hamilton Productions, which released the 2022 film \u201cDeep Water.\u201d\nOutdoors, Simmons enjoys barbecuing and playing \u201cCards Against Humanity\u201d with his children and their partners.\n\u201cOf course, we laugh our heads off,\u201d he told the outlet.\nThe home\u2019s location was a draw for its proximity to movie studios, business partners and family.\n\u201cFamily is forever,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cYou want someplace that can be your business center, close to everything that you need in LA, but also a place where your kids want to come over and hang with you.\u201d\nSimmons\u2019 favorite moments in the home revolve around its views.\n\u201cMy favorite part of the house is waking up in the morning in the upper bedroom, having coffee in bed and on a clear day being able to see all the way out to the ocean,\u201d he told The Post in a statement. \u201cAnd my other favorite time is sunset in the upper bedroom or downstairs barbecuing something outdoors. The views really are spectacular.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles luxury real estate market has cooled recently, with economic uncertainty tempering demand.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, luxury single-family homes sold for an average of $15.92 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, but sales have since slowed, particularly in the valley, according to Young.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing much change in interest rates while new listings are picking up which might give buyers more options to explore the market,\u201d she said. \u201cThis incredible listing is a great opportunity for a luxury property owner displaced by fires not wanting to return or a discerning buyer looking for a quality architectural investment.\u201d\nFor Simmons, the sale marks a new chapter as he and his wife prioritize time at their other properties.\n\u201cWherever wifey wants, certainly,\u201d he told the Journal. \u201cCertainly, happy wife, happy life.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "An imperious mansion located in a Houston subdivision \u2014 and, no, not in a galaxy far, far away \u2014 sold earlier this month for $3.4 million.\nThe property is known as the Darth Vader house. The unique home, built by a surgeon in the \u201990s to resemble a Lockheed Nighthawk stealth fighter, received the moniker for its imposing, helmet-like facade \u2014 which give it a quirky \u201cStar Wars\u201d vibe.\nAfter several changed hands and a few years on the market, the home has found a new owner in Mexican artist and photographerEnrique Cabrera, theHouston Chronicle reported, and he plans to rebrand the dwelling.\nThe 7,040-square-foot residence is located in Houston\u2019s West University subdivision. Its angular dark slate and aluminum exteriors are unmistakable, and earned it a spot on the popular Instagram account Zillow Gone Wild.\nThe viral property was built in 1992 for Houston plastic surgeon Dr. Jean Cuckier. Architect Randy Hickey toldTexas Monthlythat Cuckier was inspired by a stealth fighter jet.\nThe interiors are just as striking as the facade.\nLaser-blue backlighting illuminates the living area, which features a sunken conversation put and two floating glass staircases.\nThe angular black and white floors, made of concrete and hand-cut black stone, run throughout the home\u2019s four bedrooms and five bathrooms. The home also boasts a four-car garage and a hot tub.\nThe eye-catching mansion hit the market in2021 for $4.3 million. It wassold the same yearto real estate agent Jason Junkin of Nitya Realty.\n\u201cI lived in Houston most of my life, and I had always seen the house, and it was just kind of an emotional buy I guess,\u201d Junkin told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cIf the house next door was for sale, I wouldn\u2019t have even batted an eye at it.\nJunkin sought to sell the home with another brokerage before he reestablished himself as its listing agent. It most recently advertised for $3.35 million.\nA blog post by Nan and Co. Properties, whose agent Hardy Pollard represented Cabrera, confirmed the purchase of the home for $3.4 million.\nThe angular nature of the house appears to compliment the artist\u2019s style.\nCabrera may be locally known to New Yorkers as the sculptor behind \u201cLa Gran Manzana,\u201d a large, angular red apple near Rockefeller Center and \u201cEl Toro de Oro,\u201d a large, angular golden bull in the Meatpacking District.\nCabrera plans to use the home as a private residence, according to the Houston Chronicle, and to install one of his bull sculptures on the property. He\u2019s also changing the name.\nCabrera told the publication that he is renaming the property \u201cThe Black Bull House.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The micro-unit trend has flown out east.\nA 330-square-foot studio-loft just hit the market in Hampton Bays for $259,000. The listing, located at 90 Springville Road \u2014 and one of the smallest now for sale on the East End, according to OutEast \u2014 is held by Isis Rayne and Kim Parshley of Compass.\nThis teeny slice of the Hamptons \u2014 which has long been synonymous for wealth, power and mansions \u2014 advertises an open-concept layout and a sleeping loft accessed by a ladder.\nThe home is a part of the Springville Estates, a decades-old 30-unit cooperative that formerly operated as a tennis camp.\n\u201cThe Co-Op board is really passionate about keeping the community small and tight knit,\u201d Rayne told The Post.\nRayne said the unit has drawn inquiries from plenty of residents in Florida and Georgia looking for a northern summer home.\nThe unit on Springville Road is not the smallest home in the Hamptons \u2014 a 216-square-foot room in Montauk takes that cake \u2014\u00a0but it is certainly one of the best-appointed.\nThe unit was recently updated, Rayne said, with new cabinetry, countertops, bathroom tiles and a shower. The fresh renovation makes the unit a standout among similarly priced pads.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else like it on the market at that price point,\u201d Rayne said.\nRayne told The Post that the lofted area can be used for storage or as a bedroom, but the ceiling height means that this space is kneeling room only. Built-in storage is limited to kitchen cabinets and some living room shelves.\nThe studio boasts a private wooden deck spanning 200 square feet, which offers a little bit of privacy and a whole lot of breathing room.\nCo-op residents also enjoy access to a shared pool, a tennis court and a laundry room.\nWhat the home lacks in space, it makes up for in conveniences. It\u2019s a short drive to the beach across the Ponquogue Bridge, and an even shorter drive to a boat and kayak launch on nearby Tiana Bay. Downtown Hampton Bays and the local train station are also minutes away.\nTiny living is a unique way of life in the enclave synonymous with outsized wealth. Million-dollar listings inMontauk Shores, a trailer park on the far eastern tip of Long Island,regularly grab headlines.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The massive edifice at 25 Water St. has successfully swapped its cubicles for more than 1,000 apartments.\nThe former Financial District office tower underwent a two-year gut renovation to turn it into a high-end residential apartment complex. The behemoth of a property was once shared by JPMorgan Chase, the National Enquirer and the New York Daily News.\nWhen the 32-story tower opened up leasing in January, it becamethe largest office-to-residential conversionin US history.\nThe overhaul is just the tip of the iceberg of office-to-residential conversions in New York City, thanks to ambitious developers and new regulations.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t compete as office buildings anymore,\u201d Nathan Berman, the founder of developer Metro Loft,told the New York Times. \u201cAnd we\u2019re taking them, sort of, out of the race.\u201d\nThis newly debuted building, called SoMA (South Manhattan), contains 1,320 units ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. Rents range from $4,000 for a studio to more than $10,000 for a three-bedroom, according to StreetEasy.\nTwo four-bedroom units on higher floors start leasing this summer, the Times reported, and 25% of the building\u2019s units have been set aside as affordable.\nNot long ago, 25 Water St. was derided by its office tenants as fortress-like. The 55-year-old brutalist structure was originally built to house computers, hence the former facade\u2019s striking lack of windows. The sparse, thin exposures were designed to keep mid-century behemoth computers cold.\nNow, SoMA is an amenity-packed oasis for young professionals, the first of whom moved in February. Residents enjoy luxurious amenities like an infrared dry sauna, a salt room,\u00a0pickleball courts, two pools and a two-lane bowling alley.\nDevelopers Metro Loft, Rockwood Capital and GFP Real Estate were behind the conversion. They purchased the nearly vacant property in 2022 after occupancy plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The developers undertook an ambitious renovation, which included replacing the facade\u2019s all-encompassing brickwork with large windows, carving out light wells and adding 10 stories.\nDevelopers and architects will attest to the fact that office conversions are particularly tricky \u2014 windows, central air conditioning and bathrooms often need total overhauling. Building and fire codes for residential buildings are also different from office buildings.\nThe Adams administration\u2019s \u201cCity of Yes\u201d plan has made office-to-residential conversions significantly easier,the Post previously reported, making it more than likely that similar developments to 25 Water St. are on the horizon.\nIt\u2019s clear that, for some developers, the endeavor is worthwhile.\nPearl House, a former 1970s office tower located in the bustling Seaport District,\u00a0opened its doors in late 2023 and is fully leased. The 588-unit conversion, developed by Vanbarton Group, was the largest office-to-resi conversion in NYC until SoMA.\nDevelopers RXR, SL Green, and Apollo Global Management recently filed plans to convert 5 Times Square into 1,000-plus apartments, theReal Deal reported. And, after years of rumors, plans to build high-end condominium units at the iconic Flatiron Buildingbecame official late last summer.\nThe former headquarters of Goldman Sachs, located at 55 Broad St., began leasing last fall. Metro Loft developed the property in partnership with Silverstein Properties. The former is also partnering with David Werner Real Estate Investmentsin the ongoing conversion of the old Pfizer headquarters in Midtown. It is slated for completion in 2027 with 1,602 apartments, easily surpassing SoMA.\nAdvertisement",

He declined the request.\nA spokesperson for the Obamas offered no comment, and the Foster family opted not to disclose their reasons for selling.\nThe listing, handled by Maggie Gold Seelig of MGS Group Real Estate and Brian Dougherty of Corcoran Property Advisors, enters a cooling luxury market on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\nThe island\u2019s median home sale price fell to $1.1 million in April, a 32.2% drop from the previous year.

        "content": "This home could be talkin\u2019 to you.\nIn Brooklyn\u2019s coveted Park Slope, a historic townhouse at 38 Garfield Place has emerged from a meticulous renovation to hit the market for $6.25 million. And it comes with some real mob history.\nThe five-story residence was once the home of infamous gangster Al Capone in his younger years, The Post has learned.\nCapone\u2019s parents first moved to Park Slope in the 1880s and gave birth to him in 1899. He and his family eventually moved into this dwelling in the early 1900s when he was 11, remaining there until his early 20s.\n\u201cHe was born on Navy Street and then the family needed more space,\u201d said listing representative Nadia Bartolucci of Douglas Elliman. \u201cSo they then moved over to Park Slope \u2026 And the family owned the home for a couple of decades.\u201d\nThe future crime lord, later dubbed \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1,\u201d resided here until 1919, when he relocated to Chicago \u2014 where he built a criminal empire through bootlegging, prostitution and gambling.\nConvicted of tax evasion in 1931, Capone served eight years in prison and died in 1947 at age 48.\nThe property, redeveloped by Minerva Development, a real estate development firm, underwent a dramatic transformation from what Bartolucci described as an \u201cuninhabitable\u201d state into a 4,000-plus-square-foot masterpiece.\nThe Capone family\u2019s tenure at 38 Garfield Place was followed by a single owner until Minerva bought it in February 2024.\n\u201cWhen the home was acquired, it required a full remodel, a full renovation,\u201d Bartolucci told The Post. \u201cThey did a complete ground-up renovation and turned it into an exquisite \u2026 triple-mint townhouse and it is beautiful.\u201d\nThe developer preserved the home\u2019s historic brick front, while expanding its footprint and incorporating premium materials.\nThe reimagined townhouse now boasts four bedrooms, five full bathrooms, three powder rooms and a finished cellar across five floors.\nSunlit rooms and oversize windows define the interiors, with high-end finishes like Italian marble, bespoke millwork and Carrara marble fish-scale tiles elevating every space.\nThe chef\u2019s kitchen features a Calcutta Oro countertop island and top-tier appliances, including a Sub-Zero refrigerator and Bosch microwave. A formal dining area flows into the kitchen.\nThe garden level includes an open-concept great room with double-height ceilings, a wet bar, and access to an outdoor patio. A home office and versatile recreation room \u2014 suitable for a gym, a music studio or a wine cellar \u2014 add functionality.\nUpstairs, the primary suite boasts a private terrace, an expansive dressing room and a spa-like bathroom featuring dual rain showers, a soaking tub and Calacatta Viola marble mosaics.\nThe fourth floor houses two secondary bedrooms, each with en-suite baths \u2014 while the top floor offers a bedroom, a full bath, and a solarium with a skylight and terrace boasting views of Prospect Park and lower Manhattan.\nBartolucci also represented the nearby 21 Garfield Place \u2014 once home to Capone\u2019s extended family \u2014 when it listed in 2020.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nMassachusetts flunked a new Realtor.comreporton housing, earning an F for failing to build enough homes and keep them affordable. The Bay State ranked among the worst scores in the nation.\nThe report considers a home affordable if the mortgage payment on it makes up 30% or less of a household\u2019s monthly income.\nFor each state, the report calculated how much of the median household income would be spent on a mortgage for the median-priced home listed in 2024, assuming a 10% down payment and a mortgage rate of 6.75%.\nFor Massachusetts, which ranked 50th overall, the median listing price was $781,758, with a median household income of $96,584.\n\u201cIt has become harder and harder to become a homeowner, with high prices and mortgage rates remaining the unfortunate reality, and increasing the supply of homes is the clear solution,\u201d the report said.\nOnly 18 states, primarily in the Midwest and South, can claim that their median home is affordable.\nSince the Great Recession, ahousing supply gaphas emerged nationwide due to a decade of underbuilding, leaving the country short of around 4 million homes.\n\u201cOnce housing eats up more than a third of your paycheck, it\u2019s not just expensive \u2014 it also puts real pressure on everything else in life,\u201d the report said.\nOne major factor leading to unaffordable housing is zoning.\nWhile a comprehensive analysis of zoning was beyond the scope of the report, the state serves as an example of how complex, hard-to-navigate zoning can hinder affordable housing.\nThe report referenced theNational Zoning Atlas, a project that records approximately 30,000 U.S. zoning codes. The report states that Massachusetts has 16 zoning districts per jurisdiction and 131 pages of zoning code for each jurisdiction. Of the state\u2019s 7 million acres, 76% are subject to zoning.\n\u201cAll of this regulatory complexity costs builders time and money, and those costs are passed on to homeowners,\u201d the Realtor.com report said.\nZoning prohibits many projects from the get-go, with just 12% of zoned acres allowed for multi-family housing as of right.\n\u201cThese artificial restrictions limit the supply of housing in the state and will continue to result in Massachusetts struggling with affordable housing,\u201d the report said.\nPublic officials have tried to simplify the zoning process.\nIn 2022, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu signed anexecutive orderaimed at prioritizing city approvals of affordable housing developments to halve the time it takes to approve projects.\nThe Affordable Homes Act, which Gov. Maura Healeysignedinto law last summer, includes a statewide zoning change that allows people to build accessory dwelling units on their property.\nSo far, efforts have not panned out.The Boston Business Journalreports that housing starts in Greater Boston in the first quarter of the year were the lowest since 2013. The year-to-date total is down 38% through March, the most significant drop since 2008.\nMassachusetts isn\u2019t the only New England state to earn an F.\nRhode Island ranked worst on the affordability scale, with a median listing price of $537,521 and a median income of $80,791. Connecticut fared slightly better, albeit still with an F score, with a median listing price of $517,849 and a median income of $89,717.\nOther states with F grades include California, Hawaii, New York, and Oregon. Iowa, Texas, and South Carolina earned A\u2019s on the report.\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "How much should newlyweds save for a down payment?",
        "content": "Couples used to get gravy boats and fine china aswedding gifts, but now, with interest rates and housing prices on the rise, more newlyweds are asking for\u00a0cold, hard cash\u00a0to plunk down on a\u00a0home.\n\u201cMost couples have already been living together by the time they get married, so they are less interested in registering for toasters and espresso machines, as they already have household items,\u201d says\u00a0Cara Ameer, real estate broker at\u00a0Coldwell Banker Vanguard Realty\u00a0in Florida. \u201cWhat they lack is a nest egg to buy a home.\u201d\nAccording to a recentLendingTree survey, 48% of homeowners who tied the knot in the past two years asked for down payment assistance from wedding guestsin lieu of traditional presents\u2014and 26% said they put more money down on a home purchase because of money they received at their wedding.\n\u201cI recently worked with a couple who used part of their wedding gifts to help with their down payment,\u201d says Florida real estate agent\u00a0Ron Myers. \u201cWith housing prices staying high, I think more couples may start looking at gift money as a way to get into theirfirst homefaster. It gives them a head start without taking on more debt.\u201d\nWhile to some it might seem gauche, gift money is one smart way to move toward your dream of owning a home\u2014without too many tax implications.\nThe common rule of thumb for homebuyers is to aim for a down payment of 10% to 20% of the home\u2019s purchase price.\nFor example, a\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0report released earlier this month\u00a0found that homebuyers paid $29,900 on average for a down payment and 14.4% as a share of the purchase price in 2024.\nBut the down payment is only one of the upfront costs needed to buy a house. In addition, buyers need to save for closing costs.\nThese fees, paid to third parties to help facilitate the sale of a home,\u00a0typically total 2% to 7%\u00a0of the home\u2019s purchase price.\nThe median home price in March 2025 grew to\u00a0$424,900\u2014which means the average closing costs would range between $8,498 and $29,743.\nIn recent years, bride and grooms have asked their guests to gift money earmarked for specific usage, like honeymoon activities and home furnishings. Money gifted for usage toward a down payment is not unheard of. In fact, it\u2019s become fairly commonplace. But gift money does need to be declared on your taxes.\nWhether you\u2019re a wedding guest or a wealthy family member, an individual can\u00a0gift\u00a0up to $19,000 to a single recipient, or $38,000 to a married couple,in 2025without incurring\u00a0gift tax liability, according to\u00a0Fred Goncher\u00a0of Backyard Mortgage Corp. in\u00a0Garnerville, NY.\nBut exceeding the annual gift tax exclusion doesn\u2019t mean you have to pay a gift tax\u2014it simply means you need to submit IRS Form 709 to disclose the gift.\nYou have to pay taxes only if you exceed the lifetime gift tax exemption\u2014which is $13.99 million for single filers, and $27.98 million for married couples filing jointly.\n\u201cGift tax is not something regular people should ever fear,\u201d says Goncher.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nBut what about estate taxes?\n\u201cUnless the gift is in the eight figures, those will not apply, either,\u201d says Goncher.\nIf you were receiving a lump-sum gift from one person, you\u2019d likely need a gift letter for the lender explaining the source of funds.\n\u201cHowever, since getting a gift letter from wedding gift givers would be impractical, lenders instead ask for evidence of the wedding and a copy of the deposit made after the wedding,\u201d says Goncher.\nWhat are the pros and cons of using\u00a0gift\u00a0money\u00a0versus a conventional loan?\nIf your cash gift is enough to pay for the property outright, \u201cpaying cash is often a quicker and simpler process versus obtaining a loan where you will be asked to supply documentation about your income, assets, and tax returns to the lender,\u201d says Ameer.\nIf you are financing the property, current Fannie Mae rules consider a documented gift to be the same as the borrower\u2019s own funds, according to Goncher.\nThere might be a little more paperwork involved, but \u201chaving gifts funds can reduce the cash needed for down payment and closing costs,\u201d says Goncher. That is a win-win.\nAdvertisement",

The caboose was there when Duchovny bought the property, the Journal reported, which he initially rented from \u201cThe X-Files\u201d creator Chris Carter.\nDuchovny spent about $1 million renovating the train car into a guesthouse, according to the outlet. The space consists of a sleeping area, a built-in dining nook, a bathroom with a rainfall shower and a rooftop deck.\nSpeaking with the outlet, Duchovny called the caboose reno \u201cone of the things I\u2019m most proud of that I\u2019ve ever developed in my life.\u201d\nDuchovny, 64, raised his two children in Malibu. He told the outlet that he is selling the property now that they are both grown.\nCompass\u2019s Chris Cortazzo, who holds the listing, praised the indoor-outdoor flow of the home as capturing \u201cthe spirit of the Malibu lifestyle.\u201d\nThat Malibu lifestyle includes deeded access to a private beach entrance.\nCortazzo said he expects sales to pick up in Malibu with the much-anticipated reopening of the Pacific Coast Highway following the wildfires early this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strong demand from displaced residents looking for homes,\u201d Cortazzo said. \u201cI believe insurance payouts are starting to come through, and rather than waiting to rebuild, many people are turning to Malibu, drawn by the lifestyle we offer.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

The main home was left in place on its original foundation, and the eastern wing was relocated two doors down. Less than a month after the five-bed, three-bath (two full, one half) home went viral for its notable history, it\u2019s now on the market for $1.5 million.\nThe truth about its unusual journey was only unearthed after owners Vissia Viglietta and Adam Shutes realized that the eastern wall appeared a bit unusual.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "For 90 years, the brick monastery on the edge of the Arnold Arboretum was home to the Poor Clare Nuns of Boston. Rarely open to anyone outside the cloistered religious order, the three-story property and its surrounding gardens were designed for a life of contemplative prayer. Last May, the nuns moved to Westwood, and it\u2019s been empty for almost a year.Now city officials, the developer set to buy the monastery, and the abutting Arboretum and those who love it are navigating a tricky balancing act: How to preserve the Gothic Revival structure, build much-needed housing, and still protect and preserve the 281-acre museum of trees next door.Developer John Holland plans to transform the Poor Clare Nuns Monastery in Jamaica Plain into 38 units of senior housing and build an 85-unit condo building behind the existing monastery.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAfter months of debate, Wellesley-based developer Sixteen Penny Co. \u2014 which has the three-acre site under a purchase agreement \u2014 this winter proposed renovating the existing monastery into 38 affordable senior apartments and putting a new four-story, 85-unit condo building between the monastery itself and the brick wall where the Arboretum starts. In April, city officials sent the project back to the drawing board, asking for changes that would address \u201ccommunity concerns\u201d over shadows and views, a Planning Department spokesperson confirmed.Related: Spring is on the landscape: Signs of the season blossom all around the Arnold ArboretumAdvertisement\u201cStaff have asked the developer to explore design scenarios that would address the community concerns around shadow impact, and view sheds,\u201d Planning Department spokesperson Brittany Comak said in an email.It\u2019s the latest example of the delicate dance required when balancing the tremendous need for more housing in a dense, historic, and expensive city. The project proposes a pick up/drop-off plaza between the properties. HacinCity Hall and the Arboretum agree on the need to build more affordable housing, but are pushing  to do it in a way that protects one of the region\u2019s crown jewels of public space. Developer John Holland, who partnered with the Poor Clare sisters to relocate their order, has spent years grappling with the site\u2019s sensitivities. He\u2019s eager to build senior apartments but needs a plan that will attract investors, or nothing will be built at all.AdvertisementHolland and the 920 Centre St. design team have already scaled back. Earlier plans for the project included a five-story condominium between the monastery and the Arboretum, but the design team trimmed the new building down a floor and slimmed its overall size, said architect David Hacin of Hacin + Associates in a March public meeting.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to both pull the building back away from the brick wall and to lower the height,\u201d Hacin said. \u201cWe do know there will be some visibility of the project through the trees in the winter months, but I do want to emphasize that it will be considerably below the tree canopy and only seen through the filter of trees that currently exist.\u201dRelated: From 2022: Nuns ponder the future of their landmark monastery in Jamaica PlainBut walk along the rear perimeter of the Arboretum \u2014 on a path that may not be official but is certainly well-trod \u2014 and there\u2019s a clear view of the rear of the monastery, which sits atop a hill that slopes steeply downward toward the Arboretum and its Hunnewell visitor center. Even with the scaled-down plans, the design layout as proposed would mean the modern condo building is visible from the Arboretum\u2019s Hunnewell entrance and visitor center. The Arboretum also expressed concern that a construction project \u2014 especially one that included digging for an underground parking garage \u2014 could upset tree roots on their property.AdvertisementThe monastery can be seen through the trees on the Arnold Arboretum property.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeThe Arboretum contends that an 18-foot setback violates existing zoning laws \u2014 particularly the city\u2019s Greenbelt Protection Overlay District, which aim \u201cto enhance and protect the natural scenic resources of the city,\u201d per Boston\u2019s zoning code. They\u2019ve tapped their own architecture firm \u2014 Atelier Ten \u2014 to create renderings of the project, as viewed from the Arboretum\u2019s property.While development disputes between neighbors can get quite testy, the disagreement between the Arboretum and the development team is marked by a sense of respect and civility. William \u201cNed\u201d Friedman, the Arboretum\u2018s director and a Harvard University biology professor, emphasized the \u201cthoroughly professional and respectful and transparent\u201d conversations and noted that the development team has shared data and other studies so Arboretum leadership could seek out other opinions.But to the Arboretum \u2014 where nearly 3,000 of the 16,000 trees belong to species that are threatened with extinction \u2014 nearly any threat can feel existential.\u201cThis is something that will loom over our living collection,\u201d Friedman said at a recent public meeting. \u201cEverything about this historic landmark has to be thought through exceedingly carefully. \u2026 Being able to grow trees that are healthy and robust, especially in a world with changing climate, is incredibly important.\u201dWilliam \"Ned\" Friedman, director of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, stood on  Arboretum land in front of where a developer is planning to build a senior housing project, with a new four-story condo building behind it.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeIn an April 9 letter filed to the Boston Planning Department, Holland said his team would work closely with the Arboretum in developing alternative plans, which it will file in the coming weeks.\u201cWe acknowledge the importance of the Arnold Arboretum as a valuable community asset and a significant historical landscape. We are committed to carefully considering the potential visual impacts of our development,\u201d Holland wrote. \u201cWe firmly believe that the 920 Centre Street redevelopment will not adversely affect the health of the Arboretum\u2018s trees, a position supported by scientific and biological evidence.\u201dAdvertisementThe letter shared the results of studies that examine the amount of shadow projected to be cast by a certain building during specific times of the year. The Arboretum, which has used data from the development team to pursue its own shadow studies, contends that at some points \u2014 particularly in late summer \u2014 there could be as much as 4 hours of new shadows cast over plants from the rear of the monastery across to the Arborway.In Boston, state law manages the amount of shadow that can be cast on the Public Garden and Boston Common \u2014 though not on the rest of the Emerald Necklace park system. Karen Mauney-Brodek, the president of the nonprofit Emerald Necklace Conservancy, said a wave of development on areas surrounding the Emerald Necklace highlights the need for more specific city policy governing sunshine and shadows over ecologically sensitive areas.It\u2019s difficult to highlight the totality of a potential shadow problem when discussing development on a project-by-project basis, Mauney-Brodek said, especially when the state is facing such a housing shortage.\u201cWe have to balance all of these things, and parks and open space are losing,\u201d Mauney-Brodek said. \u201cPolicy is desperately needed. ... It feels very haphazard, right now, what\u2019s allowed in one place and not another.\u201dAs part of its agreement to develop a large-scale mixed-use project on Simmons University\u2019s Fenway residential campus \u2014 which abuts the Emerald Necklace \u2014 Swedish building giant Skanska in late 2022 agreed to a $1 million donation to study shadow impacts on the park system. And the city last year launched a $400,000 study of light and shadow on the Back Bay Fens and Riverway Parks, which is expected to wrap up later this year.AdvertisementThe proposed four-story condominium as currently proposed would stand within 18 feet of the Arboretum\u2019s property line. Zoning standards require a 50-foot setback. Atelier TenChris Vaughan, a member of the JP YIMBY \u2014 or, \u201cYes In My Backyard\u201d \u2014 coalition, said the benefit of more housing outweighs concerns over shadows.\u201cI think this project would provide more people access to the Arboretum, which is the absolute crown jewel of the neighborhood,\u201d he said.For its part, the Arboretum intends to complete its own shadow studies, Friedman said \u2014 studies that will be shared with Holland and the 920 Centre St. development team.\u201cEvery tree here has a story. Every tree here has a purpose,\u201d Friedman said at the March public meeting. \u201cThese are museum objects that we have been working for 153 years to share with the public.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

It has some 831 active job postings, is planning a 4,000-job advanced manufacturing plant in Ohio, and has raised some $4.34 billion since its founding in 2017, according to Pitchbook. It has since developed dozens of hardware products like autonomous fighter jets for the US Air Force, autonomous submarines for the Australian Navy, and counter-drone technology.

        "subhead": "Don\u2019t go cheap on listing photos, which can either help or hinder attracting buyers.",
        "content": "By Megan Johnson, The Boston Globe\n\nKate Zieglerhad a laugh when she saw a listing photo for a spacious suburban home with a centered Palladian window.\n\nWhile the photos were clearly taken in the middle of winter \u2014 indicated by the coating of snow on the treetops and backyard \u2014 the snow-laden front yard had been digitally edited to appear bright green with dotted snowflakes interspersed over it.\n\n\u201cThey just took a snowscape and threw some grass over it on one section of the lawn, and called it good enough,\u201d said Ziegler, a realtor withArborview Realtyin Boston.\n\nThat certainly wasn\u2019t the first time Ziegler has spotted a bad edit on a real estate listing photo. There was the artificial-looking sunset filter featuring jewel-toned skies slapped on a photo taken at high noon, or the house where all the outlets had been photoshopped out. In a digital world, photo editing and virtual staging are tremendous tools that can help take a listing\u2019s photo from meh to marvelous in just a few clicks. But a heavy-handed edit can lead to your listing going viral for the wrong reasons \u2014 and send your potential buyers to some other open house.\n\nConsider the way you feel when you see a heavily edited photo of a person on Instagram or Facebook. In the same way, a photo of a house that has gone through excessive enhancement tends to strike prospective buyers as suspicious.\n\n\u201cListing photos are more important than ever for sellers, since so much of the house hunt happens online,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cThey get to a house in person and they go, \u2018Well, this doesn\u2019t look anything like what I expected.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgents will sometimes take photos of a property themselves as a means of saving money on a photographer. That\u2019s a mistake, saidSarah Maguire, principal of theAranson Maguire Groupat Compass, who notes that prospective buyers always notice a bad iPhone photo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen absolute disasters. If you\u2019re a broker, you should be paying for professional photos and special editing,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cYou can tell from a mile away when something is not done professionally. Even if it\u2019s the nastiest place, professional photography does help.\u201d\n\nWhile subtle retouching doesn\u2019t hurt, Ziegler said it\u2019s better to get great professional photos rather than relying on excessive editing. Using the correct lenses, angles, and lighting goes a long way. \u201cWe want it to feel like what people expected when they walk in the door,\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s what isn\u2019t removed from a listing photo that has the biggest effect on the potential buyer\u2019s opinion. Maguire said simple mistakes \u2014 like a toilet seat left up or a prescription pill bottle sitting on the bathroom counter \u2014 convey an air of carelessness. Kitchen counters and bedroom dressers filled with items take the attention off the property\u2019s features and onto your clutter.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen photos with dirty dishes in the sink,\u201d she laughed.\n\nMaguire uses a checklist to get listings prepped for photos, everything from removing shampoo bottles from the shower to clearing away cobwebs.\n\n\u201cHalf the battle of our job is getting a place show-ready. And that sometimes does not come easily,\u201d she added, noting that a few family photos are OK to leave around the house if you\u2019re comfortable with the internet seeing them.\n\nWhen it comes to furry friends, some realtors are comfortable with showing a family pet in listing photos, as it might encourage prospective buyers to imagine their own dog or cat curled up by the fireplace. But there\u2019s a sharp line between a single pet and three cats wandering through your listing photos.\n\n\u201cI love when animals are included in photos,\u201d saidMeg Grady, an agent withLantern Residential/EastieLove. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s staged, not just a blurry dog walking through.\u201d\n\nPolitical flags and signage can be another issue. Agents want their properties to have the least amount of personalization as possible in the hopes that it will cater to a larger net of prospective buyers. But that can get complicated when existing residents display signage, particularly when it\u2019s political.\n\n\u201cUnder freedom of speech, you have to tread very lightly about asking people to remove signage. During the last election, I had a multifamily building. One unit had a peace sign, and one had a Trump sign,\u201d Grady said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask one person to remove theirs and the other not to, so we very sensitively said there should be no signage of any sort draping from the building.\u201d\n\nToo much seasonal decor in photos also can signal trouble. While holiday decorations might make a spot look extra cozy, the time window that it\u2019s applicable is slim. The same goes for anything that makes it too clear the seasons in which the photos were taken.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re heavy on mums and fallen leaves and the house is still on the market in March, then people will be like, \u2018Well, why is this still on the market?\u2019\u201d said Jess Harrington ofFinessed Home Staging. \u201cIf you pull the listing and put it back on later, it doesn\u2019t actually look like a new listing. It looks like a listing from last fall.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a glaring issue with the house \u2014 like a blighted property next door \u2014 agents are generally in agreement that disclosing the downsides of a home upfront is ultimately a service to the prospective buyer.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you want them to come and look at it, but you don\u2019t want somebody to feel like you pulled the wool over their eyes,\u201d Grady said.\n\nZiegler said she also operates from a perspective that more transparency is best.\n\n\u201cYou can find the right buyer for anything, if you price reasonably,\u201d she added. \u201cNot every house needs to be everything for everyone, but you need to be, in my opinion, honest about what a house is and who it\u2019s good for.\u201d\n\nMegan Johnson can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

Ellement, The Boston Globe\n\n51 Robey St., Unit 51 Roxbury\n\n$739,000\n\nStyleTown house\n\nYear built2018\n\nSquare feet1,410\n\nBedrooms3\n\nBaths2 full, 1 half\n\nSewer/WaterPublic\n\nFee$185 month\n\nTaxes$8,464 (2025)\n\nA good way to envision this home is to think of yourself as \u201cCasey at the Bat\u201d \u2014 but with an ending different than a strikeout. In this scenario, Casey hits a triple. (Let\u2019s save the strikeouts for the Yankees.)\n\nLocated in Roxbury, this town house has three levels, a private fenced backyard for this unit only with both grass and a paving stone patio, and a hot tub that comes with the house.\n\n\nFrom the sidewalk, a wide slab of concrete leads to the two steps of the front porch, where entries to the two units are located. Unit 51 is on the right.\n\nBeyond the front door and to the immediate left is the stairwell to the two upper floors. On the right is the open floor plan that contains the living room in the front with the kitchen adjacent to the rear. Also on this level is a half bath and an exit to the backyard.\n\nThe 280-square-foot living room has a pair of double-hung windows on the front exterior wall, and a second pair of the same design on the right exterior wall. Sandwiched between in a column is a gas fireplace topped by a perfect spot for a television. There is thick crown molding and recessed lighting across the ceiling. Flooring here and in the rest of the home is oak.\n\n\nThere is unhindered access into the 160-square-foot kitchen with a long island for four seats. Lighting is from three graceful silvery pendant lights. The island, which provides additional storage, is topped with whitequartz, the same material used for the countertops. The island cabinet is white as are the two levels of cabinets.The appliances \u2014 including the gas stove \u2014 are stainless steel. The backsplash is tile in various shades of gray.\n\n\nAdjacent to the kitchen is the 22-square-foot half bath with tile flooring and a single vanity with a white sink atop a vanity with a natural wood finish.\n\nA windowed door off the kitchen opens into the backyard.\n\nThe stairwell in the living room connects to the second level and a 22-foot-long hallway. The full bath \u2014 and laundry closet \u2014 are sandwiched between two secondary bedrooms that occupy the front and back of the floor.\n\nThe larger of the two bedrooms, at 150 square feet, is in the rear of the house and has a total of five double-hung windows on all three exterior walls. There is thick crown molding, oak flooring, and recessed lighting. The other secondary bedroom, at 102 square feet, is now set up as a home office.\n\n\nThe 50-square-foot full bath has a shower/bath combination behind a curtain. The single vanity is white and topped with granite that has a black with a bit of grey design. The flooring and walls \u2014 including the backsplash \u2014are two complimentary colors of gray porcelain tile.\n\nA key feature of this floor is the windowed door in the hallway, which opens to the balcony overlooking Robey Street.\n\n\nReturning to the stairwell and ascending to the third floor leads to the three-room primary suite, which occupies the entire level.\n\nThe bedroom is 360 square feet and has a double-hung window on the rear exterior wall, the perfect spot for the bed. A second window is snuggled into a corner of the room. A comfort-adding addition is the gas fireplace with white mantle that also creates a nice location for a television.\n\n\nJust off the bedroom is the private bath, which at 69 square feet is a larger iteration of the second-floor bath. There is a white single vanity with a black granite top flecked with gray and white. Porcelain tile covers the flooring, and a shower/bath combination is behind a curtain. The increased size creates room for an in-bath linen closet.\n\nThe final space is a 165-square-foot walk-in closet large enough for double-hung windows on two exterior walls. Currently, there are cabinets and built-in shelving lining the walls, along with a desk set underneath one of the windows.\n\n\nThere is an exterior storage shed and two off-street parking spaces.\n\nJoe Parrishof EVO Boston in Everett has the listing.\n\nJohn R.

It\u2019s expected to be completed in December 2031.\nProject renderings show that splashy oasis perched right atop the grand edifice, featuring plenty of room for swimming in the shadows of neighboring towers. Sunbathers will also have covered poolside seating.\nThe Trump skyscraper will stand in the city\u2019s Downtown, with views of the Arabian Sea. Not only will it house a hotel, but also apartments. Among the latter: two sky-pool penthouses, which the outlet notes have been modeled off New York City\u2019s Trump Tower penthouse.\nThe Sun notes that Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said: \u201cTrump International Hotel & Tower, Dubai is a project that reflects our unwavering commitment to excellence, luxury and innovation.\u201d\n\u201cDubai is a global destination that shares our vision for iconic development, and we\u2019re proud to expand the Trump brand in one of the most dynamic cities on earth.\u201d\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s more to come from Trump in the region, specifically in the neighboring Gulf nation of Qatar.\nAccording to a Wednesday press release, real estate investment company Qatari Diar signed an agreement with Dar Global \u2014 which is also involved in the Dubai tower \u2014 to develop Trump International Golf Club in the massive coastal Simaisma project located north of Doha. This Trump development will include a luxe 18-hole golf course, a golf club and a collection of Trump-branded villas that overlook the greens and the beach.\nBack in Dubai, the skyscraper will have one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments \u2014 while those duplex penthouses will come with four bedrooms. The branded hotel will be a five-star stay. Beyond the sea, the building will also offer views of the Burj Khalifa,which is hometo the \u201cSky Palace\u201d penthouse.\nThe Dubai edifice will also have a private club for members called The Trump.\nAdvertisement",

It relisted early in April for $11.94 million and quickly entered contract for an unknown sum.\nKnight Frank agents Oliver Rodbourne and Nigel Mitchell hold the listing.\n\u201cKnight Frank can confirm the property is now under offer and the necessary processes are underway to progress toward completion,\u201d the brokerage said in a statement to The Post.\nMilhanger includes a seven-bedroom main house and multiple out buildings spread across more than 70 wooded acres. Taylor\u2019s additions to the home, including a library and a games room, expanded the main house\u2019s footprint to nearly 20,000 square feet.\u00a0The home also features a heated indoor pool, a gym, a steam room and a Jacuzzi.\nRecent upgrades to the mansion include new windows, a layout redesign and a rebuilt orangery off the kitchen, according to the listing.\nThe property\u2019s outbuildings include a 450-year-old water mill, Cosford Mill. The mill now functions as a guesthouse with four bedrooms and two bathrooms.\nCosford Mill Studios has been variously credited as the recording studio behind some of Taylor\u2019s solo albums, including \u201cHappiness?\u201d and \u201cElectric Fire.\u201d\nThe Milhanger property also boasts a 2,300-square-foot \u201cparty barn.\u201d That barn was used by Taylor as a rehearsal space and the one-time site of a live streamed concert in 1998.

Taylor snapped up the property in the late 1970s at the height of Queen\u2019s fame.\nThe property\u2019s garden notably served as the snowy backdrop to music videos for Queen hits \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d and \u201cSpread Your Wings.\u201d\nTaylor wasn\u2019t the first rock drummer to be connected to the home, however.

        "content": "\n\nMaine\u00a0Republicans are pursuing a bill that would eliminate\u00a0property taxes\u00a0for longtime\u00a0senior residents. The movecould bring financial reliefto\u00a0retirees\u2014but it also raises serious questions about who will cover the cost.\nThe Pine Tree State ranks 17th in the nation for effective property tax rates, according to theTax Foundation. It\u2019s a middling position on paper that can hit especially hard for seniors on fixed incomes.\n\u201cWe have an aging population, and a lot of people on lower income in that age range, and it\u2019s just an incredibly unfair burden to put on them,\u201d House Minority Leader\u00a0Billy Bob Faulkingham\u00a0(R-Winter Harbor) toldWGME.\nBut property taxes are the lifeblood of local government, and if seniors are removed from the tax rolls entirely, younger Mainers could be left footing the bill.\nLD 1541would\u00a0eliminate property taxes\u00a0for Maine residents aged 65 and older who have lived in the state for 10 or more consecutive years. The state government would then be responsible for reimbursing local governments for the lost revenue.\nIt\u2019s just one of\u00a0several proposals\u00a0across the country this year to abolish property taxes, which are pinching homeowners of all ages as home values remain elevated and\u00a0push up tax bills, but it\u2019s unique in its focus on seniors.\nFor context, the median home in Maine cost just $249,000 in January 2020. Today, it\u2019s nearly doubled, to $462,500. That\u2019s pushed the state\u2019s median annual property tax bill to $4,223, according to\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0data.\nFor younger homeowners, that jump in equity can be a financial asset. But for retirees, the resulting spike in property taxes can becomea serious burden. The Pine Tree State isn\u2019t alone in this. Nationally, tax burdens are driving older Americans to\u00a0leave high-tax states\u00a0in search of more affordable places to\u00a0age in place.\nMaine\u2019s proposal could helpstop that outmigrationby allowing longtime residents to stay in their homes. But the bill\u2019s financial impact on the rest of the state remains a major question mark.\nLD 1541 does not yet include a fiscal note\u2014an official estimate of what it would cost\u2014and Faulkingham has acknowledged that he doesn\u2019t yet have a firm projection.\nStill, past efforts and Maine\u2019s demographics suggest the cost could be staggering.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Maine has tried to provide property tax relief to seniors in the state. A 2022 program froze qualifying seniors\u2019 property tax bills so they wouldn\u2019t increase year to year as home prices also rose.\nThat initiative cost the state $26 million and was repealed just 11 months after enactment due to its cost.\nIn addition to the price tag, critics of the freeze also pointed to loopholes that made it possible for well-off homeowners to apply the homestead exemption to their luxury homes. It\u2019s unclear if similar workarounds would be possible in LD 1541.\nKeep in mind, the 2020 initiative simply froze effective rates\u2014meaning that seniors were still responsible for payingsomeproperty taxes. The new proposal would eliminate them entirely, threatening a shortfall that could have severe consequences for the rest of the state.\nPart of the difficulty in Maine might be related to the simple fact that it\u2019s home to so many seniors. When measured by median age, Maine is the oldest state in the nation, and nearly a quarter of its population is over the age of 65, according to a 2024 report by theState Economist of Maine.\nNationally, nearly80% of seniors are homeownersand boomers (those aged between 61 and 79) hold\u00a0$84 trillion in real estate wealth. Assuming Maine seniors mirror these trends, local governments could lose a substantial portion of their revenue.\nAnd if the state can\u2019t fully cover the shortfall, homeowners under the age of 65 might be left picking up the tab, shouldering higher property taxes in a housing market that\u2019s already unaffordable for many.\nProponents of LD 1541 see it as a lifeline for Maine\u2019s aging population\u2014one that could help longtime residents stay in their homes despite rising costs.\nBut with no fiscal analysis and few guardrails in place, others worry the proposal could shift the financial burden onto younger generations\u2014especially in a state where nearly one in four residents is over 65.\nWithout clarity on how the state would reimburse municipalities or offset the potential cost of this proposal, it\u2019s not just a question of whether Maine can afford to help seniors; it\u2019s a question of whether doing so might come at the expense of younger Mainers.\nAs the bill moves forward, the challenge for lawmakers will be finding a way to support aging Mainers without undermining the financial future of the state they hope to keep calling home.\nAdvertisement",

The unit spans 1,087 square feet on the second floor of a grand, pinkish terracotta building.\nThe Early Renaissance-style mansion was designed in 1888 by architect Sir Ernest George.\nThe current owners of the flat could not be determined, but the property made headlines in 2019 when it was put up for rent,the Daily Mail reportedat the time.\nThe apartment is aptly situated above a cigar shop.\nBefore he was the prime minister who led Great Britain through the terror of the Blitz, Churchill lived at his mother\u2019s house.\nAfter making a name for himself as a soldier and war correspondent, Churchill moved out and into the Mount Street flat. He was 25 years old, according to the agencies, when he leased the two-bedroom from his wealthy cousin.\nChurchill moved into the flat in 1900, the same year he published \u201cIan Hamilton\u2019s March,\u201d a book about his experiences in the Second Boer War. His first year in the apartment also coincided with his narrow election to Parliament.\nThe well-appointed home boasts nine double-height windows overlooking Mount Street and a bright reception room.\u00a0The large principal suite has a bay window, built-in mirrored wardrobes and an ensuite shower.\nThe separate kitchen off the entrance hall features white cupboards, white stone worktops and flooring.\u00a0Churchill reportedly used the apartment\u2019s second bedroom as a breakfast and dining room.\n\u201cHomes lived in by Sir Winston Churchill always generate significant interest and we anticipate this elegant apartment in the heart of Mayfair will attract many discerning potential buyers from around the world,\u201d said Peter Wetherell, the founder and executive chairman of Wetherell, said in a statement.\nIn the home Churchill entertained politicians and pursued unlucky love affairs \u2014 including a 1903 flirtation with American actress Ethel Barrymore.He met his future wife, Clementine Hozier, at a ball in 1904.\nThe 1905 publication of a two-volume biography of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, allowed the 30-year-old Churchill to move out of his Mount Street apartment and purchase his own home, according to the agencies, on nearby Bolton Street.\nAdvertisement",

Hegemeier and Paul DeSantis of Premier Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nIt can be purchased in its entirety or in two separate parcels: $18.9 million for the main residence on 14 acres and $4.7 million for the remaining 8 acres, which include a barn and greenhouse.\nIf sold at asking price, the home could surpass Tampa\u2019scurrent record residential sale\u2014 Derek Jeter\u2019s $22.5 million transaction in 2021.\nHegemeier noted that luxury deals in the region have picked up recently as some affluent buyers seek a hedge against market volatility.\nWealthy buyers are paying all cash for real estate amid the stock market\u2019s unpredictability, Hegemeier said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A beachfront condominium in Marina del Rey, California once owned by rock legend Stevie Nicks has listed for $3.9 million, offering a rare glimpse into the early solo years of the Fleetwood Mac star, according to a press release.\nThe 2,091-square-foot residence, located on Outrigger Street just south of Venice Beach, features two bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and direct access to the sand, along with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe home, built in 1974, still reflects the bohemian aesthetic of its former occupant.\nAmong its period details are a sunken living room, wood-framed windows tilted to resemble a yacht\u2019s interior, and a bathroom adorned with vintage wallpaper.\nA glass-lined balcony faces the water, while the dining area \u2014 raised and outfitted with hardwood floors \u2014 connects to a carpeted living space.\nNicks occupied the property in the early 1980s as she transitioned into her solo career following her rise to fame with Fleetwood Mac.\nThe apartment even makes a brief appearance in the music video for \u201cEdge of Seventeen,\u201d from her debut solo album, \u201cBella Donna.\u201d\nBAM Magazine, in a 1981 profile, described the view from the living room as \u201can endless expanse of sand, ocean and sky.\u201d\nPhotographs from the period show Nicks in the space, surrounded by tropical plants and recording equipment, dancing in the kitchen and posing at a mirrored vanity. That mirror remains one of the unit\u2019s standout features.\n\u201cAs we walked into the primary bedroom, glamour hit us as we were met with a completely mirrored wall, mirrored dressing table and mirrored refrigerator \u2026 reflecting celebrity life!,\u201d Madeline Schwarzman, who purchased the condo with her husband, Philip, from Nicks in 1982, toldMansion Global, which reported on the listing.\nThe listing is held by Elana Besserman and Shelton Wilder of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California.\nBesserman is uniquely connected to the unit \u2014 she was born there and lived in the apartment until the age of 5, when her parents moved one floor up. They later purchased the upstairs unit in 1991.\n\u201cIt still feels very artistic and different,\u201d Besserman said of the building\u2019s creative atmosphere.\n\u201cEven in my parents\u2019 unit, people are always struck by the style, because it\u2019s very much an artist building.\u201d\nThe building contains just three units on a single level, a level of privacy that\u2019s rare for oceanfront properties in Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe privacy of the building with only 3 units and all one level is something very rare for an on-the-beach property,\u201d Besserman told The Post.\nResidents also have access to a shared rooftop and designated parking, including guest spaces in a nearby lot \u2014 an especially valuable feature in the often-congested beach zone.\n\u201cThe views are the price of admission. All you see is beautiful, white sand and the waves crashing,\u201d Wilder told The Post in an email.\nThough it\u2019s unclear exactly when Nicks acquired the property, listing agents and archival materials suggest she lived there for several years during the early 1980s.\n\u201cElana\u2019s parents purchased Unit 2 in 1982 from Stevie and then bought unit 3 in 1991,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cNo idea when Stevie bought it but based on the images of her in the space and the interviews that reference the home, she lived there for a few years.\u201d\nNow 76, Nicks remains based in Los Angeles and recently announced at the Pollstar Awards \u2014 where she was inducted into the Hall of Fame \u2014 that she\u2019s working on her first album in more than 10 years.\nHer inspiration came, she said, after being evacuated from her Pacific Palisades home during a wildfire and spending 92 days in a hotel room.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Livestream: Karen Read\u2019s lawyers finish Jennifer McCabe\u2019s cross-examination\nBy Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nAn issue that is coming up again and again with current and potential clients: Tariffs.\n\nWe are asked quite often, If prices are going up, should we order this or that now? Will we regret not getting these things in the pipeline now vs. later?\n\nWell, there is good news and bad news when it comes to pricing and lead times.\n\nThe good news is across the board, our various suppliers and subcontractors are not hearing of any drastic price increases in the near future. Most of the increases they are seeing are annual or seasonal fluctuations. Some increases such as HVAC equipment are due to new energy efficiency codes and new refrigerants that are being required. So far, steel and aluminum products have seen the largest increase in cost, but not enough to warrant any changes to buyer behavior.\n\nDuring the pandemic, suppliers only would hold prices for seven to 10 days. They are now back to the 30-day standard and almost all of them hold prices for longer than that.\n\nThe bad news is, we don\u2019t know how long this will last. For now, it would appear that things have calmed down and the supply chains are acting and reacting according to market demands, not arbitrary and disruptive external interventions. There is still a very high level of uncertainty in the marketplace, but no one is pressing the panic button just yet.\n\nAll to say that we are advising clients to proceed thoughtfully and avoid making rash decisions. If you are currently planning a remodel or a build-out, the best return on your investment is always a well-crafted plan developed in thoughtful collaboration with your builder.\n\nA READER RESPONDS ON KEEPING BASEMENTS DRY\n\nA reader wrote: \u201cGood morning, one more thought on drying out basements. We had a very damp basement and installed a heat pump water heater last year (with no thought about the dehumidifying effect.) While the installer said it would help with the moisture, the results were amazing! No more mold, no dampness, the entire house is drier in a typically cool, damp Vermont spring.\u201d\n\nAs always, we love reader feedback! Above is one response to my recent article about basement flooding or just plain damp basements. (\u201cAsk the Remodeler: Ways to keep your basement dry this spring\u201d). I thought this was interesting since it ties into a lot of the energy efficiency questions we get here.\n\nHeat pump water heaters should not be confused with standard electric water heaters, which use electrical resistance to heat and maintain a storage tank full of hot water. Very inefficient. The physics of how a heat pump water heater works are a little too wonky to get into here, but in general, they work like a refrigerator in reverse, using compressors and coils to treat the ambient air and heating it instead of cooling it.\n\nWhat would be happening in this reader\u2019s basement is that the excess warm air created in this process is being discharged into the surrounding area. The warm, dry air is helping to dry out the basement.\n\nI would never advocate installing this type of water heater just to dry out your basement. However, if you have a damp basement and a water heater that is on its way out, a heat pump water heater should be considered.\n\nOne caveat is that they are 240v and it will need a 30-amp circuit breaker. We see a lot of circuit panels maxed out these days as residential electrical demands have increased substantially. There are workarounds, so always consult with a licensed professional.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

However, the home has has been meticulously transformed inside and out since then, Kinlin said, noting the property has been expanded to include over\u00a05,000 square feet of exquisitely curated living and outdoor spaces.\n\u201cThe home was completely reimagined from a vintage seaside cottage into an elegant coastal retreat with panoramic ocean views from nearly every room. It captures the essence of what we all remember from summers on the Cape,\u201d\u00a0said Kinlin, noting the changes happened about six or seven years ago.\u00a0\u201cIt was stripped down, inside and out, and totally rebuilt, replumbed, with all new electrical, plumbing, heating, windows, doors, roof, and everything.\u201d\nA large circular driveway welcomes guests. Step inside the dramatic foyer to find whitewashed plank walls and beamed ceilings. The home establishes a luxurious cottage feel, while expansive windows capitalize on the view.\n\u201cThe views are outstanding,\u201d Kinlin said. \u201cNothing is blocking any of the views. There\u2019s a view from just about every room.\u201d\nA kitchen features a large center island, top-of-the-line appliances, and custom cabinetry. The bright sunroom, one of the expanded spaces in the home, features endless floor-to-ceiling windows that stream in natural light. The dining room, an ideal entertaining space, has French doors that open up to the lawn with a view of the Nantucket Sound.\nDirectly off the three-car garage is an office area, in case you have to put in some work hours during your summer vacation. That space has its own half-bathroom.\nSwift purchased the home from the Coleman family, longtime friends of the Kennedys and prominent Hyannis Port residents. The current owners rebuilt the sea wall and added a waterside swimming pool with a nearby fire pit. A stone patio provides ideal space for outdoor barbeques, and impeccable landscaping features rolling green lawns, all with the beauty of the ocean behind you. Just a quick flight of steps leads down to the private beach.\nAnother bonus:\u00a0 The property is not in the floodplain.\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Theincome neededfor a family to buy a typical home in the U.S. has surged by an eye-popping 70% over the past six years, highlighting the mounting\u00a0housing affordability\u00a0challenges.\nCompared with spring 2019, the national household income required to buy a median-priced home has jumped by nearly $47,000, largely driven by increasing home prices and elevated\u00a0mortgage rates, according to the\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae April 2025 Inventory Report.\nTo purchase a house at the national median list price of $431,250 in April, a household needed to earn about $114,000 annually.\nThat figure assumes a 30-yearfixed mortgage, a 20% down payment, and the \u201c30% rule,\u201d which recommends that consumers spend no more than 30% of their gross income on housing costs.\nThis means you would need to earn about $9,500 a month before taxes to comfortably cover the mortgage,\u00a0property taxes, and\u00a0insurance\u00a0on a typical home.\nBut there\u2019s a hitch: According to thelatest data from the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau, in 2023, the typical household earned just over $80,600 per year, or approximately 41% less than the recommended income.\nThe only bit of good news for potential homebuyers is that the required income has held mostly steady over the past year, largely because mortgage rates and median home prices have remained flat.\n\u201cWhile the income needed to purchase a home has leveled off nationally over the past year, it remains significantly higher than before the [COVID-19] pandemic, underscoring theongoing challenge of affordabilityeven as market conditions gradually rebalance,\u201d says Realtor.com Chief Economist\u00a0Danielle Hale.\nCompared with pre-pandemic levels, the income needed to buy a home has significantly increased in many areas across the U.S., with three metros in particular seeing the steepest spikes as of April 2025.\nMemphis, TN, topped the list, with a massive 94.8% surge in required annual income over the past six years.\nA person looking to buy a home in Memphis with a median price of $345,495 in April would have to earn $91,330 a year.\nProvidence, RI,\u00a0came in second, with the required income to buy a typical home there for $584,900 soaring by nearly 93% from April 2019, climbing to $154,615.\nLas Vegas\u00a0ended up in the No. 3 spot, with the household income needed to afford a typical $475,000 house jumping 86.5% over the past six years, to $125,564 annually.\nAmong the 50 largest metropolitan areas analyzed as part of the inventory report, three saw the smallest increases in required income, with the ever-affordable\u00a0Detroit\u00a0in the lead, with a modest 25.8% boost compared with April 2019.\nPut simply, a family looking to buy a median-priced home for $253,575 in the Motor City would require an annual income of about $67,000.\nSan Francisco\u00a0has experienced the second-smallest spike in required income, at 30.5%, since 2019, but that\u2019s little comfort considering that the typical home in the ultraexpensive tech hub costs $995,000, more than double the national median.\nA household needs at least $263,000 annually to afford it.\nChicago\u00a0saw the third-lowest uptick in required income, up 36.4% compared with April 2016.\nThat means that a family earning $98,455 per year in the Windy City can afford a home with the median price of $372,450.\nAdvertisement",

While dozens of lighthouses dot the Great Lakes, few remain operational \u2014 and even fewer are privately owned. This one is both.\n\u201cThe house retains a lot of its original integrity,\u201d Harlan Furbush, the Keller Williams Realty agent representing the listing, told theDemocrat & Chronicle.\u201cThere\u2019s just so much great history here.\u201d\n\u201cThe current owner is one of only four private owners,\u201d Furbush told The Post.\nPerched just west of Braddock Bay in a section known as Bogus Point \u2014 so named for its reputation as a drop point for counterfeit smugglers \u2014 the lighthouse was built in 1895 and first lit in 1896.\nCommissioned by Congress to close a 100-mile navigation gap along Lake Ontario\u2019s southern shore, it was constructed using elements salvaged from the Cleveland Lighthouse, including its ornate lantern room, cast-iron stairway and third-order Fresnel lens.\nThe octagonal red-brick tower originally rose 97 feet, but harsh upstate weather conditions took a toll. By the early 1950s, long vertical cracks compromised the tower\u2019s structure.\nThe light was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 1954, and the upper portion was dismantled shortly thereafter. The property fell into disrepair and was used by duck hunters before being purchased in 1957 by Walter and Kay Stone, who began an ambitious restoration.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget my first sight of this place,\u201d Kay Stone previously toldLighthouse Friends.\u201cIt had been unoccupied, neglected and weatherbeaten for years, but it withstood it all, and still stood there proud and strong.\u201d\nDecades later, a more extensive renovation in the 1990s culminated in the tower\u2019s reconstruction to 65 feet and its reactivation in 1996.\nToday, while the US Coast Guard still maintains the beacon and inspects it annually, the rest of the property is privately owned \u2014 making it a rare example of a \u201cliving lighthouse.\u201d\nThe listing includes a 3,000-square-foot Victorian keeper\u2019s home with a large kitchen, a formal dining room and a sunroom that faces the lake, along with at least three bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nThe lighthouse is attached to the home and accessible via a narrow spiral staircase that winds up to a lookout with sweeping views.\nThe 1.15-acre parcel also contains an 1,800-square-foot carriage house with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a six-car garage.\nHistorical documents, blueprints, original furnishings and other ephemera have passed from one owner to the next.\nWhile previous owners Don and Nandy Town operated the property as a bed and breakfast for over a decade, it is currently used as a private residence and an Airbnb.\nThe Towns, who stumbled upon the listing on their wedding anniversary in 2008, later said they believed they were destined to buy it.\n\u201cThey owned the Braddock Point Lighthouse and operated it as a very successful and popular Bed & Breakfast, as well a Florida Bed & Breakfast,\u201d Harlan told The Post, adding that he was the one that sold it for them back in 2020.\n\u201cThe current owner returned the home to a private residence and has enjoyed the opportunity to share in its history,\u201d Harlan said. \u201cOther opportunities in life have pulled him in another direction and it\u2019s time to pass on the legacy of Braddock Point to a proud new owner.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

That square footage would put the potential tower on the same level, space-wise, as the massive 55 Hudson Yards or Central Park Tower. The venture would sign a 99-year ground lease and have the option to extend another 99 years.\nThe past several years have seen the 1,025-key Roosevelt Hotel evolve from a shuttered relic to a major intake center for arriving migrants.

The Midtown hotel reopened in May 2023, this time as a migrant shelter and intake center.\nMayor Eric Adams announced the shelter\u2019s closure in February, citing a precipitous drop in the number of asylum seekers entering the city\u2019s care. More than 173,000 individuals signs up for services at the Roosevelt between May 2023 and February of this year, according to the city.\nAdams called the closure of the shelter a \u201cmilestone\u201d for the city.\nThe joint venture offer has not received an official response yet, but Bloomberg reported that Pakistan\u2019s Cabinet Committee on Privatisation is expected to consider the offer at its next meeting.\nPIA\u2019s advisor, JLL, was unable to be reached for comment.\nHow Burkhan might use the tower is yet unknown, but it would count the nearly finishedJP Morgan Chase headquartersand SL Green\u2019s One Vanderbilt as neighbors in the crowded office corridor.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin may be best known for its beer and brats, but these days it\u2019s serving up something else in high demand: apartments.\nOnce a sleeper city on the Lake Michigan shoreline, it\u2019s now one of the nation\u2019s most competitive rental markets.\nAccording to RentCafe, roughly 94% of rental units in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city were occupied at the start of 2025. With an average of eight prospective tenants competing for each apartment and 70.1% of renters opting to renew their leases, demand is far outpacing supply.\n\u201cYou might not think of Milwaukee as being hot, hot, hot, but that is what its housing market is right now,\u201d Suzanne Powers, broker-owner of Powers Realty Group, Inc. told theWall Street Journal.\nDriving the rental frenzy is a confluence of factors \u2014 steady job growth from companies like Northwestern Mutual and Rockwell Automation, a cost of living that remains relatively affordable and a lifestyle that offers big-city culture without big-city chaos.\nStill, these perks come with growing pains.\n\u201cThe lack of new supply is what\u2019s making Milwaukee a hot rental market,\u201d Chad Venne, real-estate program director at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, told the Journal.\nConstruction of single-family homes and condominiums stalled during the 2008 financial crisis and never returned to previous levels, Venne said.\nWhile apartment development picked up between 2013 and 2019, today\u2019s high interest rates and building costs have curbed new projects, especially for middle-income renters.\n\u201cNo one can figure out how to build for the people in the middle, who represent the largest percentage of the population,\u201d he added.\nAs a result, would-be buyers are remaining renters, keeping the pressure on an already tight market. The average rent in Milwaukee reached $1,541 in February 2025, a nearly 30% increase from five years earlier. The average unit size is 849 square feet.\nNearly 60% of households in Milwaukee are renter-occupied, with only 42% owning their homes, according to RentCafe. But it\u2019s not just young professionals fueling demand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proverbial traffic jam of demographics,\u201d Robert Monnat, senior partner at Milwaukee-based Mandel Group, Inc. told the Journal.\nMillennials priced out of homeownership, Gen Z newcomers entering the market and retirees downsizing while keeping a foothold in the city are all vying for the same limited stock.\nDevelopers catering to high-end renters are seeing strong returns.\n\u201cMilwaukee is home to four of the top five towers in the Midwest, excluding Chicago, with the highest asking rents per square foot,\u201d Sheldon Oppermann, CFO and general counsel at New Land Enterprises, said.\nAsking rents in top-tier buildings now hover between $3.50 and $3.90 per square foot, he said.\nAmong the most sought-after buildings downtown is 7Seventy7, a 34-story tower developed by Northwestern Mutual with luxury apartments spanning 24 floors.\nAnother is Ascent, a 25-story structure certified as the world\u2019s tallest timber building when it opened in 2022.\nRenters are also drawn to the Historic Third Ward, a former warehouse district now buzzing with entertainment and dining.\nThe amenities arms race is on full display. At Ascent, a penthouse unit offers timber interiors, smart technology and panoramic views of Lake Michigan. Residents share a retractable glass-walled pool and a rooftop bar. At 7Seventy7, offerings include a golf simulator, a Peloton studio, a dog run and a pet spa.\nYet for all its momentum, the city\u2019s housing future remains uncertain.\n\u201cIt will take several years for all of this to unwind \u2014 mortgage pricing, market value reset of existing homes for sale,\u201d Monnat said, adding, \u201cI believe that the transition will be orderly, given that we\u2019re not overbuilt.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

But over the years, Americans have found themselves in smaller digs. The average US apartment in 2024 reached 908 square feet, according to RentCafe.\nExperts point to, in part, higher demand for studios and one-bedrooms among a growing unmarried, childless professional class. It\u2019s well understood that young people in exciting, happening cities would trade a spacious home for a prime location.\nCities like New York and San Francisco, however, saw some of the most significant rental square footage growth among the metros analyzed.\nWith an average of 702 square feet, the typical rental in Queens is nothing to write home about, but it\u2019s an improvement from 2015. Rentals in Queens County gained 39 square feet over the past 10 years, RentCafe found, as developers focused on increasing the share of two- and three-bedroom apartments.\nBrooklyn saw a much more modest square footage upsize of 1%, or 6 square feet, since 2015. Kings County rentals currently reach an average of 708 square feet.\nManhattan apartments, along with Queens and Brooklyn, still rank among the smallest in the county nationwide, but at least there\u2019s a little extra room for a side table. Apartments in the borough grew by a modest 4 square feet over the past decade to a current average of 738 square feet.\nThe RentCafe study attributes the average growth to expanding one- and two-bedroom apartments, \u201callowing Manhattanites just enough space for a small pet without needing to compromise on that mini fridge.\u201d\nNew York City and San Francisco \u2014 where apartments gained 59 square feet \u2014 are exceptions to the rule. Apartment sizes decreased in a majority of the large metros studied, from Chicago to Orlando.\nThe biggest\u00a0apartments in the country\u00a0are concentrated far from New York, in the South. Rentals in Tallahassee and Gainesville, Florida, average 1,120 square feet, according to RentCafe. But apartments in Arlington, Texas saw the greatest loss of square footage of any city studied. Arlington rentals, on average, lost 215 square feet \u2014 nearly the size of the average American dorm room.\nAdvertisement",

That resulted in a median increase of $532 per year, to $1,641.\nOther states that saw the highest-dollar rent increases included Delaware ($447), Washington ($436), New Jersey ($422), and Maryland ($383), all of which have seen population growth.\u201cArizona, New Mexico, and Tennessee have all seen population spikes driven by factors likeretirement migration, strong job markets, low taxes, and a lower cost of living,\u201d\u00a0Kaycee Miller, real estate investor, landlord, and co-owner of Rentec Direct, tells\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae. \u201cThis influx is putting pressure on already strained housing supply, intensifying competition and pushing up rental prices.\u201d\nArizona\u2019s population grew by around270,000 peoplefrom 2019 to 2024, and Tennessee\u2019s population grew by around 300,000 in the same period.\nWhile other states like\u00a0South Carolina,\u00a0Alaska,\u00a0Idaho,\u00a0Montana, and\u00a0Wyoming\u00a0might not have high median rents\u2014Wyoming\u2019s monthly median rent, for instance, is $1,102\u2014they did see some of the most significant percentage increases across the board, of between 53% and 56%.\nMiller says it\u2019s because landlords in these states are able to price purely on demand.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cStates experiencing rapid population growth, limited housing supply, and no rent-control laws are seeing the steepest rent increases,\u201d says Miller. \u201cOf the 10 states where rents rose by 50% or more over the past five years, none have rent-control policies at the state level. Without rent control, it\u2019s not surprising to see more pronounced rent increases as housing providers adjust prices to keep pace with market value and remain competitive.\u201d\nWhile the majority of states saw rental increases, there were some surprising decreases around the country.\nIn\u00a0New York, the monthly median rent remains on the high side, at $1,394. However, research showed that the state experienced an increase of only about $160 from 2019 to 2024.\nIn\u00a0Louisiana, median rent prices decreased from $846 in 2019 to $825 in 2024, after peaking at $935 in 2023.\nThese shifts could signal that rental markets are finally beginning to stabilize in these areas.\nMinnesota, meanwhile, saw an impressive 34% decrease in rent over the past five years.\nIn 2019, median rent peaked at $1,285. By 2024, it had decreased to $849. Much of that is due to a concerted effort by the state, under itsMinneapolis 2040plan, to reduce single-family housing in favor of higher-density housing.\nAccording to Rentec\u2019s report, the most affordable rent in the country can be found in West Virginia ($693), Louisiana ($825), Minnesota ($840), Nebraska ($850), and South Dakota ($901).\nRentec\u2019s experts predict that inflation and high interest rates could cause rent price growth to slow. On the other hand, supply chain disruptions and tariffs could affect the availability and cost of new construction, which could put a premium on rental units in limited markets.\n\u201cRent control and stabilization policies aim to improve housing affordability, reduce displacement, and promote economic diversity\u2014especially in large cities,\u201d says Miller.\n\u201cBut they can also reduce availability, discourage investment and development, and increase market rents in areas without regulations. The challenge is finding balance in supply and demand for both landlords and tenants\u2014small, consistent rent increases help landlords keep pace with costs and market rates, while offering tenants more stable and predictable housing expenses.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "hed": "As construction costs rise, some in Cambridge question the city\u2019s affordable housing rules",
        "subhead": "",
        "content": "CAMBRIDGE \u2014 By now, the parking lot at 2400 Mass Ave. was supposed to be full of construction workers, building 60 condominiums a quick walk from the Red Line.But nearly a year since the project\u2019s developers \u2014 the local group North Cambridge Partners \u2014 finished their trudge through city permitting, this patch of prime real estate is still just a sparse storefront and a lot scattered with vehicles.Why? Despite its location on a main thoroughfare in one of the strongest housing markets in the world, the project won\u2019t make enough money to attract investors who will pay to build it, and the developers say a key city affordable housing policy is to blame. Cambridge is one of many local communities that require most new housing developments to include units set aside at below-market rents \u2014 in its case, 20 percent of the building, which is among the highest rates in Greater Boston \u2014 with the intention of creating more affordable homes in a city that is starved for them. This squat building at 2400 Mass. Ave. in Cambridge is set to be replaced with a 60-unit condominium building, but the project is stalled amid difficult financing.John Tlumacki/Globe StaffAdvertisementBut housing is so expensive to build right now that some developers say that this so-called inclusionary housing requirement may be backfiring, making otherwise profitable projects too costly to build and stopping them before shovels hit the ground. Put another way, a policy aimed at generating affordable housing may actually be preventing it. \u201cThe simple reality is that the math of the inclusionary policy is preventing development,\u201d said Daniel Sibor, managing partner of North Cambridge Partners. \u201dThe project we\u2019re doing is one where the numbers should work, and they just don\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisementInclusionary zoning is popular among many Greater Boston municipalities for the simple reason that it can generate affordable homes with no public money. At least half of the cities and towns in Greater Boston have some form of inclusionary zoning on the books, according to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. Together, they\u2019ve created thousands of income-restricted apartments.But lately, amid soaring costs for building materials and higher interest rates, developers and some local officials wonder if those policies might be doing more harm than good as they are currently written. And now some communities are evaluating whether to dial back their requirements in hopes of kicking construction back into gear. Related: The $600,000 problem: Why does it cost so much to build in Greater Boston?It\u2019s a tricky balance. Cities like Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville have increased their affordable housing requirements in recent years, leveraging their hot markets to create much-needed affordable housing. The prospect of lowering that requirement feels perverse, even if it may be a practical solution to generate more units.\u201cWe have a desperate need for affordable housing, and inclusionary [zoning] is our greatest tool for delivering it,\u201d said Ellen Shachter, director of Somerville\u2019s Office of Housing Stability. \u201cChanging it would have to be a last resort.\u201dCambridge first passed its policy in 1998, mandating developers set aside 15 percent of units in projects 10 units or larger at rates that are affordable to people making 80 percent of the Area Median Income (or roughly $130,000 for a family of four) or less. In 2018, amid the pre-COVID real estate boom, the City Council hiked that to 20 percent.AdvertisementIn 2018, Cambridge increased requirements for affordable housing in most new buildings, but construction has fallen sharply amid higher interest rates and costs.David L. Ryan/Globe Staff/David L Ryan, Globe StaffAnd it worked. Since the 1990s, the program has created just shy of 1,600 units of affordable housing in Cambridge and developers were still building projects under the 20 percent requirement for a few years after it went into effect.Then came 2022, when the economy of building homes in the US began to shift. Materials costs soared, and interest rates more than doubled. Not only did those changes reduce builders\u2019 profit margins, they also made investors more skeptical of the return on investment from housing, so they began demanding higher margins to finance projects. Altogether, those factors dramatically increased the cost of building homes. And while setting aside 20 percent of a project\u2019s units at below-market rents may have been sustainable three years ago, it is a lot harder now, said Sibor.The project at 2400 Mass. Ave. helps explain why. With 60 condominium units, North Cambridge Partners figured their project would generate about $108 million in sales if all the units were sold at market prices, said Tim Rowe, the developer\u2019s lead investor, who is also the founder and CEO of the Cambridge Innovation Center. But with 12 of those units sold at far-lower \u201caffordable\u201d prices under the city\u2019s inclusionary rule, that amount drops to about $90 million.The developers figure they\u2019ll sell the market rate units at somewhere around $1,500 per square foot, or perhaps a bit less. That\u2019s a very steep figure, one that\u2019s partially driven by high construction costs and the need to offset the discount on the affordable units. The price for affordable units, under the city\u2019s rules, would come in closer to $275 per square foot.AdvertisementRowe estimates the six-story, 72,000-square-foot building would cost $85 million to build, leaving the developers with $5 million in profit. But to come up with that $85 million to begin with, they\u2019d need to find an equity investor willing to put up about 35 percent of the money \u2014 $30 million \u2014 and then borrow the rest. The investors the developers have talked with about financing the project are seeking such a high rate of return that the project would need to net roughly $16 million, Rowe said, $11 million more than what the developers currently project to make.In other words, the $18 million the developers would lose on the inclusionary units, even with the market rate units set at luxury prices, is quite consequential. \u201cIt\u2019s lots of fun to say f\u2014 capitalism and f\u2014 developers, but we rely on developers to build the city, and in order to do that, they have to make money to pay the people that fund the projects,\u201d said Patrick Barrett, a Cambridge zoning attorney. \u201cRight now, you\u2019ve got a bunch of different social interests digging into the bottom line of a building.\u201dThat\u2019s a big reason, Barrett and others say, why housing production in Cambridge has taken a significant dip over the past three years. Between 2011 and 2021, builders in the city broke ground on an average of 790 units annually. That number dipped to 491 in 2022, and 404 in 2023. In 2023, developers only finished construction on 39 units, according to city data.Last year was better, with 568 new units started. But 439 of those units were in one project \u2014 a luxury tower in Kendall Square that will soon be the city\u2019s tallest building, part of a bigger development that will also include lab space, while another 106 were approved in a project under special zoning rules allowing for taller buildings on the condition that every unit in them is affordable (such projects are typically financed with public subsidy and don\u2019t include inclusionary units.)AdvertisementOutside of those two projects, the city only started 23 new homes. Only one project \u2014 the Kendall Square tower \u2014 contained inclusionary units.That means developers are mostly building projects that avoid the affordable housing requirement, or that are so large they can offset the cost. Developers have yet to break ground on a 19-unit project on McGrath Highway that was permitted last year with inclusionary units. Still, there is far from universal agreement that the inclusionary policy is to blame for the slowdown, or that it needs to be changed. City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler said he would not support lowering the requirement because it has been the city\u2019s top driver of affordable housing production. Instead, he said, the city could consider creating a sliding scale that ties the share of units required to the size of the building.\u201cThis policy has created thousands of affordable homes for people in our city,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should just drop the requirement because a couple of developers complained.\u201dThat balance \u2014 between affordable housing and sluggish construction \u2014 is a source of debate in communities throughout the region, said Alexis Smith, a principal regional housing and land use planner at MAPC.Somerville, for example, plans to review its inclusionary housing policy, which is also set at 20 percent and drives most affordable housing production in the city. They have heard complaints from developers, too, said Shachter, the director of housing stability, and have seen building slow in recent years. AdvertisementEverett, which over the past decade has seen a building boom on its formerly industrial land, recently increased its inclusionary requirement for projects on polluted parcels from 5 to 10 percent. (Other lots in the city have a 15 percent requirement.) Still, the city managed to generate nearly 700 affordable units between 2017 and mid-2024, said Matt Lattanzi, the city\u2019s director of planning and development.Everett has seen housing construction surge in recent years.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffAnd then there is Boston, where affordable housing math has emerged as an issue in the mayor\u2019s race, after two of the slowest years for new development since 2011. Mayor Michelle Wu last year pushed the requirement from 13 percent to 17 percent with an additional 3 percent set aside for Section 8 voucher holders last year. As in Cambridge, many developers say that has made building more expensive at a time when projects are struggling to pull together financing. Challenger Josh Kraft has proposed dialing back to 13 percent, which he says will unlock stalled projects. The Wu administration says the rise in construction costs and interest rates are responsible for the slowdown, not the inclusionary policy.Related: Amid development slowdown, one city councilor wonders how much affordable housing is too much?Either way, it\u2019s a vexing challenge, said Cambridge City Councilor Patricia Nolan, because it is broad changes in the economy that have really changed the math of building for developers. When Cambridge first studied raising the requirement to 20 percent in 2016, it showed that projects could still pencil out. Now many don\u2019t. The city can\u2019t control the economy, she said, but they can control the affordability requirement. If they want to see more affordable housing built, lowering the policy may be the only effective lever to pull. Nolan filed a policy order last week that proposed the council study altering the affordable housing requirement.\u201c20 percent of zero is still zero,\u201d said Nolan. \u201cI\u2019d rather have some affordable housing than none.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "Reba McEntirehas lit up stages, dominated prime time, and won over generations of fans. Now, she\u2019s bringing her signature spark to a whole new role: helping Americans find a home.\nAs the new face ofRealtor.com\u00ae, the beloved icon stars in a sitcom-style campaign that blends heart, humor, and Southern charm to make the homebuying journey feel a little more joyful\u2014and a lot more human.\nMcEntire, 70, who boasts accomplishments across a wide variety of industries\u2014including music, TV, books, and theater\u2014brings all of those talents to the table and more while starring in a new sitcom-themed campaign, aptly titled \u201cNearly Home.\u201d\nIt is a role that the famed songstress doesn\u2019t take lightly, she explains to Realtor.com on the set of her new campaign, and one that she believes is a very natural fit.\nHomebuying\u201cis not only a serious subject, but it\u2019s also something that is very near and dear to our heart,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople are putting up their hard-earned money, their savings, and they want to find therightplace.\n\u201c[Things like] the backyard, the front yard, the closeness of a school or a church of their choice, all of those things come into play. And if one is not there, it\u2019s like a little piece missing from the puzzle of the pie.\u201d\nHaving spent years touring the globe, performing to sold-out crowds along the way, McEntire knows better than most that home is where the heart is. For her, that place isNashville, TN, a city she has called home for more than 30 years.\nDuring that time, the country legend and actress has created a space where everyone feels at home\u2014whether they are visiting for the first time or the 15th. It\u2019s a talent that she says she learned as a young girl growing up inOklahomawith a mother and father who were endlessly generous with their good old Southern hospitality.\n\u201cWhen people come see me, the first thing I say is: \u2018Are you hungry? Would you like something to drink? When was the last time you ate?\u2019 Now that is Southern hospitality,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI knew growing up that Momma and Daddy couldn\u2019t afford to feed everybody, but if they walked in that front door, Momma asked, \u2018Were they hungry? Would they like something to drink? We have sweet tea, unsweetened tea, whatever you like.\u2019\u201d\nBut McEntire knows that achieving the dream of homeownership isn\u2019t always easy and can, at times, be a downright nightmare. Luckily, she also knows how she can help\u2014by highlighting the ups and downs that are involved in both buying and selling, while also putting a positive spin on the whole process.\nThat is the theme at the heart of the first \u201cepisode\u201d of her \u201cNearly Home\u201d campaign, \u201cThe One Without the Break-Up,\u201d which sees the sitcom veteran lending a helping hand to a couple whose house hunting journey is taking a major toll on their relationship.\nJust as they are reaching their breaking point, McEntire bursts into their living room to rescue them from their nightmare\u2014by revealing how they can use Realtor.com tools to make their hunt so much easier (and more enjoyable).\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s simmer down now,\u201d she tells the desperate duo. \u201cY\u2019all need Realtor.com\u2014the app the pros trust most. With over 500,000 new listings every month, you could find the one today.\u201d\nTough love and Southern charm aren\u2019t the only things that McEntire is bringing to the table. As well as taking on a starring role in the campaign, the singer has lent her iconic vocals to the videos for a charming jingle that is sure to delight her fans.\nSpeaking about her decision to partner with Realtor.com, McEntire explained that the collaboration felt entirely natural, particularly given her own love of looking at house listings.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, this will be fun!'\u201d she says of the moment the campaign was introduced to her. \u201cEspecially when I found out how successfulRealtor.comis. They have over half a million new listings every month! I didn\u2019t know that. And they\u2019ve been in business for over 25 years, so I thought, \u2018They know what they\u2019re doing.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I do like to look at listings. When you\u2019re driving down the road and you see a house for sale, you kind of want to whip in there and see how they\u2019ve decorated it, how that house is \u2026 why would they leave? Although I\u2019m happy with my home, it\u2019s just curiosity.\u201d\nIndeed, her role in the campaign felt so natural that it left her considering whether she might have a hidden talent as a real estate agent\u2014a career path that she feels might be a great fit for her.\n\u201cI do love to go look at houses,\u201d she says. \u201cBut \u2026 I might be a little opinionated and say, \u2018You don\u2019t need this house.\u2019 And maybe that\u2019s what makes a great real estate agent! I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019d be an honest representative.\u201d\nAs for her own life at home? McEntire says much of it revolves around the most popular spot: the kitchen.\nIt\u2019s often the first (and only) place she and her partner,Rex Linn, spend their time\u2014despite her best efforts to enjoy other parts of her house.\n\u201cRex and I both love to cook, we love to host,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut, I mean, you\u2019ve got this house where you\u2019ve got a living room and a kitchen, then a TV room and a game room, and there will be 50 people all in the kitchen.\n\u201cYou can tell them to go and sit down, but they\u2019ll always come back to the kitchen. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s just always been that way.\u201d\nStill, McEntire admits there\u2019s one thing about her home she would love to change if given the chance: its lack of 360-degree views, something that she says is her \u201cdream\u201d as far as the perfect amenity is concerned.\n\u201cI want to be able to see the sunrise and the sunset,\u201d she shares. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have thatyet.\u201d\nLuckily for McEntire, one thing her Nashville property does have that many other homes don\u2019t is the perfect roommate in Linn, whom she readily picks as the person from her life she would choose to live with again and again.\n\u201cWe get along. We love the same television, we love the same foods, we just line up in every subject matter you can talk about,\u201d she explains.\nFor McEntire, this gig as the new face of Realtor.com is about cutting through the noise\u2014and the nonsense.\n\u201cBuying a home should be exciting, not exhausting,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can help folks laugh a little and feel more in control, then I\u2019ve done my job.\u201d\nWith \u201cNearly Home,\u201dRealtor.comisn\u2019t just showing listings\u2014it\u2019s also showing up with a little heart, a lot of help, and one very familiar face.\nTo see the first installment of the\u2018Nearly Home\u2019 campaign, \u2018The One Without the Break-Up,\u2019 head towww.realtor.com/nearlyhome\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "President Donald Trump's trade war is sending construction costs up, and interest rates are expected to stay high this year.",
        "content": "Livestream: Retired Canton police lieutenant takes the stand in Karen Read trial\nBy Rachel Siegel, Washington Post\n\nThe faltering economy is starting to become a drag on the housing market.\n\nReal estate agents, developers, home buyers and economists are all trying to make sense of which way trends are heading. Slower growth \u2013 the economy shrank at the beginning of 2025 \u2013 means interest and mortgage rates will probably stay high for the foreseeable future. Stock market swings and flagging consumer confidence are pushing buyers out of the market. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war is adding thousands to construction costs for new homes and remodels.\n\n\u201cMarkets work because people have price knowledge, and they have those prices to make decisions,\u201d said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. But so much uncertainty, Dietz said, is creating a \u201cwait-and-see economy.\u201d\n\nA house is often a household\u2019s single largest investment or asset, and buying or selling can be one of life\u2019s biggest financial decisions. Entire budgets are structured around monthly mortgage payments or rent. So what happens in the housing market reverberates through the entire economy, and vice versa. Experts look to the number of homes for sale or list prices as litmus tests for how the broader economy is faring. And conversely, housing affordability and availability are among the most direct ways people feel the economy in their daily lives. Keeping a close read on the market is especially key when a range of economic indicators are flashing warnings, but without clear answers as to what they mean.\n\nThere are some encouraging signs. Sales of new homes increased more than 7 percent in March, the highest jumpsince September, with particular gains in the South and Midwest. A brief drop in mortgage rates last month \u2013 spurred partly by a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield \u2013 fueled a flurry of applications for new loans and refinances, as buyers and owners took advantage of the lowest rates in months.\n\nBut something gloomier is taking hold, too. Existing-home sales in March saw their biggest monthly drop in more than two years, falling almost 6 percent during what is normally the spring selling season. Construction spending fell broadly in March. And housing starts \u2013 marking when builders break ground \u2013 fell more than 11 percent, according to government data, with borrowing costs and a tight labor market slowing new construction.\n\nTrump\u2019s global trade war is also stifling builder sentiment after it rallied post-election, according to survey data from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. Sixty percent of builders said their suppliers have already increased or announced increases on materials prices because of tariffs, according to the survey. All told, builders are estimating a typical cost bump of almost $11,000 per home.\n\nRent has also risen for three straight months after cooling late last year, per Apartment List. And home prices keep ticking up, rising 3.9 percent in February, according to data released last week from the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index.\n\nFinally, economists from the Mortgage Bankers Association lowered their estimates for existing and new-home sales in 2025. And they expect just over 1 million single family starts for the next two years.(Experts generally say the United States is short between 2 and 4.5 million homes.)\n\nThe markers are a snapshot of an economy in uncharted territory once again. After the Federal Reserve finally managed to wrestle inflation down from 40-year highs, officials are warning that Trump\u2019s trade war will send prices back up. The latest GDP figures marked the first contraction since early 2022, when the pandemic and supply chain snarls still had a grip on the U.S. economy. Economists and Wall Street analysts are on watch for signs of a recession, especially if employers start pulling back on hiring and investment, or lay people off. Downturns often bleed quickly into the housing market, especially if spikes in unemployment cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.\n\nSome in the housing market have been able to dodge swirling economic forces and stay relatively unscathed. Roughly athird of home purchases were made in cash in 2024, according to Redfin. National home builders have extensive supply chain contracts that cansource materials for lower, fixed costs and dodge wild swings in tariff policy. Builders that cater to wealthier buyers have more cushion to raise their prices.\n\nBut others are caught in the middle.\n\nBill Vallaire and his wife love their five-bedroom home in Prescott, Arizona, that has enough room to host their grandkids. They moved in 2007 and have since refinanced their mortgage rate below a hard-to-leave 3 percent.\n\nBut now, much of Vallaire\u2019s time is spent driving 100 miles south to Phoenix for his wife\u2019s medical care. He has considered selling the house and moving closer to the city to cutthe two-hour journey. But home prices in Phoenix or Scottsdale would probably kick his mortgage payment up from $2,500 to around $9,000 per month. Add the cost of living and homeowner fees, and Vallaire doesn\u2019t think the math would work unless rates slip below 5 percent.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need that big of a house, but until things break on mortgage rates, we\u2019re kind of stuck,\u201d he said.\n\nDietz, of the builders association, said he has been focusing on inflation expectations to fill in a picture of where the market is headed. March survey data from the New York Fed showed households think inflation will rise in the short-term, that their income growth will slow, and that their financial situations and credit access will decline in the year ahead. That could all mean less business for builders as people shy away from major purchases and generally scale back spending.\n\nDietz is alsoconstantly on the road talking to builders seeing price hikes from tariffs, on such things as appliances from Mexico and hardware from China. Canadian lumber has been exempted from some of the latest levies. But that leaves plenty of \u201cthe nuts and bolts used to make a home\u201d subject to steeper costs, he said.\n\nStill, Alan Simonini hasn\u2019t felt much change in the Charlottearea. The luxury home builder said he has had one customer make deposits on light fixtures and low-voltage wiring to get ahead of suppliers\u2019 price increases that started May 1. Beyond that, Simonini plans to carry on as usual.\n\n\u201cI think that all this stuff is going to go away in a few months when everybody comes to the table and creates a new deal with our government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a temporary quarter of price increases. But I really anticipate it\u2019s not going to go up more.\u201d\n\nIn the Washington area, Sam Medvene, president of the DC Association of Realtors, is keeping an eye on what happens to the job market, and whether massive cuts to the federal government spur more people to sell their homes. He thinks the end of September will be telling \u2013 when many federal employees who took buyout offers stop getting paid. Until now, there have generally been more buyers than the number of homes available, putting upward pressure on prices. But that dynamic could flip if there\u2019s an influx of listings later this year.\n\nMedvene said it would be telling to see whether unemployment causes a spike in inventory, so much so that it outpaces demand.\n\nOutside Phoenix, Nate and Margie Sanchez aren\u2019t going anywhere. The couple had been trying to sell their house and move onto a lot with more land. But when they listed their house for $720,000 in January, they felt the market shift, with buyers shying away from homes that rose drastically in value since the pandemic, combined with the strain of high rates. The Sanchezes lowered the price all the way down to $640,000 before deciding to pull it off the market.\n\n\u201cWe had a buyer who wanted a new roof, money toward AC, when we already dropped our house [price] by 60 grand,\u201d Nate Sanchez said. \u201cIt was a tipping point for us to stay where we were at.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

That is one of the higher points of the property,\u201d he said.\nThe main home spans nearly 10,000 square feet and features soaring ceilings, large expanses of glass and organic materials consistent with Wright\u2019s architectural principles.\nA 4,100-square-foot guest residence adds further accommodations, with another 3,400 square feet on its lower level, while a separate caretaker\u2019s house measures roughly 1,980 square feet.\nBut it\u2019s the recreational amenities that have drawn the most attention.\nThe property includes a 34,000-square-foot indoor complex outfitted with a basketball court, a pickleball court, racquetball, a full gym, a massage room, an indoor pool, a hot tub and a sauna.\nSince its debut onZillow Gone Wildlast week, a popular real estate social media account, the listing has amassed more than 3 million views in just 72 hours.\nThe caption read: \u201cMichigan is giving Arizona a run for their money because I have seen a lot of insane mansions there and this one in Ann Arbor is the most blank check mansion we\u2019ve ever seen in Michigan!!\u201d\n\u201cI think that is close to breaking some of the records they have,\u201d Flewelling said.\nOutdoor features are just as elaborate.\nIn addition to a private golf course, a hockey arena, a tennis court and a pavilion, the grounds include a car wash, a greenhouse, a bocce ball court, a playground, a trampoline and a three-story treehouse.\n\u201cThere is a windmill that pumps water up through for the ambiance when you drive in,\u201d Flewelling noted.\nThere\u2019s \u201cprobably about 60 raised beds for flowers, vegetables, all of that.\u201d\nMonaghan founded Domino\u2019s Pizza in 1960 and grew the chain into a global brand before selling the company in 1998.\nThe Ann Arbor estate was one of several personal projects he undertook during and after his time at the helm of the business.\nAdvertisement",

The quaint private alleyway, he said, reminded the \u201cGraham Norton Show\u201d host of London.\nNorton\u2019s residence is one of 10 distinct carriage homes in the Sniffen Court Historic District. The street was initially a collection of horse stables constructed between 1863 and 1864 by John Sniffen. These alleyways, called mews, were vital to pre-industrial life in New York City.\nListing broker Chris Kann of Corcoran told the Times that the landmarked community, located off of East 36th Street near Third Avenue, is \u201cvery European.\u201d\n\u201cPassing through the entry gate you\u2019re immediately drawn to another time,\u201d Kann said. \u201cIt\u2019s by far one of the most charming and picturesque settings one can experience in New York City.\u201d\nNorton\u2019s Romanesque Revival-style pad is located smack dab in the middle of Sniffen Court. The home measures about 20 feet across and spans roughly 2,500 square feet across three floors, plus a 465-square-foot rooftop deck.\n\u201cThere have been lots of parties, big and small, over the years,\u201d Norton told the Times.\nThe listing advertises 15-foot ceilings and a romantic lilac stone fireplace in the home\u2019s great room. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the library nearby, and the formal dining room pops with red-lacquered walls.\nA curving banister leads to the second-floor guest room, topped off by the primary suite on the third floor. The primary includes a separate sitting room, an ensuite bath with a tub, a kitchenette and access to the sun-drenched rooftop deck.\nNorton recently renovated and restored the home with the help of Gachot Studio, with upgrades including central air conditioning, window treatments and custom lighting.\nNorton told the Times that he once considered retiring to the Big Apple, but the London-based entertainer recently put down even more roots across the pond when he married Scottish filmmaker Jono McLeod in 2022.\nNorton\u2019s abode isn\u2019t the only Sniffen Court address with a celebrity past. Musician Lenny Kravitz and composer Cole Porter have also resided along the private street.\nPrevious few residential mews remain in the city, making listings at Sniffen Court, as well as Greenwich Mews in the West Village andSylvan Terracein Washington Heights, a true real estate treat.\nAdvertisement",

Although the chateau evokes European castles, the opulent mansion is just 15 minutes from Birmingham.\nThe chateau, located in the gated residential community of Shoal Creek, reportedly took former MedPartners CEO Larry House more than $30 million and several years to construct.\nFinancial woes led House to part with the home at a major loss in the early 2000s.\nA series of rocky sales and auctions saw the sales price fall away to $4.8 million in 2017, when the palatial home sold at auction to Medical Cloud Computing LLC,Birmingham Business Journalreported. The note was transferred to the company\u2019s founder, Robert Gold, in April 2020 for the same price.\nThe outrageous home reappeared earlier this month for $5 million. Connie Alexander Jacks, of The Luxe Group at The Real Broker, held the listing. The home went under contract on April 28, according to Zillow. The final listing price, and who is paying it, is yet unknown.\nThe Luxe Group could not be reached for comment.\nThe Shoal Creek dwelling boasts a whopping 15 bedrooms and 22 bathrooms, according to the listing.\u00a0The most recent listing photos of the property show a near-empty, cavernous abode.\nThe interiors of the home are covered in gold leaf molding, custom millwork and handpicked marble. The great room features custom-painted murals on the walls and ceiling, accented by a crystal chandelier, with herringbone floors below.\nOther rooms of note include a ballroom, a billiards room, a 2,000-bottle wine cellar and a 25-seat cinema with a ticket booth.\nElsewhere on the property, amid fountains and gardens, is a six-stable barn, a riding arena and a large guesthouse with a two-car garage.\nAdvertisement",

W. Bush from 1989 to 1990, claimed $21 trillion in taxpayer dollars were funneled into the project between 1998 and 2015.\nShe provided no evidence for her claims, but said a 2017 report from Michigan State University economist Mark Skidmore indicated that much \u201cunauthorized spending\u201d had been uncovered across the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development during that time.\nAfter two years of combing through records related to already documented underground military bases, Fitts says she also looked into \u201callegations\u201d of a wider bunker network.\nComparing her research against the missing cash, Fitts said she was able to make a \u201cguess\u201d about how many facilities there really are.\nShe claimed the 170 only applied to bases on US soil and around its coastline \u2013 alleging that more exist across the world.\nAnd the bases are connected by an elaborate transportation system, she added, while claiming they are powered by a secret energy system known only to the military.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that this energy exists. If you look at a lot of the really fast ships, flying around the planet,\u00a0they\u2019re not using\u00a0classical electricity,\u201d she said, in an apparent reference to a spate of bizarre unidentified aerial phenomena supposedly flying around the skies in recent years.\nThose alleged bases are used not just as doomsday bunkers for the elites, Fitts claimed, but also as places for the government to operate \u201csecret\u201d operations like a \u201csecret space program.\u201d\nThe existence of elaborate underground government bases and bunkers is no secret.\nDuring the Cold War, the Cheyenne Mountain Complex was built inside a Colorado mountain to serve as a hardened base of operations for various military operations. It is currently used by the US Space Force.\nAnd from the 1950s through the 1990s, a bunker intended to house all of Congress in the event of a calamity was built and operated in total secrecy beneath the bustling Greenbrier resort in West Virginia.\nFitts, who worked as an investment banker before joining the Bush administration, also floated a number of other outlandish ideas while speaking to Carlson \u2013 including that the COVID-19 vaccine had DNA-modifying ingredients, and that a shadowy global cabal is trying to use mind control to enslave the world, according to the Daily Mail.",

        "content": "Home prices in the Sunshine State saw their biggest decline in more than a decade.\nThe median price for all home types in Florida fell 1.7% in March from the same time last year, according to Redfin, a national real estate brokerage. That\u2019s a small number with big implications.\nBloomberg reportedon the median home price data.\n\u201cThe pandemic rush to Florida is dying down, and with mortgage rates being so high and staying high, it makes it really unaffordable for people paying for those high prices,\u201d Redfin senior economist Sheharyar Bokhari told the outlet.\nAnApril reporton home sales from Redfin identified the slowing pace of home sales across the country, when compared to the pandemic-era buying frenzy.\nEven declines in median sales prices \u2014 one of the biggest declines of which were found in Jacksonville at 3.8% \u2014 aren\u2019t attracting the same enthusiasm. Multiple Florida metros tracked the lowest shares of homes sold above list price in the country, including West Palm Beach at 7.2%, Fort Lauderdale at 8.4% and Miami at 8.5%.\nDeclining in-migration is partly to blame, Bloomberg reported, as some once-eager out-of-state buyers look elsewhere.\nPotential buyers continue to chafe at high mortgage rates and insurance costs, too. Bokhari told the outlet that a lot of the market\u2019s current distress is driven bylackluster condo sales. New upkeep requirements on condos following the fatal Surfside collapse are making units extra difficult to sell.\nMedian prices for condos and co-ops fell about 7% in March, Bloomberg reported, to $307,500.\nInventory in Florida is reaching record highs this year as a result of these manifold pressures.\nWhile some experts point to the recent trends in Florida as a normalization, others aren\u2019t so confident.Nick Gerli, a real estate analyst and CEO of the app Reventure, recently took to X to warn of a significant downtown facing Florida,Newsweek reported. Gerli warned that reduced migration to the state, an oversupply of homes and record high prices could cause an extended decline.\n\u201cThe true reality could be that Florida is now entering the downcycle of inbound migration, and that downcycle will last for years,\u201d Gerli posted. \u201cAnd the only thing that will fix this downcycle in migration, and entice more people to move back, is significantly cheaper prices.\u201d\nWhile the rest of the state is cooling off, however, the Palm Beach real estate marketis on the rise, according to recent Douglas Elliman data. The affluent enclave saw single-family home sales jump by 63.2% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the same period last year. This so-called \u201cTrump bump\u201d following the election is partly fueling the region\u2019s healthy luxury market.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "When it comes to 432 Park Ave., one of Manhattan\u2019s most expensive addresses, the cracks aren\u2019t just in the concrete \u2014 they\u2019re in the trust.\nThe board at the famed Billionaires\u2019 Row supertall is accusing its developers of orchestrating a \u201cdeliberate and far-reaching fraud\u201d by concealing thousands of defects, many of which they claim compromise the building\u2019s structure and safety, according tothe New York Times.\nIn two lawsuits \u2014 onefiled in 2021,the other in April 2025 \u2014 unit owners allege a cover-up that spans nearly a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\u201cThis matter extends beyond negligence into an alleged calculated scheme, driven by greed, that eroded trust,\u201d Terrence Oved, an attorney representing the condo board, told The Post in a statement.\nAt the center of the newest legal complaint is the building\u2019s signature white concrete fa\u00e7ade, a design element that doubles as a load-bearing structure for the 1,396-foot-tall tower, according to the Times.\nThe April lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, claims that developers CIM Group and Macklowe Properties knew the concrete mix would not hold up under pressure but forged ahead with construction anyway \u2014 ignoring internal warnings, failed tests and mounting evidence of structural deficiencies.\n\u201cIt is difficult to know the impact of cracking in a fully loaded building,\u201d Vi\u00f1oly Architects noted in a 2012 field report cited in the filing.\nAlso cited in the suit: Another engineering firm, WSP, echoed the concern and advised developers to \u201chold the pour\u201d until a \u201cvalid\u201d mix was confirmed. Both cautions were allegedly dismissed.\nThe lawsuit claims cracks appeared in nearly every mock-up and persisted well into the construction phase, with more than 1,800 identified by 2016 \u2014 many categorized as \u201clife safety items.\u201d\nProblems ranged from surface blemishes to \u201clarge voids, spalls of unknown origin, unfilled cracks, opened cracks and other serious deficiencies,\u201d the board alleges. Despite four separate consultants being brought in, residents say developers routinely chose cheaper or cosmetic fixes over meaningful repairs.\nThe 432 Park tower opened in 2015 with fanfare and a projected value exceeding $3 billion. Touted as the pinnacle of vertical luxury, the 96-story tower attracted celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and international buyers cloaked behind anonymous shell corporations.\nUnits were marketed as pristine sanctuaries in the sky, with prices ranging from $10 million to $35 million and amenities such as a private restaurant, a pool and a library with a woodburning fireplace.\nBut residents claim life in the clouds has been less than serene.\nBoth lawsuits detail ongoing floods, water infiltration in the sub-basement, malfunctioning elevators, loud noises from trash chutes and severe vibration issues.\nOne resident allegedly had to move out for 19 months during the pandemic due to unremedied noise and construction-related issues.\n\u201cUsing the trash chute sounds \u2018like a bomb,\u2019\u201d unit owners alleged in the 2021 complaint, which also accused the developers of delivering a building \u201criddled with over 1,500 identified construction and design defects to the common elements \u2026 leaving aside the numerous defects within individual units.\u201d\nAmong those alleged defects: sliding doors that don\u2019t shut, fogged-up windows, baseboards detaching from walls and repeated circuit breaker failures.\nThe lawsuits charge that both developers and contractors made fraudulent misrepresentations in filings to the Department of Buildings and state regulators, downplaying or concealing the extent of the damage to avoid costly delays.\nDevelopers deny the allegations.\nIn a statement to the Times, a spokesperson for CIM Group said the firm \u201cvehemently\u201d denies the claims and plans to seek dismissal.\nSLCE Architects, another defendant, issued a similar denial. WSP and Macklowe Properties did not respond to requests for comment.\nEven with the legal cloud overhead, agents say the building hasn\u2019t yet suffered a full-blown pricing collapse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to prove a negative,\u201d broker Jason Haber, who is currently listing a five-bedroom unit on the 55th floor for $29.5 million \u2014 down from $33 million in 2022 \u2014 toldBusiness Insider. \u201cI only know the people who contact me about the building.\u201d\nFor now, the board at 432 Park is seeking at least $165 million in damages in its latest filing, citing not only the repair costs, but also diminished resale value and reputational harm.\nThe city\u2019s Department of Buildings told\u00a0the Times it had not received any notice of \u201cimmediately hazardous conditions\u201d from engineers working at the site.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A team of tech execs has come under fire for allegedly building faulty homes in the Hudson Valley \u2014 or failing to build them at all.\nAccording to three lawsuits \u2014 with five plaintiffs between them \u2014 the tech-based home construction company Welcome Homes took hundreds of thousands of dollars from customers, only to leave them with unfinished and poorly constructed frames or, in at least one instance, a muddy pit. Founded in 2020, Welcome Homes was the brainchild of DigitalOcean founders Alec Hartman and Ben Uretsky, along with Hartman\u2019s brother Marc Hartman.\nNow, plaintiffs in the lawsuitsclaim that Welcome Homesfailed to deliver on its guarantees. All three suits accuse Welcome Homes of fraud.\n\u201cWe were promised a dream home, and all they delivered was a nightmare,\u201d Rena Adams, a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits \u2014 who aimed to trade her Brooklyn townhouse for wide-open spaces for her family upstate \u2014 told The Post.\nWelcome Homes, founded in 2020, aimed to digitize home building, initially offering individual parties brand-new, customized stick-builts in a number of tri-state area locations outside New York City, allowing customers to do everything from purchase land to pick out faucets on its website. It offered a range of home models andpromised to complete themin six months. (While spec houses are often built in about that time, custom homes tend to take an average of 14 months,according to Realtor.com.)\n\u201cThese were millennial tech bros who had relationships with venture capitalists and appeared successful, having taken a cloud-based tech company public,\u201d Adams later added. \u201cThe tech angle and guarantees sucked us in.\u201d\nOriginally headquartered in New York, the Welcome Homes team started with$5.35 million from a seed roundin the summer of 2020. In January 2021,HGTV\u2019s Anthony Carrino, former cohost of \u201cKitchen Cousins,\u201djoined the companyas vice president of design. (Carrino left the company in January 2024 and is not accused of wrongdoing.)\nIn 2021, the company\u2019s six-month assurance was replaced on its website with another promise normally unheard of in home building: a guaranteed price stated in each customer\u2019s signing contract.\nIn one lawsuit, filed in September 2024 with the New York State Supreme Court in upstate Ulster County, plaintiffs Mariam Adams and Rena Adams seek more than $2.8 million in damages. The suit alleges that the founders lured customers into signing contracts to gather proof of concept as part of a broader scheme to secure additional investor funding.\nWelcome Homes closed on a second round of fundingto the tune of $29 millionin September 2022.\nThe Adamses signed a contract with Welcome Homes in July 2022 and gave a deposit of $113,217 for the Oasis 4 Grand model residence. According to court docs, the dwelling was to cost a flat fee of $1,132,179 under the terms of their contract and was to be completed within seven months of the company obtaining a builder\u2019s permit.\nThe 4,600-square-foot four-bedroom home was to be built on a 5-acre property the couple had mortgaged in New Paltz in October 2022. The couple alleged they used a lender recommended by Welcome Homes.\nBut by June 2023, Welcome Homes hadn\u2019t obtained a building permit from the City of New Paltz, prompting the Adamses to apply for and receive one on their own, according to their court filing. That September, work at the site allegedly consisted of overcleared land and a 4-foot hole.\nThe Admases terminated their contract with Welcome Homes in October 2023. The company then billed them for another $212,164, according to a contract amendment obtained by The Post.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe they did $113,000 worth of work, and they claimed they were owed even more money,\u201d said Milad Boddoohi, the Adams\u2019 attorney.\nThe Adamses said they knew nothing about home building in the spring of 2021, when they sought to leave their Brooklyn townhouse and move their two small children to greener pastures upstate.\nHaving both led careers in tech-related fields, the Adamses were attracted to the concept of designing a brand-new home online, and felt secure with the company\u2019s resources, they said.\n\u201cWe were just the perfect candidates for them,\u201d Rena said.\nAdding to its credibility, Welcome Homes partnered with Compass in the spring of 2022. The company\u2019s executive vice president, Benjie Burford, was formerly the national head of sales management at the brokerage, which is not accused of wrongdoing.\nDamages sought by the Adamses would cover the $2.4 million cost of having another contractor build them a smaller, 3,500-square-foot residence on the same property they bought for their Welcome Homes house.\nAfter living in a nearby rental since summer 2022, the couple moved into their finished new house in April.\n\u201cOur new house is beautiful [and] we know that our kids won\u2019t have mold growing in their bathroom or faulty electrical wires in their bedrooms,\u201d Rena said from the dwelling\u2019s new kitchen.\nThat being said, \u201cI won\u2019t ever feel OK about what Welcome Homes did to us and to the other families I talk to who, like us, were ensnared by their promises,\u201d she added.\nAs of press time, a motion from the company to vacate its default was denied by the Ulster County judge overseeing the case. A hearing to determine damages for the Adamses was set for June 18, 2025, though Welcome Homes could file an appeal before that date.\nPlaintiffs in the other lawsuits were given six-month timelines in their contracts, according to their filings. The suits say that after two years, they had partially built homes with numerous problems, including water damage, mold and incorrect grading. Both seek around $500,000 in damages.\nIn one suit, filed in September 2024 with the New York State Supreme Court in Greene County, plaintiffs Erin and William Sloan claim they paid thousands in mortgage loan extensions and roughly $30,000 in interest while waiting for Welcome Homes to complete their house in Windham.\nSubcontractors hired by Welcome Homes installed the wrong windows and placed an electrical box in the incorrect location, then attempted to conceal their mistakes with insulation, according to their court filing.\nThe third case, filed by Angie Wang in August 2024 with the New York State Supreme Court in Ulster County, also seeks $500,000 in damages. Plaintiffs in all three cases allege that Welcome Homes did not provide clear reasons for the delays in their projects.\nA homeowner living in a Welcome Homes house in Westchester County told The Post it also took more than two years for it to be completed, despite a seven-month guarantee in their contract.\nThe homeowner said they eventually managed Welcome Homes\u2019 subcontractors themselves, visiting the site every day to oversee progress. They claimed the house had several problems upon completion, including an incorrectly installed sump pump, which caused the basement to flood.\nHowever, the source said Welcome Homes\u2019 staff is responsive and prompt, and honored their price guarantee along with the warranties stated in their contract. Overall, the homeowner said they enjoy their new house.\nA former company employee, who spoke to The Post anonymously out of fear of retaliation, said Welcome Homes was founded with good intentions, but things went awry when the CEO refused to take advice from construction veterans on staff.\nThe source claimed that during their tenure at Welcome Homes, Hartman failed to fill key roles, specifically a product procurement manager, who is responsible for providing materials to contractors on-site.\nThe CEO wanted plans for new home models so fast that architects couldn\u2019t finish them before moving on to another, the source claimed. Architects also allegedly lacked the time to respond to contractors\u2019 questions about the home plans they were given.\n\u201cIf the professionals are telling them things don\u2019t make sense and they are moving forward despite their recommendations, that is a classic case of fraud,\u201d said Boddoohi, the attorney for the Adams.\nCarrino, of HGTV fame, said Welcome Homes had one customer living in a completed home when he left the company in January 2024, out of dozens of contracts.\nIt was too difficult to convince the Hartman brothers to make significant internal changes, Carrino said of why he left.\n\u201cAlec and Marc Hartman had a direction they wanted to go in,\u201d Carrino told The Post. \u201cIn my 25-plus years\u2019 experience [as a contractor], none of it was best practice in the construction and design industry, so I was no longer able to put my name on that product.\u201d\nA source currently affiliated with the company, who asked to speak anonymously due to the ongoing lawsuits, said most of Welcome Homes\u2019 customers have reported positive experiences.\nThe source said the company\u2019s business plan was designed before COVID caused major delays in the construction industry. The lawsuits are anomalies, each with its own nuances, including changes made that were not covered by their contracts, the source said.\nThe source added that the contracts signed with the plaintiffs couldn\u2019t be used as proof of concept to investors because they weren\u2019t profitable.\nWelcome Homes works with an external product procurement company and has ample systems and staff in place to manage projects, the source said, adding that there\u2019s no intent to deceive customers.\nTo date, Welcome Homes has signed contracts with 45 customers, the source said. The company has completed 18 homes, according to certificates of occupancy reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cWelcome Homes\u2019 industry-leading online home design process delivers unmatched clarity and pricing transparency, enabling more people to build than ever before by reducing months of design and expense,\u201d a spokesperson for Welcome Homes said. \u201cWe remain confident and look forward to addressing these unfounded lawsuits in court.\u201d\nOn its website, Welcome Homes, which has expanded to 10 states, now offers to connect customers with contractors to build the models it provides, and no longer manages home construction. Guaranteed pricing and timelines are no longer offered on the site.\nA spokesperson for Compass said the brokerage is not involved in the allegations made in the lawsuits or Welcome Home\u2019s homebuilding process.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Luxury home buyers inNew York Cityare thinking twice before scooping up a multimillion-dollar property.\nThe Big Apple\u2019s trophy home market has long been resilient, but Manhattan\u2019s is being described as \u201cone area of weakness,\u201d according to theOlshan Luxury Market Report.\nThe trophy market includes properties that are listed at $10 million-plus. In the past four weeks, 12 contracts were signed for properties at that price point. That\u2019s the lowest April level since 2017, when 11 were signed.\nOther parts of theManhattan luxury marketare also seeing a slight dip. Despite a strong week of contract signings over the Easter holiday, there was a slight dip in contract signings in the last week of April. Only 28 contracts in the $4 million-plus range were signed in Manhattan.\nStill, overall, 113 contracts were signed at $4million-plus in New York City. The average asking price was $7,542,857.\n\u201cThe reason for the decline in trophy sales is linked to the wild swings in the stock market,\u201d\u00a0Donna Olshan, president and real estate broker atOlshan Realty, tellsRealtor.com\u00ae. \u201cAt the end of April, the S&P 500 was down 5.3%, but the financial markets looked much worse earlier in the month.\u201d\nDespite the slight dip in April, Olshan adds, \u201cThe\u00a0year-to-date trophy market numbers are fine for 2025.\u201d\nThe No. 1 contract signed for the last full week of April was16 East 64th Street, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It had an asking price of $25 million and was listed in March 2024. It\u2019s now under contract\u2014no word on the accepted price yet.\nThe townhome is 8,700 square feet and six stories high. It includes five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two power rooms, a gym, and, of course, an elevator. The home has a marble staircase, garden, and two terraces offering privacy right in the heart of the Big Apple.\nThe seller originally paid $21.5 million in August 2005 and did a renovation of the property. The annual real estate taxes are $137,643.\nIn April 2025, 450 homes were for sale in the $10 million-plus price range\u2014making up the \u201ctrophy market,\u201d according to data from our Realtor.com economists.\nThere were also 775 listings priced between $5 million and $10 million in April, which spent a median of 82 days on the market. Additionally, there were 3,789 listings on the market priced between $1 million and $5 million in April, which spent a median of 59 days on the market.\n\u201cWidespread economic uncertainty and stock market tumult may be to blame for a slowing ultraluxury market. Buyers looking to purchase a \u2018trophy\u2019 home may be taking a wait-and-see approach instead of jumping into the market,\u201d explains\u00a0Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com. \u201cHomes at this price point must wait for a very specific buyer, which could take months.\u201d\nJones points out that, despite the high price of homes in New York City, the typical home spends just four more days on the market than the national norm.\n\u201cHigh demand for properties in Manhattan keeps the market pace quick and home prices elevated,\u201d says Jones.",

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nBoston\u2019s Zoning Board of Appeals rejected a proposed 70-unit apartment building in South Boston last week, pointing to a lack of parking as a key concern.\nDeveloper Sing Ming Chan\u2019s proposal to erect a nine-story mixed-use building with 70 rental units and ground-level retail at 49 D St., South Boston, was on the table. However, the proposal was missing one key element\u2014parking. The Zoning Board of Appeals took note.\nAt the April 29 meeting, the board voted 5-2 to reject allowing the proposal to move forward. The board then voted unanimously to reject the plans without prejudice, allowing the developer to return with revised plans in less than a year.\nThe Boston Planning Departmentapprovedthe plans without parking in November.\nSitting on the site now is an aging two-story industrial building with surface parking on the proposed site, next to a gas station.\nGeorge Morancy, the developer\u2019s attorney at the meeting, said the initial plans included creating 14 on-site parking spaces underneath the building.\nHowever, after investigating, the developer found that the high water table and soil content would make it prohibitively expensive to build, with estimates at $5 million.\nHe said the project, even without parking, fits the city\u2019s goal of adding more housing near transit hubs, with two Red Line stops nearby. To ease neighbors\u2019 concerns, the developer signed two memoranda of understanding with nearby parking locations for about 90 spots, promising to lease spots to future residents.\nEven so, Morancy said, \u201cWe believe this works well as a no-parking project.\u201d\nThe project included 70 bicycle spots, and a bike lane is out front.\n\u201cAs all our neighbors are fully aware, a very small percentage of new residents regularly use bicycles for travel,\u201d said U.S. Rep Stephen Lynch, in a letter read out loud at the meeting. \u201cThe vast majority of new residents own cars.\u201d\n\u201cFor the city and the ZBA to persist in this fantasy that parking is not necessary is disingenuous,\u201d Lynch continued. \u201cThe homeowners, voters, and taxpayers feel that we are being treated with a lack of respect by Mayor Wu and her administration.\u201d\nThe Andrew Square Civic Association and Cityside Neighborhood Association both opposed the project.\nA representative from the mayor\u2019s office said it received over 150 letters opposing the project and 320 in support. Many said they were not against the project\u2019s density but were concerned about the lack of parking.\nRepresentatives for City Councilors Ed Flynn and Henry Santana also voiced opposition to the project.\nLinda Zablocki, president of the Andrew Square Civic Association, voiced concerns over the developer\u2019s lack of listening to concerns and worried about how rideshare and taxi drop-off zones crossed the bike lane to get to the building.\n\u201cWe are looking for tragedies if this building is approved,\u201d she said.\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Fujifilm North America Corp. in April sold its long-held facility on Crosby Drive in Bedford to a real estate developer planning to convert the building to biomanufacturing uses.GenesisM, a joint venture of Boston-based Bain Capital Real Estate and New York-based real estate developer Botanic Properties, will redevelop the property at 45 Crosby Drive into a 154,000-square-foot facility capable of producing medicines and other therapies. The 15-acre site is at the corner of Crosby Drive and the Middlesex Turnpike just off Route 3. \u201cThis particular location is quite strong,\u201d said Alex Adarichev, principal with Botanic Properties, at a December meeting of the Bedford Planning Board. Biomanfuacturing facilities require highly specialized operations, such as clean room space, which is necessary when making products that go into the human body. AdvertisementA 2024 report from CBRE said that biotech industry shifts toward cell and gene therapies have created a surge in demand for biomanufacturing facilities.\u201cAccommodating the demand is extremely difficult because there is a limited supply to suitable facilities,\u201d the report read. \u201cIncreasingly, companies are simultaneously executing (cell and gene therapy) biomanufacturing and (research and development) activities during the clinical-trial stage, driving demand for leasable biomanufacturing spaces integrated within their R&D operations.\u201d Fujifilm has owned the Bedford property since 2001, when its Microdisks division paid chemical company BASF Corp. $2.4 million to acquire the site. Its successor in April sold the property to an entity managed by Adarichev and Botanic\u2019s Joshua Zinns for $26.35 million, according to Middlesex County property records. The developers intend to redo the building\u2019s facade and realign the building to make it suitable for small- or early-stage biomanufacturing tenants. The property could be divided into as many as six tenant spaces depending on market needs, said Conor Nagle, a landscape architect with VHB, at the December meeting.

        "content": "ByMadeline Bilis\nIf you\u2019re among the thousands of Bostonians moving into a new apartment on Sept. 1, you know that the hunt begins long before that. Not only do abouttwo-thirds of all leasesin the city turn over on this date, but these leases can be signed as early asseven monthsin advance.\nFor those still searching in May and June, the competition likely feels stiff, as renters vie for places with dishwashers and in-unit laundry. But there\u2019s a lesser-known tip that could have you signing on the dotted line much faster: According to Tony DiMarsico, a property manager withCertified Property Managementand broker atNFP Realty, it pays to do a little outreach.\n\u201cAs a property manager myself, I can tell you: We usually know which units will be turning over before anything goes live online,\u201d he toldBoston.com in April. \u201cIn fact, I already have a list of September 1 availabilities that aren\u2019t posted anywhere yet. A quick email or call to a management company can sometimes get you ahead of the pack.\u201d\nBefore reaching out, confirm that the company manages rentals. Not all property management companies handle individual units \u2014 some only manage condo associations or HOAs \u2014 so you should check their website or social media first. \u201cLook for dedicated \u2018rentals\u2019 pages on Instagram and Facebook accounts that showcase available units,\u201d he said.\nOnce you\u2019ve checked, consider starting with a cold email and, if necessary, following up with a phone call. \u201cMost people in property management live in their inboxes, so email is a great first step. If you don\u2019t hear back within a few days, a polite follow-up call can go a long way,\u201d DiMarsico said. At CFP, he adds, their receptionist knows which units are rentals and can forward inquiries to the right people.\nAs for what to write in your email, he recommended keeping it short while also noting your specific needs so they can match you with the right apartment faster. You could try something like:\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m looking for an apartment and wanted to check if you have any upcoming rentals not yet listed. If possible, I\u2019d love to be added to any waitlist or notified when something becomes available. Here\u2019s my contact info and what I\u2019m looking for:\nHere, DiMarsico shared three available units that aren\u2019t listed anywhere yet.\nBedrooms: 2\nBathrooms: 1\nPrice: $4,200 per month\nBedrooms: 3\nBathrooms: 1\nPrice: $4,300 per month\nBedrooms: 3\nBathrooms: 1.5\nPrice: $5,400 per month\nInterested in one of them?

Tamir Ali, 38, jumped on the chance to purchase the 1970s Hawker jet in December 2023.\nThe defunct aircraft is now a quirky Airbnb in northwestern Wales, SWNS reported.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique experience, not many people get to sit in the cockpit of 70\u2019s private jet,\u201d Ali told the outlet.\nAli, who restores classic cars in his spare time, told SWNS that he encountered the investment opportunity through unique connections.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always worked with eccentric people \u2014 people who deal with the weird and wonderful,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI know a chap in Essex, who said he had something that was up my street.\u201d\nThat \u201csomething\u201d was a 1970s Hawker jet, complete with its original cockpit. The aircraft was formerly used through the 1970s and 1980s as a means of transporting employees of an oil company.\nThe Hawker was cut in half and wingless \u2014 for ease of transportation \u2014 when Ali took it off his friend\u2019s hands for an undisclosed sum. He called the plane \u201ca bit worse for wear.\u201d The jet\u2019s nose cone was hanging off, he said, and there was no door.\n\u201cThere was lots of mold and moss inside \u2014 but I immediately envisioned what I wanted it to be,\u201d Ali said.\nAli spent more than $120,000 over the course of seven months to transform the derelict machine into a cozy rental property.\nThe plane is now located in Dolgellau, a charming mountain town in northwestern Wales. It listed on Airbnb just three weeks ago, but it\u2019s already a hit, Ali said.\nAli\u2019s quirky holiday home includes a fully functioning kitchen, a bathroom with a shower and an outdoor sitting area. There\u2019s technically two bedrooms \u2014 a small bed in the cockpit area, and a double bed in the 16-by-9-foot cabin added onto the back of the plane.\nThe renovation process entailed replacing old carpets with wooden floors, rewiring the electrics and getting a custom-made door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome \u2014 when people walk in they say it\u2019s much bigger than it seems on the outside,\u201d Ali said.\nHe named the $227-a-night glamping pod \u201cAlaya Airways,\u201d after his youngest daughter.\nCan\u2019t get enough of the high life? Alaya Airways isn\u2019t the only vintage plane available on the vacation rental site. Airbnb also offers stays aboard a 1956 air freighter in Alaska, a WWII-era plane in Wisconsin, and a Boeing 727 \u2014once owned by Pablo Escobar\u2014 in Bristol.\nAdvertisement",

She flew out with her husband and brother-in-law to collect the deeds, having spent a total of about $25,440 after administrative fees and agency costs.\nDespite the dilapidated conditions, Daniels \u2014 who has worked as a planning consultant for more than 16 years \u2014 felt at ease with the undertaking.\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the idea of transforming things and breaking walls,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFor example, my husband panics when he sees me eyeing up projects like this, but for me it\u2019s just a combination of excitement and joy.\u201d\nThe first property, which was completely collapsed, is now fully renovated.\nIt \u201chas a beautiful marble bedroom,\u201d she said. The restoration cost her approximately $63,600, and she hopes it will require no further work \u201cfor 50 years.\u201d\nHer vision extends beyond family homes.\nOne of the six properties is earmarked as a future wellness retreat offering yoga and meditation classes.\n\u201cIt would be nice to give back to the community this way,\u201d she said.\nDaniels also furnished the properties using local vendors \u2014 installing everything from sinks to flooring sourced nearby.\n\u201cWe wanted to do it with the community in mind,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe love it here \u2014 it\u2019s much nicer than California.\u201d\nWhat drew her to Mussomeli wasn\u2019t just the bargain prices, but the way of life.\n\u201cNobody is rushing around, everything is affordable,\u201d she said. \u201cA coffee and a croissant costs \u20ac1.50. In California, it\u2019s a very stressful environment and everything is so superficial.\u201d\nNow, her two aunts, aged 70 and 82, plan to retire in the hilltop town permanently.\nAnd while her project initially raised eyebrows back home, the once-overlooked Sicilian village has gained international attention.\nAt least 30 people are looking at one home now, she said, explaining how the influx initiative has grown in popularity.\nFor Daniels, the appeal was clear from the start: \u201cYou\u2019re getting the house basically for free and you can turn that into whatever you desire.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

A pergola shelters the outdoor dining area.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that the city is a very hectic place,\u201d Kang told theWall Street Journalin 2022, when the property first hit the market. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of outdoor space where you can just go home, relax and soak in the sun or do outdoor activities.\u201d\nThe Kangs had explored options on the Upper East Side but struggled to find a developer open to creating the kind of outdoor living space they envisioned.\nFlatiron, by contrast, offered the flexibility they needed to bring their vision to life. The building presented a \u201cunique opportunity,\u201d Kang said.\nAccess across the three levels is via a dramatic spiral staircase finished in Venetian plaster and modeled after one at the Edition Hotel near Madison Square Park.\nA custom brass-chain chandelier cascades through the center of the stairwell, adding to the unit\u2019s bespoke detailing.\nThe home, occupying over 6,650 square feet, includes expansive living and dining areas, a kitchen outfitted with hand-blown-glass cabinetry and an office wrapped in walnut with a marble-backed bar, according to one of the listing\u2019s representatives, Leonard Steinberg of Compass.\n\u201cPrivate amenities like your own swimming pool are the jewel in the crown,\u201d Steinberg told The Post.\nThe primary bedroom suite, situated on the top floor, features a Grigio Collemandina marble fireplace, \u201cmassive closets\u201d, and an ensuite bathroom adorned with marble and walnut, the listing states.\nThere is also guest suite wing with its own separate entrance, according to the listing.\nConstruction wrapped in early 2020, just before the onset of the pandemic.\nThe Kangs moved in that February; shortly after, lockdowns swept across the city.\nIt was \u201cperfect timing,\u201d Kang previously told the Journal, noting that their two young children had room to play indoors and outdoors while much of the city wasn\u2019t open.\nNow, with their eldest child attending school on the Upper East Side, the family relocated uptown.\nKang, who serves as chief investment officer of Kylin Management, a fund focused primarily on Asian markets, said the decision to sell was driven by a desire to be closer to school.\nThe listing has made multiple appearances on the market since 2022, originally asking $36 million.\nSteinberg is listing the home with Compass brokers Herve Senequier, Amy Mendizabal, Calli Sarkesh and Niklas Hackstein.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The American dream of homeownership is feeling increasingly like a fantasy for some.\nGallup\u2019s annual housing market survey, released Wednesday, paints a pessimistic picture of the real estate market. Most Americans view current market conditions as decidedly unfavorable,the surveyconcluded, and they are bracing for further price increases in the coming year.\nThe responses of more than 1,000 American adults were included in Gallup\u2019s sample for its annual Economy and Personal Finance survey. The survey measures housing market perceptions and home-buying intentions across the country.\nRoughly one third of respondents reported renting their homes.\nOf that cohort, the percentage for that plan to buy a home within five or 10 years was just 53% \u2014 the lowest ever recorded by Gallup. Also, 45% of respondents don\u2019t expect to buy a home in the foreseeable future.\u00a0More than half said they expect home prices to increase this year.\nThe results come at the same time as widespread economic uncertainty andlackluster spring salesreported by the National Association of Realtors. Home sales in March declined by the most since November 2022.\nThere are plenty of reasons why a renter may not want to become a homeowner \u2014 like convenience, bad credit, an unstable job or just simple timing. But the cost of homeownership, including the down payment, is a bigger home-buying barrier for renters than it has been in the past, the survey revealed.\nOnly 11% of renters cited convenience as their reason for renting, suggesting not renting today is largely an economic choice, rather than a preferential one.\nAmong US adults who currently rent their home, 68% say they do so because they can\u2019t afford to buy or do not have enough money for a down payment. When Gallup asked this question in 2013, just 45% gave this reason.\nAmericans remain broadly skeptical about the housing market, as they have been since 2022, with a majority \u2014 72% \u2014 answering that it\u2019s a bad time to buy a house. But the Gallup data found real divides in perceptions when sorted by region and politics.\nEast Coasters, the survey found, are more likely to expect home prices to rise than other regions. Republicans answered the survey with significantly more optimism than their counterparts \u2014 33% of Republicans surveyed said that now is a good time to buy a home, compared to just 18% last year. This cohort\u2019s expectations for rising home prices also dropped dramatically, from 69% in 2024 to 48% this year.\nDespite declines from their 2022 highs, home prices remain head and shoulders above levels from a decade ago. The financial squeeze of high prices, elevated mortgage rates and an uncertain economy has effectively locked out a segment of Americans from looking forward to homeownership.\nDespite this pessimism, a large proportion of Americans \u2014 37% \u2014 still believe that real estate is the best long-term investment a person can make.\nAdvertisement",

Wear your floaties! Wait! What SPF sunscreen are you wearing?\n\nThose exhortations will be necessary once you occupy this Dedham home \u2014 which is just 20 miles from Boston \u2014 with a 1,300-square-foot in-ground pool located in a fenced backyard that includes a patio and a raised deck.\n\nThe pool is a lovely attraction, but there comes a time for dinner, sleep, school, and the privacy of a first-floor primary suite.\n\nFrom the street, five steps framed by black metal fencing lead to an enclosed portico, which acts as a shield from unpleasant weather. Once inside, the living room is on the right while the dining room is to the left. In between is the stairway to the upper level.\n\n\nTo the right, the 160-square-foot living room is a long rectangle with a double-hung window at the front and a second window on the rear wall with views of the rear raised deck.\n\nFlooring in this room and throughout the house \u2014 except for the kitchen and baths \u2014 is oak, believed to be original to the home.\n\n\nThe 143-square-foot dining room has Nantucket beadboard covering the lower half of the walls. Natural light arrives through three double-hung windows, one on the front exterior and two on the left of the home. There is a central light fixture with a cast-iron appearance.\n\nAbout three-quarters down on the right is a door leading to the distinctive primary suite, where flooring is also hardwood. The bedroom is 190 square feet,has a double-hung window on the front wall, and a large ceiling fan. What makes this space special is the glass sliders that lead to the 102-square-foot private exterior deck. A double closet has bifold doors.\n\n\n\nThe full bath is 170 square feet and has a single white vanity with a light brown granite countertop. The shower/bath combination is behind a curtain and has a granite backsplash. The flooring is ceramic tile.\n\nMoving deeper into the house, a doorway leads to the lower level on the right before landing in the 170-square-foot kitchen. It\u2019s brightened by a skylight and has been updated and decorated in three colors: bold white accents, trim, and cabinets and a shade of blue on the walls amid stainless steel appliances. The quartz countertops also are a shade of blue. The sink is underneath a window above the raised deck. On the left side of the kitchen is a wide, rectangular pass-through to the 130-square-foot family room. This space has an arched ceiling along with a ceiling fan, hardwood flooring, and a line of windows on one exterior wall. Adding natural light is a set of French doors that connect to the raised deck.\n\n\nThe upper level has two bedrooms, both with carpeted flooring. The largest \u2014 at 160 square feet \u2014 on the left of this level has a closet with a bifold door. The 130-square-foot smaller bedroom has a closet with a single door.\n\n\nAccessible to both is the 70-square-foot bathroom with a single vanity that has a white porcelain top. The walk-in shower is an insert behind a curtain. Flooring is the same ceramic tile as the primary bath.\n\nUsing the stairway off the kitchen leads to the lower level, where a chunk is set aside for the home\u2019s mechanical systems and a separate laundry room. But the primary draw is the 360-square foot recreation room with carpeted flooring and recessed lighting.\n\n\nThe pool depth starts at 3 feet and slowly increases to 9 feet, according to the listing agent. The single detached garage has a changing area for swimmers.\n\nThe home has forced hot air by gas heating and central air conditioning. The driveway has parking for four vehicles.\n\nMartin Laird of Coldwell Banker Realtyin Chestnut Hill has the listing. As of press time, an offer had been accepted on the property.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "By Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nIn 2020, just as the pandemic was taking hold, Luke Fraser purchased his first home in Framingham. Its large yard and close proximity to conservation land made it a perfect place to raise his new puppy. Fraser enjoyed spring weekends gathering supplies and working on his outdoor space. It all just seemed like something he was supposed to do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saving to buy a house \u2026 because that\u2019s just a standard you grew up with,\u201d Fraser said.\n\nBut as life returned to a new normal, he missed being close to friends and family in Boston. After a few years, Fraser decided to invert what had seemed automatic and return to renting. It\u2019s a different kind of real estate flip \u2014 one shaped by market factors, family circumstances, or the desire to just loosen one\u2019s foundation for a while.\n\n\u201dI was really going back to the standards in my head of, like, when do you go from buying a house at my age to selling it and renting?\u201d said Fraser, 35, who now rents in Charlestown. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to do, right? You\u2019re supposed to buy the bigger house.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an expectation shared broadly.\n\n\u201cCultural context when it comes to renting versus buying a home is important,\u201d said Rekha Sidhu, 45, who runsa communication agency. A first-generation Indian immigrant, Sidhu was born in England and moved to Boston in 2009. \u200b\u200bShe owned a home in England with her ex-husband, which they eventually rented to tenants after they moved to the United States. In 2020, they purchased a South End condo to get more outdoor space. And through job and relationship changes, Sidhu again chooses to rent, citing flexibility as the higher value feature.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been much happier in the last 15 years of my life as a renter rather than as a homeowner,\u201d Sidhu said.\n\nMost interviewed say they don\u2019t miss the expensive and time-consuming trappings of home ownership. Pricescontinue to rise statewide, andfirst-time home buying is at an all-time low.\n\n\u201cThe money I\u2019m putting into this property every month with my rent, I\u2019m not going to see it come back to me,\u201d Sidhu said. \u201cBut I also am not liable when the shower breaks, or fireplace breaks \u2014 I just have to call my landlord.\u201d\n\nMany former homeowners now renting who spoke with the Globe described high prices driving them to buy farther away from work and family.\n\n\u201cAs the world started opening back up, and [I felt] my social life changing a little bit, I was like, \u2018Wow, I miss being in the thick of it; I miss being around people,\u201d Fraser said.\n\nThe newfound flexibility can be refreshing, offering a clean slate.\n\nDavid Graham, 46, said he married early in life, and prices drove him and his wife to buy in Hubbardston \u2014more than 70 miles west of Boston. But after the marriage ended, Graham rented in Westford\u2014about 35 miles from Boston, where his technical marketing office is located.It\u2019s also served as a convenient place to host his high school- and college-aged daughters when they visit. He now splits his time between Massachusetts and a farm in Ireland \u2014 where his current wife lives \u2014 and is forming plans to relocate there. Meanwhile, renting is offering him some fresh air and solitude in between life stages.\n\n\u201cI kind of look at this as: This is my place to wreck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my place to screw up and to do stupid [stuff]. \u201cIt\u2019s been a space to grow up, right? I think that\u2019s been critical for me.\u201d\n\nTo break the choice down to data points after attending more than 40 open houses, Kevin Vora, 43,who works in finance at Fidelity, builta comparison calculatorsite that projects long-term costs between owning and renting. Vora, who now rents in a Boston suburb with his family, saw owning a home as a poor financial investment compared with stocks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging, because I feel social pressure, and as well as pressure from family and parents, that we should buy a house. \u2026 That\u2019s the measure of success,\u201d Vora said.\n\nHe acknowledged the decision often comes down to more than just financials: The site also offersa toolto consider other factors. And for some, that territory \u2014 one in which stability, independence, and emotions all factor \u2014 is a trickier one to navigate.\n\nMassachusetts has long been a national anchor for academic hiring, but once here, finding housing can still present a big challenge. While a graduate student in Indiana, Zachary Payne,34, purchased a three-bedroom home with half an acre of land for $120,000. After accepting a job here, he sold that home and now rents in Chelmsford \u2014a 30-mile trip to Bostonbut just a 7-mile hop to his job in Billerica.\n\n\u201cBuying here just seems basically not possible on my current salary,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at houses that were the same as mine [in Indiana], basically for four or five times the price.\u201d\n\nAn environmental chemist, Payne said he is concerned about ongoing job security because offederal funding cuts in scientific research.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unsure about my career position as a senior scientist, and I definitely do not want to blow through my savings for a down payment in the near future to purchase a home because of that,\u201d he said.\n\nThough he does not feel threatened by displacement, Payne said something about renting still feels less secure.\n\n\u201cWithout a home, there\u2019s not really any permanence,\u201d he said.\n\nThat feeling can last longer than expected.\n\nIn 2020, Alex Schwartz, 33,and his wife moved from Portland, Ore., to Massachusetts, selling the home they had remodeled. They rented a loft in Easthampton \u2014 a location they thought would be temporary.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "By Catherine Carlock, The Boston Globe\n\nFor 90 years, the brick monastery on the edge of the Arnold Arboretum was home to the Poor Clare Nuns of Boston. Rarely open to anyone outside the cloistered religious order, the three-story property and its surrounding gardens were designed for a life of contemplative prayer. Last May, thenuns moved to Westwood, and it\u2019s been empty for almost a year.\n\nNow city officials, the developer set to buy the monastery, and the abutting Arboretum and those who love it are navigating a tricky balancing act: How to preserve theGothic Revival structure, build much-needed housing, and still protect and preserve the281-acre museum of treesnext door.\n\n\nAfter months of debate, Wellesley-based developer Sixteen Penny Co. \u2014 which has the three-acre site under a purchase agreement \u2014 this winter proposed renovating the existing monastery into 38 affordable senior apartments and putting a new four-story, 85-unit condo building between the monastery itself and the brick wall where the Arboretum starts. In April, city officials sent the project back to the drawing board, asking for changes that would address \u201ccommunity concerns\u201d over shadows and views, a Planning Department spokesperson confirmed.\n\n\u201cStaff have asked the developer to explore design scenarios that would address the community concerns around shadow impact, and view sheds,\u201d Planning Department spokesperson Brittany Comak said in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest example of thedelicate dance requiredwhen balancing the tremendous need for more housing in a dense, historic, and expensive city.\n\n\nCity Hall and the Arboretum agree on the need to build more affordable housing, but are pushing  to do it in a way that protects one of the region\u2019s crown jewels of public space. Developer John Holland, whopartnered with the Poor Clare sistersto relocate their order, has spent years grappling with the site\u2019s sensitivities. He\u2019s eager to build senior apartments but needs a plan that will attract investors, or nothing will be built at all.\n\nHolland and the 920 Centre St. design team have already scaled back. Earlier plans for the project included a five-story condominium between the monastery and the Arboretum, but the design team trimmed the new building down a floor and slimmed its overall size, said architect David Hacin of Hacin + Associates in a March public meeting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to both pull the building back away from the brick wall and to lower the height,\u201d Hacin said. \u201cWe do know there will be some visibility of the project through the trees in the winter months, but I do want to emphasize that it will be considerably below the tree canopy and only seen through the filter of trees that currently exist.\u201d\n\nBut walk along the rear perimeter of the Arboretum \u2014 on a path that may not be official but is certainly well-trod \u2014 and there\u2019s a clear view of the rear of the monastery, which sits atop a hill that slopes steeply downward toward the Arboretum and its Hunnewell visitor center. Even with the scaled-down plans, the design layout as proposed would mean the modern condo building is visible from the Arboretum\u2019s Hunnewell entrance and visitor center. The Arboretum also expressed concern that a construction project \u2014 especially one that included digging for an underground parking garage \u2014 could upset tree roots on their property.\n\n\nThe Arboretum contends that an 18-foot setback violates existing zoning laws \u2014 particularly the city\u2019s Greenbelt Protection Overlay District, which aim \u201cto enhance and protect the natural scenic resources of the city,\u201dper Boston\u2019s zoning code. They\u2019ve tapped their own architecture firm \u2014 Atelier Ten \u2014 to create renderings of the project, as viewed from the Arboretum\u2019s property.\n\nWhile development disputes between neighbors can get quite testy, the disagreement between the Arboretum and the development team is marked by a sense of respect and civility. William \u201cNed\u201d Friedman, the Arboretum\u2018s director and a Harvard University biology professor, emphasized the \u201cthoroughly professional and respectful and transparent\u201d conversations and noted that the development team has shared data and other studies so Arboretum leadership could seek out other opinions.\n\nBut to the Arboretum \u2014 where nearly 3,000 of the 16,000 trees belong to species that are threatened with extinction \u2014 nearly any threat can feel existential.\n\n\u201cThis is something that will loom over our living collection,\u201d Friedman said at a recent public meeting. \u201cEverything about this historic landmark has to be thought through exceedingly carefully. \u2026 Being able to grow trees that are healthy and robust, especially in a world with changing climate, is incredibly important.\u201d\n\n\nInan April 9 letterfiled to the Boston Planning Department, Holland said his team would work closely with the Arboretum in developing alternative plans, which it will file in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the importance of the Arnold Arboretum as a valuable community asset and a significant historical landscape. We are committed to carefully considering the potential visual impacts of our development,\u201d Holland wrote. \u201cWe firmly believe that the 920 Centre Street redevelopment will not adversely affect the health of the Arboretum\u2018s trees, a position supported by scientific and biological evidence.\u201d\n\nThe letter shared the results of studies that examine the amount of shadow projected to be cast by a certain building during specific times of the year. The Arboretum, which has used data from the development team to pursue its own shadow studies, contends that at some points \u2014 particularly in late summer \u2014 there could be as much as 4 hours of new shadows cast over plants from the rear of the monastery across to the Arborway.\n\nIn Boston, state law manages the amount of shadow that can be cast on the Public Garden and Boston Common \u2014 though not on the rest of the Emerald Necklace park system. Karen Mauney-Brodek, the president of the nonprofit Emerald Necklace Conservancy, said a wave of development on areas surrounding the Emerald Necklace highlights the need for more specific city policy governing sunshine and shadows over ecologically sensitive areas.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to highlight the totality of a potential shadow problem when discussing development on a project-by-project basis, Mauney-Brodek said, especially when the state is facing such a housing shortage.\n\n\u201cWe have to balance all of these things, and parks and open space are losing,\u201d Mauney-Brodek said. \u201cPolicy is desperately needed. \u2026 It feels very haphazard, right now, what\u2019s allowed in one place and not another.\u201d\n\nAs part of its agreement to develop a large-scale mixed-use project on Simmons University\u2019s Fenway residential campus \u2014 which abuts the Emerald Necklace \u2014 Swedish building giant Skanska in late 2022 agreed to a $1 million donation to study shadow impacts on the park system. And the citylast year launched a $400,000 studyof light and shadow on the Back Bay Fens and Riverway Parks, which is expected to wrap up later this year.\n\n\nChris Vaughan, a member of the JP YIMBY \u2014 or, \u201cYes In My Backyard\u201d \u2014 coalition, said the benefit of more housing outweighs concerns over shadows.\n\n\u201cI think this project would provide more people access to the Arboretum, which is the absolute crown jewel of the neighborhood,\u201d he said.\n\nFor its part, the Arboretum intends to complete its own shadow studies, Friedman said \u2014 studies that will be shared with Holland and the 920 Centre St. development team.\n\n\u201cEvery tree here has a story. Every tree here has a purpose,\u201d Friedman said at the March public meeting. \u201cThese are museum objects that we have been working for 153 years to share with the public.\u201d\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nOne of my earliest memories of a garden occurred in northern Germany at the home of my maternal grandmother, Renate. With a mischievous twinkle in her eye, she invited me to join her on a \u201cschneckenjagd\u201d or slug hunt, a summer evening routine where the two of us, armed with trowels, a metal pail, and flashlights, stalked the garden beds for shimmery quarry.\n\nI remember a feeling of satisfied accomplishment when the bucket was emptied into the compost pile, knowing the garden was safe, for at least that night, from marauding mollusks. Renate also introduced me to the joys of red currants and gooseberries, two impossibly tart fruits to my young taste buds, magically transformed into the most delicious jam I had ever tasted.\n\nMy mother, Freia, exposed me to the sweet abandon of eating nectar from honeysuckle blossoms, to the intoxicating scent of lily of the valley, and to the nearly Sisyphean task of raking sweetgum fruits from the lawn in autumn. I met the mother of my children while working at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden 19 years ago. All three of these strong women have imparted experience, wisdom, and a love for the natural world that has shaped and informed my career path.\n\nAs I gain a bit more life experience every year, I grow increasingly grateful for those early memories and the effect they have had on me. For that, I am deeply thankful. It is no wonder that Mother\u2019s Day is so closely associated with flowers, the spring season, and gardens. The very act of caring for plants is a nurturing, fulfilling, and compassionate activity. Here are some great ways to share your love of flowers, gardens, and family.\n\nFlowers are a symbol of love and appreciation, a language unto themselves. Learn to speak that language at the many garden destinations throughout Greater Boston. Celebrate the joys of youth as embodied at theArnold Arboretumin Boston and its world-famous lilac collection. Boasting 173 different kinds of lilacs, totaling more than 400 shrubs, you will be awash in pastel colors and adrift in the delirious fragrance of this stunning garden. Be sure to wander the rest of the arboretum grounds to take in the splendors of this iconic Boston garden.\n\nThe historicMount Auburn Cemeteryin Cambridge is offering aMemories of Mothersguided tour with knowledgable docents, highlighting the symbols of motherhood on monuments. The towering trees and peaceful space at Mount Auburn are truly special.\n\nTheHeritage Museum & Gardensis opening for the season this weekend and offering mothers free admission on Sunday. These gardens feature an amazing collection of rhododendrons and hydrangeas, well worth the trip to Sandwich.\n\nFor our Maine-based readers, theCoastal Maine Botanical Gardensin Boothbay is offering free admission to all moms this weekend, too. The native butterfly house, award-winning children\u2019s garden, and garden troll exhibit are sure to delight.\n\nFor our Metrowest families, I can recommend theNew England Botanic Garden at Tower Hillin Boylston. The apple orchard will be in full bloom, and the conservatories feature stunning collections of tropical plants, including sumptuous orchids. There is so much to discover!\n\nLastly, consider bringing the family toNative Plant Trust\u2019sGarden in the Woods in Framingham. Easy walking trails will welcome you throughout our 45 acres as you take in the fresh new leaves on the trees and the carpets of native spring wildflowers, all while being serenaded by songbirds.\n\nWherever you spend this weekend, I hope you spend it with family and friends, in honor of the women in your lives, celebrating life, love, and mother nature.\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Maria Silva is used to being the only woman in the building \u2014 she\u2019s been a \u201cdoorwoman\u201d in New York City for more than two decades.\nIndeed, her position is supremely rare in the Big Apple, which has long had residential buildings staffed by doormen.\nAs that name implies, the position is most commonly held by men, whose crucial duties run the gamut from safeguarding parcels, vetting guests and responding to the occasional headache \u2014 lockouts, broken elevators and the like. They also form a strong part of any building\u2019s community.\nHowever, women make up just 3% of this iconic New York City job, according to union demographics, making doorwomen more rare than female taxi drivers, at 6%, or female MTA employees, at 13%.\nThis small cohort, sources told The Post, has to work extra hard to get their foot in the door \u2014 and work extra hard to keep it there.\n\u201cThere are times that you will get a guest coming in requesting to see an apartment or the leasing office, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, wow, there\u2019s a woman here,\u2019\u201d Silva said. \u201cOnce in a while you get those. It doesn\u2019t bother me, though.\u201d\nDespite being the odd man \u2014 or woman \u2014 out, there is nothing else Silva would rather do. The 53-year-old grandmother claims to know each resident in her 250-unit rental building in Brooklyn, where she is the only female employee out of 10. She\u2019s worked at the building, under the \u201cLead Concierge\u201d title, for nine years this summer.\n\u201cI know everyone,\u201d Silva said. \u201cTheir friends, their parents, cousins, everything. Dogs, too.\u201d\nSilva joked that she sometimes feels more like a therapist or a bartender than a doorwoman, she gets to know the residents that well.\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m the first one to learn when one of the girls are pregnant, or they\u2019ll invite me to their weddings,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThose are special moments.\u201d\nSilva has received two wedding invites so far this year, and the kids\u2019 birthday invites are a near constant. She said the five or six pregnancies in her building each year are always cause of celebration, too.\nOne of her residents recently shared the happy news with her \u2014 but secretly, Silva already knew.\n\u201cAs soon as I saw that little bump!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so sweet, they come in and show me the sonograms, we talk about if it\u2019s a girl or a boy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to land a union-wage doorman gig in the Big Apple. Job vacancies are rare and it\u2019s widely reported that you have to know a guy \u2014 who knows a guy \u2014 to find one. If this industry is notoriously hard to break into for your average Joe, it\u2019s even harder for your average Jane.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for a female to get the job,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt is a male-dominated field, and to be a female in the position, you have to have thick skin.\u201d\nSilva said she\u2019s been asked by hiring managers about her ability to show up for work on time as a mother, or later, whether she\u2019d take extra sick days as a grandmother.\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s the reason why they don\u2019t like to hire women. They\u2019d rather hire a man, because they are more respected than women in that sense,\u201d Silva said.\nLike Silva, Yaphia Pabon believes that being a woman makes her an even better doorman, though she prefers \u201cdoor lady.\u201d\nPabon got her gig on the Upper East Side eight years ago. She recalled walking through the city with her friends and saying something along the lines of, \u201cWow, I would love to see a door lady.\u201d\n\u201cMy girlfriend was like, \u2018You should look into that\u2019,\u201d Pabon said.\nPabon was working in payables and receivables at a hospital at the time; staring at a screen all day hurt her eyes. The active and social demands of this new profession suited her much better.\nEight years later, Pabon is occasionally relied upon by her female residents to zip up dresses and cast the deciding vote on which shoes to wear for a night out at the ballet. It\u2019s a special level of trust she gets as the only woman working at the door of her 30-unit condobuilding. She also serves as her building\u2019s porter some days.\u00a0That role is far more athletic than that of a doorman \u2014 mopping the floors, taking out the garbage at night, wiping the windows to name some necessary tasks.\nPabon said that while she has felt unfairly singled out by past male colleagues, the hardest part of the job is, in fact, the heavy lifting. New Yorkers create a lot of garbage, and she\u2019s always hauling it outside.\n\u201cPeople will walk by and say, \u2018woman power,'\u201d Pabon said, laughing.\nShe was on porter duty recently when the 5-year-old daughter of a family that moved out recognized Pabon across the street.\n\u201cI was outside doing my job, and I saw her tugging on her nanny, saying she wanted to go across the street,\u201d Pabon said. \u201cWhen they came up, she hugged me so much. She was like\u00a0 \u2018I miss you so much. There\u2019s no door ladies at my new building!\u2019\u201d\nThe New York City doorman is a true institution of the city. The stereotypical capped, coated, silver-haired and white-gloved doorman represents a stalwart barrier from the chaotic city streets, a discrete confidant, a watchful friend.\nThe doorman profession is far older than New York City, however. Ancient Roman doormen, called \u201cianitors,\u201d inspired an Ovid poem about a locked-out lover begging an unyielding ianitor for entry.\nAndrew Alpern, an architect and architecture historian, described the modern profession as one in evolution \u2014 from spending all day hailing taxi cabs in the pre-smartphone era to now navigating hoards of Amazon packages. The demographics of the profession have also evolved.\n\u201cWhen I was a child, doormen were almost always Irish. They were the largest immigrant group when I was growing up in the 1940s. Today, of course, other immigrant groups have come in,\u201d Alpern said. \u201cAnd, if I\u2019m to believe [reports], women have become doormen.\u201d\nSharon Noel Lake ticks both boxes \u2014 the mother of two immigrated from Trinidad in the late \u201990s and, even after 20 years in the business, remains the only woman working in her ultra-luxury condo building on Billionaires\u2019 Row.\nAlthough Lake demurred from naming her workplace \u2014 its near-celebrity status in the world of New York real estate \u2014 she called it \u201cluxury of luxury.\u201d Discretion, Lake said, is the key to her job.\n\u201cWe are like the gate keepers, and there is a lot that goes on,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day this is their home. I treat it very private, like if it was my home.\u201d\nWhile her official title is that of concierge, Lake said she wears multiple hats on any given day \u2014 runner, greeter or doorman. She is also her building\u2019s shop steward for 32BJ SEIU, which represents workers in the building services industry across several states.\n\u201cA lot of people ask me, why I don\u2019t go for property manager, why I don\u2019t go for something else?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I love what I do, and I think if I leave, I wouldn\u2019t be able to help my colleagues the way I do.\u201d\nThe 32BJ SEIU union represents 28,000 doormen in New York City, the union told The Post, including 800 women.\nSilva, Pabon and Lake all said that women in this line of work have to look out for themselves.\n\u201cI just learned that I had to stand on my 10 toes,\u201d Pabon said. \u201cAnd say my opinions a lot.\u201d\nShe described a previous boss frequently singling her out for critique, or male colleagues poking fun at her for reorganizing delivery boxes after they stacked them poorly.\n\u201cThey always say, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s giving it the female touch,'\u201d she said.\nBeyond the typical ribbing, Pabon acknowledged that she has to keep her wits about her to stay safe outside during her late night porter duties. But, she said, the night shift looks out for each other.\nLake, the only woman on her crew of more than 30 employees, runs a tight ship, but said she had to earn the respect she now commands.\n\u201cBeing a woman in this position, it is hard,\u201d Lake said. \u201cI had my ups and downs, and I had to work hard for my respect. I always use the phrase, \u2018Don\u2019t let the tone of this voice fool you.'\u201d\nFor Silva, though, the relationships she gets to have with residents make up for it all.\nHer favorite shift will always be the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. slot, she said, because she gets to see all the kids she has come to know so well come home from school.\nSilva recently received a wedding invitation from a resident she\u2019s known for eight years. She won\u2019t attend \u2014 she doesn\u2019t like to mix her work with her personal life \u2014 but she\u2019ll always accept a slice of birthday cake when it\u2019s brought down to her desk.\nThe Christmas tips don\u2019t hurt, either.\n\u201cThe main reason why I\u2019m still there, it\u2019s because there\u2019s love from the residents,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt makes it feel like home.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Years on, and stronger, she has a glass-half-full perspective on the tragedy.\nDuring a recent Q&A at her \u201cSomething Beautiful\u201d event in New York, the pop singer described the destruction of her Malibu compound in the 2018 Woolsey Fire as a turning point.\nThe $2.52 million property, which included a four-bedroom residence and her personal recording studio, Rainbowland, was reduced to ash just weeks before she married Aussie actor Liam Hemsworth.\n\u201cWhen my house burned down, that was the biggest blessing I\u2019ve ever had in my life, actually,\u201d Cyrus said, according toPeople.\n\u201cLosing everything and being able to rebuild, and to be able to be purposeful and choose every piece that I\u2019m gonna collect \u2014 or also just about the people in my life.\u201d\nThe 2-acre estate wasn\u2019t just a home. It was the birthplace of her recording career, where Cyrus, then a teen, laid down tracks for her first album in 2005.\nBut the fire brought more than physical loss.\n\u201cA lot of my relationships also burned down,\u201d she said. \u201cThat again just led me to such magic and to have so much gratitude.\u201d\nCyrus and Hemsworth had spent nearly a decade in an on-and-off relationship before marrying in December 2018. By August 2019, they had separated, and their divorce was finalized in early 2020.\nAt the time of the fire, Cyrus was filming Netflix\u2019s popular \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d in South Africa.\nShe recalled receiving the news while strapped to a gurney, in costume for her character Ashley O.\n\u201cActually as my house was burning down I was strapped to a gurney with my hands locked in handcuffs strapped to a bed,\u201d she shared onTikTokin 2023.\nThe following day, she was on set again filming a dance-heavy music video. \u201cThe show must go on,\u201d she said.\nLooking back, she said she would have told her younger self to embrace the difficult times.\n\u201cThey are only leading you into the light.\u201d\nCyrus, who stepped back from touring in 2023, is now preparing to release her ninth studio album, \u201cSomething Beautiful,\u201d on May 30.\nThe project will be accompanied by a visual film premiering June 6 at the Tribeca Film Festival. One of the album\u2019s eight producers is Maxx Morando, drummer for the band Lilly, whom Cyrus began dating in 2021.\n\u201cThis album has to start with me loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether you know it or not, it\u2019s gonna be coming through the speakers when you\u2019re listening.\u201d\nHemsworth, 35, has since entered a quieter chapter.\nHe began dating Australian model Gabriella Brooks in late 2019, though the couple didn\u2019t appear publicly together until the following year.\nBrooks made her runway debut at Australia Fashion Week in 2023. Cue fashion brand director Kate Bielenberg called her \u201csuch a great girl\u201d and praised her as the embodiment of \u201ccool girl vibes.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

(The sellers, Sabrina and former Goldman Sachs managing director Ramsey Smith, bought the residence for $3.2 million in 2014.)\nBuilt in 1860, the former Methodist church stands on the corner of Washington Square Park. It was dubbed the Peace Church\u00a0because of its support for Vietnam War protesters \u2014 and it also supported the Black Panthers and GMHC, formerly known as the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis.\nWhen Law lived in the penthouse during a stint on Broadway\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d in 2009, he worked out with his trainer on the terrace, much to the delight of his neighbors in an NYU freshman dorm. But the teenage fun turned when Lawthrew oranges at them.\nThese days, the building is more subdued.\nAn elevator landing opens directly into a large living area overlooking an original stained-glass centerpiece.\nThe spacious loft boasts two separate entertaining spaces connected by a 6-foot-wide, 41-foot-long central gallery with a wall of stained-glass windows that is an ideal spot to showcase art.\nThere\u2019s also a windowed skylight, and an open chef\u2019s kitchen.\n\u201cThe building only has eight homes, and no two are alike. But even among the others, this one really stands out. For instance, the stained glass that begins on the second floor appears from the floor to the ceiling on the third level,\u201d said Serhant\u2019s Krista Nickols, who shares the listing with Serhant\u2019s Peyton Yen and Jake Dunsmore.\n\u201cThis home is ideal for someone who wants something that no one else has, and appreciates its character, originality and craftsmanship,\u201d Nickols said.\nThe main bedroom features a charming bay window, a separate dressing room with a walk-in closet and an ensuite spa-like bathroom, which also boasts stained-glass details.\n\u201cWe have so many happy memories of raising our family there \u2014 playing in Washington Square Park and being right in the heart of Greenwich Village,\u201d Sabrina Smith told Gimme Shelter.\n\u201cIt was such a unique experience. Even though we\u2019ve moved out of New York, the building will always have a special place in our hearts,\u201d Smith said.\nThe church\u00a0converted to eight condos in 2006.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Looks like this unassuming beach enclave is flexing its mussels.\nOnce a modest fishing town known for its snowbird retirees, Naples, Florida has quietly reinvented itself as one of America\u2019s most exclusive communities.\nWith its mix of Gulf-front mansions, cultural appeal and low-profile opulence, the city is drawing a steady tide of billionaires \u2014 and earning comparisons to Palm Beach in the process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quiet enclave of luxury living,\u201d Naples-based luxury realtor PJ Smith told theDaily Mail. \u201cThe famous, uber-wealthy live in Naples under the radar and they love it.\u201d\nOver the past few years, Naples has experienced a wave of record-setting real estate deals.\nBillionaire businessman David Hoffmann recently purchased an $85 million mansion originally built for a private owner.\nBut that transaction was eclipsed by a $225 million off-market sale involving a 15-acre compound with three separate estates \u2014 a new high watermark for Florida\u2019s housing market.\nIn February 2024, a 17,000-plus-square-foot estate situated on 5 acres was listed for $295 million, earning the title as the most expensive home in America at the time. But in January, the price of the home was reduced to $210 million, where it still remains on the market.\nAs ultra-high-net-worth individuals continue to descend on the Gulf Coast, Naples has gained a reputation as the go-to destination for those seeking both glamour and anonymity.\nIn 2024,U.S. News & World Reportnamed it the top place to live in the country, describing it as the \u201cpreferred retirement spot for the rich, powerful and cold-averse.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very culturally interesting place, but it\u2019s also very under the radar,\u201d Angela Lutzi Dellator\u00e8, a Naples luxury estate agent, told Daily Mail. \u201cThe whole world is your oyster right here.\u201d\nHigh-profile names such as Judge Judy Sheindlin, Best Buy founder Richard Schulze and Papa John\u2019s creator John Schnatter have all settled in the area.\nThe city\u2019s most elite neighborhoods \u2014 Port Royal, Park Shore, Pelican Bay and Grey Oaks \u2014 feature private docks, beachfront access and championship golf courses.\nGated communities with tailored concierge services offer privacy, safety and ease of living for those who prefer to delegate the logistics of daily life.\nDellator\u00e8 noted that Naples appeals to the ultra-wealthy because of its understated elegance.\n\u201cThere are so many wealthy people that live here and they choose Naples because nobody pays attention,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very casual atmosphere.\u201d\nEven casual comes with a price tag.\nHelicopter pads, members-only clubs, and waterfront estates are increasingly common. The downtown area has seen a boom in luxury development, including the debut of the high-rise Ascent at Metropolitan Naples, where apartments overlook the Gulf.\nNaples also offers lifestyle perks beyond real estate.\nThe city is a designated \u201cBlue Zone,\u201d recognized for its high concentration of centenarians.\nResidents prioritize health-conscious living, aided by restaurants and stores like Seed to Table that emphasize chemical-free produce.\n\u201cNaples has been very much involved in trying to help people understand how they can live a long and healthy life,\u201d said Dellator\u00e8.\nCultural offerings such as Artis\u2013Naples and the Naples Philharmonic provide entertainment, while activities like boating, golf, tennis and pickleball cater to the city\u2019s active, affluent crowd.\n\u201cBoat slightly north and you have restaurants and shopping and museums and there\u2019s a fine arts center that has Broadway plays,\u201d said Dellator\u00e8. \u201cIt\u2019s a very culturally interesting place.\u201d\nWhile markets in other parts of Florida \u2014 like Miami \u2014 face slowing sales, price cuts and high deal cancellation rates, Naples remains buoyant.\n\u201cThe collapse in demand in Miami\u2019s housing market is breathtaking,\u201d wrote Nick Gerli, CEO of real estate analytics firm Reventure App, on X.\nIn contrast, Naples continues to attract cash-rich buyers undeterred by volatility elsewhere.\nWhether it\u2019s the flip-flops-and-lunch crowd or those flying private to Europe, Naples has carved out a unique niche.\nAs Dellator\u00e8 put it, \u201cThe reason that people are drawn to this area has so much to do with the downtown area being right by the waterside.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

Now, the 8,000-square-foot building, which has been converted into a private residence, is on the market for $3.85 million.\nKnown as the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church for over 100 years, 279 Main Street is now a six-bed, four-bath single-family residence tucked on a corner lot in the center of Groton. Constructed in 1887, it was originally used as the first chapel for the Groton School, and later moved to its current site on horse-drawn rollers.\nDan and Marilyn Schwartz, the owners of the property, purchased it when it was dilapidated and lovingly restored it. She visited the Groton School archives to gather information on the property and purchased books of FDR\u2019s letters to his parents, which featured comments discussing his love of the chapel.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make the former church your home, you can step inside the large front door to a vestibule with two double doors. Continue into the grand hall, the church\u2019s former nave featuring towering wood ceilings and stained glass windows. The 1,225-square-foot space has a\u00a0cozy fireplace, while the choir loft above maintains its architectural grandeur.\nA kitchen features a large center island, stainless steel appliances, and plenty of counter space. Behind the kitchen, you\u2019ll find steps that lead up to the lofted bedroom under the half-barrel ceiling. It measures 432 square feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a Harry Potter vibe,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cAnything that we had that was provided or left, that had an architectural vibe, we kept and used.\u201d\nBack downstairs, to the left of the kitchen, is a door that leads down a hallway to the former sacristy, which is now the primary bedroom area. There\u2019s a half-barrel ceiling and a large stained glass window, as well as French doors that lead outside. A private bath is spacious and features a dressing area.\nA major addition includes the sprawling 619-square-foot dining room off the grand hall, where black-and-white checkered white marble and black granite flooring, and several sets of French doors that stream in natural light. It leads out to a 672-square-foot deck.\nA four-car garage was also added. Above the garage, there\u2019s a 2,000-square-foot apartment that could be rented out. In the lower level, you\u2019ll find another 2,000 square feet of additional living space with a kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, and its own entrance.\n\u201cWe built it as a multigenerational home,\u201d said Schwartz, who is hoping to relocate to a warmer climate.\nWhile the home is not being sold furnished, Schwartz is open to negotiations.\nJeff Gordonof EXIT Assurance Realty has thelisting.\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "This property is offering a license to chill.\nA French Riviera estate once owned by the late Sean Connery, the original James Bond, has returned to the market with an asking price of approximately $26.4 million, according to a release from the brokerage Savills, which listed the property this week.\nSet on a terraced hillside in Nice, the Art Deco residence \u2014 formally known as Villa Roc Fleuri \u2014 is better known in the area as the \u201cBond Villa,\u201d Chuck McKee of Savills said in a statement.\nConnery, who played Bond in seven films, resided there in the 1970s and \u201980s.\nOverlooking the port of Nice and Cap d\u2019Antibes, the villa occupies a prime spot at the foot of Mont Boron and neighbors the famed Ch\u00e2teau de l\u2019Anglais, an architectural landmark.\n\u201cIt arguably has the most spectacular view in Nice,\u201d says the release.\nBuilt in 1930, the property spans more than 10,000 square feet and retains original details throughout, including mosaic inlays, ceiling moldings, wood paneling, wrought-iron banisters and even the building\u2019s original elevator cabin.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom layout includes a top-floor primary suite with dual en-suite bathrooms and access to panoramic terraces.\nExtensive outdoor features include a rooftop entertaining deck with a built-in barbecue, manicured lawns and a network of garden pathways \u2014 one leading directly to the rocky shoreline below.\nA spa area, complete with a gym and an indoor/outdoor heated infinity pool, offers dramatic sea views.\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s overflowing into the sea,\u201d McKee toldMansion Global, which picked up news of the listing this week, of the infinity pool.\nIn addition to the main villa, the property includes a separate caretaker\u2019s residence and a guesthouse near the entrance, currently divided into two apartments.\nThe current owners, whose identities have not been disclosed, purchased the home in 2015 and have since carried out a full renovation.\nThey\u2019ve \u201coverhauled everything,\u201d McKee said, noting upgrades to the central heating and cooling systems, bathrooms and landscaping.\nWhile the home is being reintroduced at $26.4 million, it was previously listed in late 2020 for roughly $33.8 million.\nConnery, who passed away in 2020, also owned another property in the region: Domaine de Terre Blanche, a ch\u00e2teau in Tourrettes, which he bought in 1979 and later sold to billionaire Dietmar Hopp. That property was ultimately converted into a luxury resort.\nAdvertisement",

Not everyone was a fan of its bold new look. The marble-clad mansion, which features Panda marble floors and gold-clad toilets, caused quite a stir online.\nThe Instagram accountIG Mansionshared photos of the home to a barrage of comments,House Beautiful reported.\n\u201cA giant box of tacky\u201d and \u201cTacky AF\u201d were variations on a similar refrain. Some commenters even poked fun at Stamos: \u201cDamn, Uncle Jessie and the Rippers made a lot more money than we thought,\u201d one commenter wrote.\nThe Instagram carousel amassed nearly 900 opinionated comments, including one from Stamos himself. The 61-year-old actor chimed in on IG Mansion\u2019s post last week.\n\u201cIn my defense, I sold that house many years ago and it has been \u2018redecorated,\u2019\u201d Stamos wrote.

The 8,147-square-foot property has changed hands more than once since then. Justin Aguilera, a one-time Republican congressional hopeful, and his wife, Candace, bought the home in 2020.\nThe couple maintained Stamos\u2019 Mediterranean facade but reimagined the interiors with the inspiration of \u201cGreat Gatsby at night,\u201d the property\u2019s broker, Compass\u2019 Alessandro Corona, previously told The Post.\n\u201cThe interior has been entirely transformed to this new white, black and gold, shiny, gaudy masterpiece,\u201d Alessandro told The Post.\nThe Aguileras\u2019 maximalist vision included rare Panda marble floors, fireplaces, walls and countertops, as well as plentiful gold accents \u2014 including toilets \u2014 and crystal chandeliers.

Mennella, a retired automotive warranty executive, and his wife, Dolores, who purchased the empty parcel from Joel in 2018 for $7.5 million.\nThough they lived in the home for several years, the Mennellas tell The Journal they always saw the project as an investment.\nThe couple has a track record of flipping trophy properties in Manalapan, having sold a nearby estate last year for about $48 million, according to public records.\nTheir latest effort blurs the line between private residence and five-star resort.\nDesigned with the scale and amenities of a luxury hotel, the three-story home includes five bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, multiple bars, a spa wing with massage and steam rooms, a bowling alley, a movie theater, a 1,000-bottle wine cellar and even a craft room.\nOne of the property\u2019s most distinctive features is a private tunnel under State Road A1A, connecting the main house to a beachfront cabana spanning roughly 1,200 square feet.\nLike other estates in Manalapan, the property enjoys frontage on both the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 a dual-coastline setup that\u2019s become one of the area\u2019s defining, and most valuable, traits.\nListing agents Philip Lyle Smith and Carla Ferreira-Smith of Luxury Resort Portfolio said the home is being sold fully furnished, including much of its art collection.\nManalapan, home to fewer than 500 residents, has seen a surge in ultra-luxury demand since the onset of the pandemic.\nProperty values have more than doubled in some cases, buoyed by record-breaking deals like Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison\u2019s $173 million purchase of a historic estate in 2022 and a $285 million ask on a new spec mansion currently in the works.\nAs for the Mennellas?

Her father,\u00a0Arthur Dollison, was the associate and also acting warden.\nWith her parents and her two older siblings, Babyak first lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Building 64, an old military barracks.\nThe bottom portion of the building dated back to the 1860s, and the top (where they lived) was finished in 1906. Babyak and her sister,Corinne(who passed away in 2016), shared one large bedroom, while her brother got an \u201cunlighted hallway.\u201d\nThe island had a small general store and a post office but not much else. There wasn\u2019t a hospital or medical clinic.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get hurt,\u201d was the advice the kids got.\nBabyak, who today is one of the island\u2019s premier historians and has written several books about the prison, once fell and hit her head.\nA \u201cminimally trained\u201d medical technician monitored her for a concussion, but that was all for medical care.\n\u201cIf it was really serious, like you were bleeding out, you\u2019d have to go to the city,\u201d she says.\nThis required catching a ferry, which ran frequently from a dock on the island.\nAs a second grader in the 1950s, Babyak was sent into the city by herself for school.\n\u201cDifferent times,\u201d she says, laughing.\nShe and other kids from the island would take the ferry and then a bus to their school, and back again.\nNo telephones on the island could reach the city, so once she left for the day, she was essentially on her own \u2014 with a few older kids to make sure she got around OK.\nClassmates knew she lived on the notorious island.\n\u201cThey were fascinated,\u201d she says. \u201cThey mostly wanted to know about\u00a0Al Capone, who was dead by then. I got the feeling they thought that the kids and prisoners all ate dinner together at one long table.\u201d\nShe remembers a childhood full of adults who were \u201cvery actively involved\u201d in their kids\u2019 lives \u2014 constantly putting on events, parties, dances, \u201cwatermelon feeds,\u201d and performances to keep the young ones occupied and out of trouble.\nWhile they all played on a large playground in the middle of the island, adults were constantly monitoring them, either keeping watch from the surrounding homes\u2019 windows or as the men walked past while going to and from prison work shifts.\nAs a teen, Babyak enjoyed her first kiss after an island \u201cbeatnik\u201d-themed party with another teen resident. (They are Facebook friends today.)\n\u201cWe had this life on a prison island that was ideal,\u201d she says.\nShe notes that this is the exact opposite of the childhood most of the prisoners had, and why they ended up where they did.\n\u201cThey were throwaway kids,\u201d she says. \u201cThe product of trauma.\u201d\nAs an adult, she realized that the prisoners weren\u2019t there because of their supposed terrible crimes but because of their anti-social behavior in other prisons\u2014and that most were mentally ill.\nDespite growing up always being told that her prisoner neighbors were the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d offenders, Babyak is adamant that she was never frightened of them. One prisoner even handed her a stray ball through a fence.\n\u201cHe must have gotten permission from a guard,\u201d she says.\nLater on, other prisoners told her they had enjoyed listening to the sound of children playing, that it brought a bit of sunshine and normalcy to their lives.\nOthers, however, said they felt sorry for the kids, imagining them to be \u201ctrapped\u201d on the island.\nBabyak was living in a nicer duplex house on the island in 1962, when the island\u2019s most infamous escape happened. She was asleep when an alarm jolted her awake.\n\u201cMy mother met me on the stairs, and she said, \u2018Get dressed, there\u2019s been an escape, we have to search the house,'\u201d she says.\nShe and her mother,\u00a0Evelyn, had to go down to the basement to see if the three escapees were hiding out there.\n\u201cThat part was a little scary,\u201d she says, though her mother told her in all likelihood the men had already gotten off the island.\nThe escapees were three bank robbers,\u00a0John Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin. Their ingenious escape involved putting papier-mache\u00a0model heads resembling their own heads into their beds, breaking out of the prison via ventilation ducts, and fleeing aboard an improvised inflatable raft.\nWhile it assumed they all drowned, their bodies were never found, leaving open the possibility that the trio enjoyed freedom for the rest of their lives. But Babyak doubts this.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have food or money and two had never been to San Francisco before.

        "subhead": "After Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost was selected to become the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, offers began flooding in to buy this modest house outside Chicago, the real estate broker said.",
        "content": "By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Debra Kamin, New York Times Service\n\nReal estate prices jump for a lot of reasons: location, the market, even a shiny new kitchen. But one humble house in Chicago could have sticker shock thanks to being the childhood home of the first American pope. Call it a papal price bump.\n\nMoments after white smoke emerged from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel to signal the selection of a new pope, the price on a modest brick house in Dolton, Illinois, 30 minutes south of downtown Chicago, went up. How much is still to be decided, but the world discovered that Pope Leo XIV once lived in the humble house on 141st Place.\n\nOffers began flooding in to Steve Budzik, a real estate broker who had fielded a handful of offers in recent months for the house that he originally listed for $199,000. The owner has pulled it off the market as the two evaluate the potential windfall, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when Pope Leo XIV, who was then Robert Prevost, lived in the home, but his father owned it from before Robert\u2019s birth in 1955 until selling it in 1996, when the future pope was working in Peru.\n\n\nBudzik said he was thrilled by the swell in interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d Budzik said when he answered the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be the broker to represent the seller who owns the pope\u2019s childhood home.\u201d\n\nHe said he found out that the house was connected to Leo when a reporter called him on Thursday, and that he thought it was a joke at first. Then, they got eight or nine offers for the home in rapid succession, some offering above the asking price.\n\nThe seller, he said, told him to pull the house off the market so that they can learn more about Robert Prevost\u2019s time there, including what room he slept in and what the interior looked like before it was renovated. They are considering returning the home to the original floor plan, Budzik said. He said he hoped to get the input of the pope\u2019s older brother, who lives nearby.\n\n\nBudzik said he had sold homes ranging from $77,000 to $1.25 million, but that now there was no comparison to working with this property.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored,\u201d he said. \u201cWow, this is amazing. This is exciting.\u201d\n\nEven without its famous former resident in Vatican City, the three-bedroom, two-bath house is set could draw a tidy profit for the current owner: The home was purchased for just $66,000 in 2024, according to property records. The average home price in Dolton, a community of about 20,000 people just south of Chicago, is $150,000, according to data from Zillow.com.\n\nCelebrity connections alone can\u2019t guarantee the value of a house. Sometimes, homes with famous former residents see price swings in both directions. The Tudor-style house in Queens, where President Donald Trump spent the first four years of his life, was purchased in 2014 by a cash buyer for $2.14 million. But it then fell into disrepair, and in March, was sold for just $835,000.\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

You can\u2019t overprice in this market,\u201d said current listing broker Thomas Hochfelder, of Douglas Elliman.\nThe Siegels gained international attentionwith the constructionof their 90,000-square-foot Orlando, Fla., home, known as Versailles. Construction began 21 years ago. It was chronicled in the 2012 award-winning documentary \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d which is slated to be a Broadway play starring Kristin Chenoweth.\nThat home is still slated to be the country\u2019s largest when it is finally completed \u2014 but construction was stymied over the years by economic troubles and natural disasters. It is estimated to be worth around $100 million when finished.\nIn April, David, the billionaire founder of Westgate Resorts \u2014 the world\u2019s largest privately owned timeshare company \u2014 died before they could call Versailles home. He was 89 years old. Days later, Jackie\u2019s sister Jessica Mallery died of an overdose after taking cocaine laced with fentanyl. She was 43 years old.\nIn interviews, Jackie has said she will use Versailles to hold charity events, \u201cgive back\u201d and raise awareness about drug addiction. It\u2019s the best way, she said in interviews, to cope with the pain of loss.

It\u2019s the crown jewel of a landmarked, turn-of-the-century Beaux-Arts building.\nThe home opens to a foyer that leads to a great room with living and dining areas that showcase city skyline views.\nThe city views continue in the main bedroom suite, which also boasts custom walk-ins and a spa-like marble bath with radiant floors.\nThere are also two additional bedrooms and a home office and laundry room. Design details include custom herringbone floors and high ceilings.\nAn open chef\u2019s kitchen \u2014 \u201cwith a 20-foot-long marble countertop,\u201d Hochfelder noted \u2014 features a sculptural marble staircase that leads to an 850-square-foot landscaped terrace with a summer kitchen,\u00a0lights and speakers,\u00a0along with an interior service bar and powder room.\nThe home is primed for entertaining, Jackie told Gimme when the home first hit the market \u2014 including hosting events for Victoria\u2019s Voice.\nThe limestone and granite building, once the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, dates to the early 1900s. It was added to the National Historic Registry in 1982 \u2014 and converted to condos in 2013. The building\u2019s original \u201cgrand banking hall\u201d is now an immersive art space, Hall des Lumi\u00e8res, which hosts art exhibitions with music, plus yoga classes.\nBuilding amenities for residents include a landscaped rooftop park with sun decks, indoor/outdoor kitchens, a 50-foot lap pool and a gym.\nAdvertisement",

Berkus is best known for his appearances on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show,\u201d and later \u201cThe Nate Berkus Show.\u201d\n\u201cAt The Katharine, our goal was to honor the building\u2019s storied past and preserve its historic charm, while also ensuring the new homes meet the lifestyle needs of today\u2019s buyers,\u201d Berkus said in an email to The Post. \u201cEach of the eight residences spans a full floor and offers a highly versatile layout.\u201d\nThe pre-war building was built for the Ladies Christian Union in 1930 by architect Benjamin Wistar Morris, known for the Union League Club and the opulent Cunard Building. For decades, the Katharine House served as a form of independent housing for thoroughly modern women pursuing education and jobs. It was one of the last such women\u2019s homes in the city when it closed its doors in 2000.\nThe layout of the residence \u2014 partitioned, modest sleeping quarters above and wide-open parlor rooms below \u2014 later served the building as dormitories for the New School.\nBKSK architect Julie Nelson told The Post that the landmarked building was hollowed out when the firm began the project in 2021. Bay windows, stairs and stripped brick walls were all the remained of the building\u2019s original bones, she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something really exciting about giving new life to these buildings, and particularly this one which has such an interesting social history, based on the aspirations of women coming to the city,\u201d Nelson said.\nThe U-shape around the building\u2019s courtyard allowed for an impressive number of exposures and private bedroom wings, Nelson added, giving every resident a connection to the back garden.\nBerkus selected the floor plan layouts, finishes and decor, and personally advised on architectural decisions, according to a spokesperson.\nBerkus, a longtime Greenwich Village resident, told The Post that the chance to work on a historic building in the heart of the village was \u201can instant yes.\u201d The aim of the design, he said, was to make the Katharine feel timeless.\n\u201cWe were deliberate in what we removed to open up the interiors, allowing the energy of the tree-lined street to flow into each of the eight full-floor homes, and creating a strong connection to the historic brick fa\u00e7ade and the bay windows at the rear of the building,\u201d Berkus said.\n\u201cThe spaciousness of each home and functionality is something I think anyone with a family like me will love and appreciate,\u201d Berkus, a father of two, added.\nSales as the Katharine launched this spring under Compass. Two units, both above $10 million, are currently under contract, according to StreetEasy.\nAdvertisement",

Originally known as the Cabot-Endicott-Low House, the Georgian-style home with Colonial Revival-style alterations was constructed in 1744 for\u00a0shipping merchant Joseph Cabot.\nStep inside the original front doors to a grand scene straight out of the 18th century.\n\u201cYou\u2019re greeted by one of the most beautiful high Georgian entrance halls in the Northeast,\u201d saidMichael Selbstof Gibson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who has thelisting.\nA 10-foot wide hallway runs the depth of the house under 11-foot ceilings, while a fluted and turned staircase cascades upward, filled with its original balusters. At the top of the stairs is a large Palladian window that lights both the upper and lower hallways. Back at the front door, a right turn brings you into a billiards room. To the left is the living room, which features original paneling, floral wallpaper, and a fireplace.\nA large dining room with a golden stone fireplace surrounded by 18th-century paneling is a beautiful entertainment space with lots of natural light and a large bowed end wall with three windows along the curve offering different views of the garden.

        "content": "Karen Read trial canceled today due to health reasons, court official says\nBy Diane Bair, Pamela Wright, The Boston Globe\n\nWhat measures 30,000 square feet, makes a thwack-thwack sound, and is coming to the Seaport this summer? That would be Ballers, a new social-and-sports concept featuring outdoor pickleball and padel courts, a bar and caf\u00e9 with a noted chef, and community events like tournaments and theme nights. Come winter, the plan is to convert the pickleball courts to an ice rink. (Heaters and hot toddies should keep things comfy.) Courts and social spaces will be open to all.\n\nSet to launch in mid-July, Ballers is backed by several pro-athlete investors, including tennis stars Kim Clijsters, Sloane Stephens, and Andre Agassi (now apickle baller), along with pickleball champ Connor Garnett and NBA All-StarTyrese Maxey. Ballers will open its first location in Philadelphia in mid-June, followed by Boston. The company aims to open 50-plus locations in the United States in the next seven to 10 years.\n\nWhy Boston? \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic sports city,\u201d says founder and CEO David Gutstadt. Can\u2019t argue with that. The idea is to connect people through sports and social experiences via the fast-growing racquet sports industry, he says. \u201cWe want to bring people together around the love of sports in an urban setting.\u201d\n\nWith top-of-the-line courts and upscale amenities, Ballers is looking to create a private club experience in the city, but with no membership required. (Well, unless you want one; two-tiered monthly memberships will be offered that include free open play, advanced booking ability, and discounts on court time, lessons, food and beverage, and retail merch.)\n\nThe Boston venue will offer three padel courts \u2014 the first ones in Boston \u2014 designed for year-round play, and five pickleball courts. (The pickleball courts will transform into an ice rink with a synthetic surface in winter.) The pickleball- or padel- curious are welcome; Ballers will offer lessons for both sports, along with open play, meaning you can join a group on a court.\n\nOriginating in Mexico, padel is played on a court enclosed by glass walls. Typically played in doubles, using a racquet and a tennis ball, it\u2019s is a fast-paced game. \u201cPadel is harder to master than pickleball,\u201d says Gutstadt, a former college tennis player who is now \u201cobsessed\u201d with padel.\n\nPadel is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. According to the International Padel Federation, padel is now played by around 25 million people across the globe, and is hugely popular in Mexico, Argentina, and Spain. FIP estimates there are courts in more than 90 countries.\n\n\nAnd the pickleball boom hasn\u2019t started to sour. \u201cYoung people are discovering the sport. Kids are starting to play in schools \u2014 you\u2019ve got a brand-new wave of people coming into the sport,\u201d Gutstadt says.\n\nAccording to theSports, Fitness, and Leisure Activities Topline Participation Report, 19.8 million Americans played pickleball last year. Pickleball participation has grown 311 percent in the last three years, according to the report, with an average player age of 34.8.\n\nPost-play eating and drinking will be part of the scene, of course. When Ballers opens in July, beverages will be available, including beer, wine, and hard seltzers. About a month later, they\u2019ll open an outdoor caf\u00e9 (under a shaded pergola) in partnership with James Beard Award semi-finalist chef Mitch Prensky of Supper Philly, L\u2019Ecole, and Lutece. What will they serve? \u201cSomething local,\u201d Gutstadt says.\n\nThe cost to play each sport will range from $15 to $30 per hour. 45 Pier 4 Blvd., Boston;www.ballers-us.com.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "Nearly everyone agrees that perhaps the biggest threat to Massachusetts\u2019 economy is that people \u2014 and particularly young people \u2014 are moving away because housing is so expensive here.But if so many people are moving away, why don\u2018t housing prices go down?The state\u2019s combination of slow population growth and sky-high prices would seem to contradict the basic laws of supply and demand.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysThe simplest explanation is this: Even if people leave the state, Massachusetts is so short on homes that it would still need to build more to house those who stay.There is no true estimate of exactly how many homes Massachusetts needs to meet demand right now, because different economists have different ways of measuring these things.So researchers tend to defer to the most obvious indicator: the state of the housing market. Greater Boston has for years had among the lowest rental and homeowner vacancy rates in the country \u2014 a measure of the region\u2018s extreme demand, and a major factor in why prices and rents only ever seem to go up.Advertisement\u201cThere is no one perfect measure of the housing shortage,\u201d said Daniel McCue, a senior research associate at Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies. \u201cThe easiest thing to look at is the housing market and the way prices are growing here. That is indicative of extreme demand that the state isn\u2018t meeting.\u201dOne recent example: In many parts of the country, home prices have modestly dipped over the last two years due to rising interest rates. Not here. Statewide, single-family home prices rose 11 percent in 2024, according to real estate analytics firm The Warren Group. In other words, the state has such a significant shortage that the housing market here defies national trends. AdvertisementThat alone, said McCue, is enough of an indicator that the state needs to build more, much more.And then there\u2019s the broader picture of the state\u2019s population trends.Related: People are still leaving Massachusetts, but the exodus is slowing down | Chesto Means BusinessMuch of the narrative around people leaving Massachusetts focuses on what\u2019s known as domestic migration \u2014 people moving from one state to another. And it is true that roughly 27,500 people left Massachusetts for elsewhere in the US in 2024. But it\u2019s also true that 90,000 people moved here from other countries \u2014 the other piece of the migration equation \u2014 for a net gain of about 63,000. That may have been something of an aberration due to a surge in international migration to the US in 2023 and 2024 \u2014 the highest level the state has seen in the 21st century \u2014 that is expected to slow down now under President Trump.But immigration has driven population growth here for some time. Domestic migration was negative well before COVID \u2014 every year going back to 2014 \u2014 while international immigration has been positive. Then there are births in the state, which have outpaced deaths here for years, though that growth has slowed recently. So while people are leaving the Massachusetts, the population is still growing.And on top of the number of people who live in the state is the number of households they form. That number is also expected to grow over the next ten years, said McCue. Related: These Massachusetts maps show where median home prices have risen (and fallen) the mostAdvertisementSomeone forms a new household when they move into a new living arrangement. The simplest example of this is when a young person moves out of their parents\u2019 home, and what was one household becomes two.Household growth has surged in the US in recent years \u2014 driven mostly by Millennials \u2014 and the same has been true in Massachusetts. Between 2025 and 2035, the state figures some 500,000 Millennial and Gen Z residents will form new households here, exceeding the pace at which Baby Boomer and other older households shrink or move away. A condo development under construction in Jamaica Plain.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffThe easiest way to think of that dynamic and how it impacts the housing market in Massachusetts is like this: Picture a couple who raised two children in a Boston suburb. Eventually, those children will move out on their own, forming new households of their own that require housing. Most won\u2018t find any place to live in the town they grow up, unless that town has built new housing. At the same time, their parents will still be living in the house they grew up in, now with empty bedrooms, because there are so few smaller options.What this dynamic means is that the number of people who need housing in Massachusetts will keep growing, even if the overall population does not.Those are the new households the Healey administration accounted for when it called on the state to build 222,000 new homes between 2025 and 2035. The researchers who helped create that recommendation assumed zero population growth; if they\u2019re wrong, of course, the state will need even more.AdvertisementOne somewhat common refrain is that population loss wouldn\u2018t be such a bad thing for Massachusetts, because it could lower housing costs. Why is it such a bad thing if the kids move away from the town they grew up in, or even out of the state, if it means demand for new homes will go down? The answer, said McCue, is that those kids are future workers, who power the state\u2019s companies and economy. If they leave, good jobs will follow. Housing costs would drop because of a downturn in the state\u2019s economy marked by job loss, companies leaving the state, and a generally weaker Massachusetts. \u201cThat is not a scenario that anyone should be rooting for,\u201d said McCue. \u201cStates with healthy economies don\u2018t shrink.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "ByClaudie Bellanger\nNew Englanders are no strangers to the Cape Cod-style house. The classic architecture can be found across the country, but you\u2019ll find it most abundantly along the coast of New England.\n\u201cCapes are indicative of the history of who we are in New England,\u201d said Mike Tartamella, managing principal atPatrick Ahearn Architect, a Boston- and Martha\u2019s Vineyard-based architecture firm that often works on Cape-style houses. \u201cIt speaks to the Yankee mentality of being minimal to start, and then as you need more, you grow.\u201d\nThe easily recognizable Cape Cod-style house uses simplicity to its advantage for timeless charm. Typically, this style house is a symmetrical rectangular shape, with a steep roof, a central chimney, and a central front door. The style best suits a one-story home, but second floors are common (considered one-and-a-half-stories) \u2014 though they\u2019re often slightly smaller with sloping walls due to its steep roof.\nA defining feature of a Cape-style house is the side-gabled roof, meaning the slopes of the roof face the home\u2019s front and back, and the gables are on either side. This roof style allows snow and rain to easily slide off, so it\u2019s fitting in colder climates like New England.\nBorn out of the traditional English cottage, early New England settlers adapted the Cape Cod-style house to combat harsh winters. The side-gabled roof, low ceilings, central chimney, and small size of the homes all combat weather conditions and conserve heat efficiently.\nIn 1800, president of Yale College Timothy Dwight IV coined the name \u201cCape Cod House\u201d for the popular style in his book,Travels in New England and New York, after he saw the house style in Yarmouth.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not typically over-the-top or showy, but it\u2019s a really understated type of architecture that was baked more out of necessity,\u201d Tartamella said. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t building homes to show how big they could build a house \u2014 it\u2019s the antithesis of the opulent era of the Newport mansions. It\u2019s more modest,\u201d he said.\nOne of the oldest houses in the region,the Atwood-Higgins house, is a Cape-style house that was built in the 1730s on a remote road in Wellfleet.\nIn the classic edition of Monopoly, Cape Cod-style houses may have been the key to your success (or downfall). According toRealtor.com, the plastic green houses that are bought to raise taxes on properties are based on Cape Cod-style houses.\n\u201cRenovating Capes is always exciting,\u201d Tartamella said. \u201cCapes have always been known as being very easy to add to, and they offer a lot of expandability.\u201d\nCommon renovations include opening up the ceiling, adding dormers or additions, and taking down walls for open floor plans. For many, the goal is preserving the classic architecture while creating additional space for a more modern living experience.\nWhile a full-Cape is the classic style, there are other variations of Cape homes that ditch the symmetry:\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn said in a statement that it will \u201ctransform Clippership Drive into a legitimate destination for our region.\u201d\nTheplansinclude 283 apartment homes across two buildings, with 56 units designated as affordable housing, deed-restricted at 80% of the area median income.\nPlans also include a 13,500-square-foot grocery store to address a need identified in the city\u2019s 2023 Comprehensive Plan. At the Clippership Drive and Riverside Avenue intersection, a 2,500-square-foot local caf\u00e9 and community gathering space will activate the streetscape.\nParking improvements include a 273-space garage and 567 parking spots \u2014 184 more than currently available \u2014 through the restoration and redesign of existing public lots.\nThe project also includes a partnership with Beyond Walls to curate public art installations and emphasizes pedestrian- and bike-friendly infrastructure, including enhanced crosswalks and safer streets.\nFurther changes to the proposal and the negotiation of a final land lease and agreement will occur over the next several months. The final agreement will then go before the City Council for consideration and approval.\nTransom Real Estate\u2019s proposal calls for construction to start in the second half of next year, with a grand opening expected in September 2028.\nTransom Real Estate\u2019s previous work includes the Converse World Headquarters at Lovejoy Wharf, the residences at The Beverly in North Station, and 212 Stuart Street in Bay Village. The city chose the firm through a request for a proposal.\n\u201cThe redevelopment of the site is a once-in-a-generation chance to energize the existing neighborhood and usher in the next stage of progression,\u201d Transom staff wrote in the RFP submission.\nWork to transform this majorcity intersection began several years ago, when the Metropolitan Area Planning Council engaged with the community to determine its priorities. The2017 Medford Square Master Planinformed the scope and direction ofthe request for proposal.\nThe city\u2019s development goals included supporting local businesses in Medford Square with new residents, upgrading parking options for the Senior Center, and attracting regional visitors to places like the Chevalier Theater.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that this proposal is just that, a starting point and a potential look at what the space is capable of,\u201d Mayor Lungo-Koehn said. \u201cThere is work to be done before shovels hit the ground, and the community will be involved every step of the way.\u201d\n\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "The historic structure on the intersection of Third Street and Third Avenue in Gowanus, Brooklyn sticks out like a \u201cstone\u201d thumb.\nThe Coignet Stone Company Building, newly on sale for $2.99 million, is the earliest known concrete building in New York City. It was constructed in the 1870s as a functional advertisement for its proprietors, the New York & Long Island Coignet Stone Company, with the very same patented cement stone the company was desperately trying to sell to New Yorkers.\nThe business did not survive the test of time, but their showroom \u2014 slash everlasting billboard of sorts \u2014 did.\nThe building\u2019s broker, Erica Nieves of Corcoran, described the building\u2019s current condition as \u201craw.\u201d\n\u201cIt definitely needs some TLC,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a person who knows the history of this, that knows that Gowanus is an artsy neighborhood, then you can see the potential.\u201d\nThe former showcase structure spans 2,360 square feet across three levels, and boasts some of the details expected of the city\u2019s pre-war gems \u2014 soaring 13-foot ceilings, arched windows, a curving staircase and cornices.\n\u201cI\u2019ve passed this building for decades upon decades, and I know that a lot of people in the neighborhood have been vying for this building just to be restored,\u201d Nieves said. And, indeed, that\u2019s the experience of many \u2014 as the Gowanus Whole Foods Market very visibly hugs this historic structure that stands right on the corner. The thoroughfare is also a bridge between trendy Gowanus and quaint Carroll Gardens, meaning the building has long received hordes of passersby who regard it as a local landmark.\nThe Coignet Agglomerate Company of the United States was founded in 1869, according toa Brownstoner timeline of its history. Construction on its all-concrete offices and showroom began in 1872. The bright white stone was a stark departure from the borough\u2019s typical brick and brownstone facades.\nThe business, then renamed the New York and Long Island Coignet Stone Company, filed for bankruptcy a short time later, in 1873. The building changed hands numerous times \u2014 and got an unfortunate makeover with brick cladding \u2014 before abandonment in the 1960s.\nThe Coignet Stone Company Building\u2019s current owner acquired it in 1992, according to city records. Attempted sales in 2013 for $3 million and in 2019 for $5 million were unsuccessful.\nAlthough the exterior gota total, white-washed refreshin 2016, thanks to a pledge from its neighbor Whole Foods, the interior looks every bit the abandoned warehouse.\nThe landmarked building\u2019s zoning changed as recently as yesterday, according to Nieves. Instead of a mixed-use property, the building now only allows for businesses, like a restaurant, office or retailer.\nThe current sale coincides with an offer to lease the property, Nieves said.\n\u201cEverybody, for decades, has gone by this building and wondered what\u2019s inside,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cSo to have a company take it over, whether it\u2019s a restaurant, a shop where people can actually tour the space, would be phenomenal.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

So much so that the Rochester, New York area emerged as one of the most competitive real estate markets in the country this spring.\nAccording to new data from theNational Association of Realtors, Monroe County \u2014 where Rochester stands \u2014 ranked fifth nationwide in March for market \u201chotness,\u201d a measure that blends buyer demand with housing supply indicators, such as time on market and online listing activity.\nAmong more than 1,600 US counties analyzed, it was the highest-performing in New York State by a wide margin.\nSeveral other upstate pockets also landed in the national top 100, including Broome County, which covers Binghamton, at No. 23 \u2014 and Livingston County, home to towns like Geneseo in the Finger Lakes region, at No. 27.\nNearby Ontario and Tompkins counties \u2014 anchored by Canandaigua and Ithaca, respectively \u2014 also posted strong showings, alongside Tioga County near the Pennsylvania border.\nThe \u201chotness\u201d index, which underpins the rankings, gauges local housing dynamics by combining median days on market with listing page view activity.\nHomes in the Rochester area, for example, are not only drawing high levels of online interest but are also selling at a faster clip than in much of the country.\nWhile Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse, came in lower at No. 531 nationally, it still placed within the top 25 in New York, underscoring steady regional demand.\nThe broader trend suggests that smaller metro areas in New York \u2014 particularly those with more accessible price points \u2014 are gaining traction amid ongoing affordability challenges in larger cities.\nA recent analysis from Redfin labeled thesmall village of Fairport, New York \u2014\u00a0a suburb roughly 20 minutes outside of Rochester \u2014\u00a0as one of 2025\u2019s hottest neighborhoods.\nMeanwhile, New York state overall has remained steady as the top contender for hottest real estate markets, having four of the nation\u2019sfastest-selling housing marketssince January 2025.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A 22-room classical mansion in Prospect Park South is on sale for $12.49 million, making it the most expensive listing in the bucolic Brooklyn neighborhood \u2014 one that seems a world apart from the city.\nThe unusual and wonderful Brooklyn residence thatBrownstoner once dubbeda \u201cColonial Revival on steroids\u201d returned to the market on Monday with a major facelift, according to StreetEasy. The11,000-plus-square-foot mansion listed for $12.49 million \u2014\u00a0a nearly $10 million jump from its last sale price.\nThe landmarked home\u2019s listing representative, Mike Lubin of Brown Harris Stevens, told The Post that its current owner of eight years, an architect, restored the home to its former pre-war splendor.\n\u201cThis is considered kind of the Grand Dame of the neighborhood,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cIt was built with a lot of architectural detail, and the scale is very, very dramatic.\u201d\nThe home possesses the scale of a county manor, with stately two-story Ionic columns and an expansive porch. The interior spans 11,450 square feet, including nine bedrooms and 7.5 bathrooms.\nWhen the mansion waslast snapped up for $2.75 million in 2017, it was in a state of disrepair with peeling paint and rotting wood marring the once-grand facade. You wouldn\u2019t know it looking at the home today, however. The once \u201ccreepy\u201d home now boasts some of the most impressive curb appeal in the neighborhood, thanks to the extensive renovations.\nThese changes, according to Lubin, included bathroom, kitchen, roof, plumbing and central air upgrades \u2014 as well as restoring the pocket doors, fireplace mantels and 66 wood-framed windows.\n\u201cIt was like a puzzle that had to be taken apart and put back together,\u201d Lubin said.\nThe front double doors lead to a coffered\u00a0hall connected to a front parlor, a reception parlor, a mahogany-clad dining room and a library with bay window. The impressive chef\u2019s kitchen has a 10-foot island, a marble farm sink and its own fireplace \u2014 one of many fireplaces throughout the home.\nThe third floor \u2014 a former ballroom with 16-foot ceilings \u2014 has been converted into an entertainment room featuring a decadent bar and a spiral staircase up to a reading nook.\nThe private backyard, with its large stone patio and green lawn, is one of highlights of the home for Lubin.\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in Connecticut or Long Island,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like an urban garden. It\u2019s incredibly peaceful.\u201d\nAttempts by a previous agent to sell the home for a higher $12.95 million between 2022 and 2023 were unsuccessful, but Lubin said this is partly to blame of the strangeness of the post-pandemic market.\n\u201cThere were offers, but none that they wanted to accept,\u201d he said.\nProspect Park South was largely built by developer Dean Alvord at the turn of the 20th century. Alvord had with a vision of suburbia in the middle of Brooklyn. This residence, at 1305 Albemarle Road, however, was built by the little-known architect Henry B. Moore in 1905.\nThe home was notably featured in the Oscar-winning film \u201cReversal of Fortune,\u201d and scenes from \u201cLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d were filmed on the first floor.\nThe next owner of this opulent home will be in good company \u2014 the famed actress Michelle Williamsbought her own 18-room mansionjust down the block in 2016.\nAdvertisement",

As a result, the national rental vacancy rate surged to 7.1% in the first quarter of 2025, the highest level in nearly seven years.\nWhen looking at rent prices by unit size, studios and one-bedroom properties were down 1.9% year over year nationally, settling at $1,410 and $1,578, respectively, while rents on two-bedroom units declined by 1.7%, to $1,887.\nOverall affordability also slightly improved last month from a year ago. Renters earning the typical household income of $7,263 spent 23.4% of their paycheck to lease a property, compared with 24.7% in April 2024.\nAmong the 50 markets analyzed for the report,\u00a0Oklahoma City, OK, emerged as April\u2019s most affordable city, with the typical family spending just 16.7% of their monthly paycheck on the median rent of $994.\nOther top affordable rental markets included\u00a0Austin, TX,\u00a0Columbus, OH,\u00a0Raleigh, NC, and\u00a0Minneapolis, with the rent share of income in those cities ranging from 17.2% to 18.5%.\nAcross all the tracked markets,\u00a0Kansas City, MO, was the sole outlier where the share of income spent on rent edged up in April, reaching 20.7%, a 1.1 percentage-point increase from a year ago.\n\u201cFortunately, this is still below the recommended share, but the trend indicates a growing cost burden for Kansas City renters,\u201d says Xu.\nIn\u00a0Milwaukee, the rent-to-income ratio also showed no annual improvement, remaining flat with last year, at 26.8%.\nLooking at the most improved markets in terms of affordability, San Diego topped the list in April, after the share of income needed to afford a median rent in the California metro dropped from 35% last year to 31.1.%.\nDenver,\u00a0Jacksonville, FL, Miami,\u00a0Birmingham, AL, and\u00a0Phoenix\u2014all located in either the South or the West\u2014saw their rent-to-income ratios shrink from April 2024, meaning that people in those metros spent less of their monthly paycheck on housing needs.\n\u201cThe primary driver behind this trend in both regions is the increase in new rental supply, which is helping to ease rent pressures,\u201d says Xu.\nAdvertisement",

Artimus and Phoenix Realty Group will head the massive development on two vacant sites along the North Shore\u2019s Stapleton waterfront.\n\u201cWith today\u2019s announcement, we are checking another key box of our North Shore checklist,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe are not only building the affordable homes New Yorkers need but using sustainable materials to reduce our carbon footprint and help turn New York City\u2019s waterways into the \u2018Harbor of the Future.\u2019\u201d\nOne quarter of the 500 units will be designated as affordable, or available to households earning between 40 to 80% of the area median income. This carve-out makes the project \u201cone of the largest mass timber residential projects with affordable housing in the entire country,\u201d according to the city\u2019s announcement.\nMass timber, according to the city, will reduce the project\u2019s carbon footprint and speed up construction time. The engineered wood, made by bonding smaller wood pieces together, is considered a sustainable alternative to other construction materials. In addition to coming from a renewable source, the mass timber also weighs less than steel or concrete.\nThe project is a piece of the mayor\u2019s 2023 pledge to invest $400 million into the borough\u2019s neglected North Shore. In addition to monetary investment, the four-year roadmap for the \u201cStaten Island North Shore Action Plan: Building a Vibrant, Mixed-Use Waterfront Community,\u201d sets out to build 2,400 homes, more than 20 acres of public space, more than 7,500 jobs and $3.8 billion in economic impact over 30 years.\nThe New Stapleton Waterfront, in particular, is turning a former US naval base into a 38-acre mixed-use neighborhood. The city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation broke ground on the next 6 acres of open space and esplanades at the waterfront in September, including the demolition of the old naval buildings.\n\u201cFor too long, Staten Island\u2019s waterfront sat undeveloped and underutilized,\u201d said State Assemblymember Charles D. Fall. \u201cThis project marks a new chapter \u2014 one that brings much-needed housing, creates local jobs, and embraces sustainable building to ensure the North Shore becomes a place that serves our community for generations to come.\u201d\nThe development is the first publicly awarded project to use mass timber at scale in the Northeast United States, according to the city. The use of mass timber plays into another one of Adams\u2019 plans. The mayor\u2019s \u201cGreen Economy Action Plan,\u201d sets out to, among other things, provide New Yorkers with nearly 400,000 projected \u201cgreen-collar\u201d jobs by 2040.\nConstruction is expected to start in 2027.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Atlantic City, where Donald Trump and Steve Wynn were once fierce rivals before they were friends, is heating up in more ways than one as summer approaches.\nNow, an Atlantic City penthouse that once belonged to casino mogul Wynn has listed for $2.19 million. What\u2019s more, it has expanded in size to become a massive 7,500-square-foot duplex.\nThe residence is on Atlantic City\u2019s iconic boardwalk, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\u00a0When Wynn owned the aerie back in the city\u2019s heyday, he hosted glamorous parties. Guests included legends like Frank Sinatra, who performed at Wynn\u2019s neighboring Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino during the 1980s.\nThe current owner bought the sky-high Garden State nest for $450,000, and the adjacent unit for $400,000, in 2015 \u2014 and then combined them.\nIt\u2019s all at the Ocean Club at 3101 Boardwalk. The unit comes with five bedrooms and 6.5 baths.\u00a0Given its history, there\u2019s plenty of space to entertain inside the home, which features a large chef\u2019s kitchen and a roomy area for dining.\nDesign details include lots of gray and white marble, and a smashing terrace overlooking the ocean.\u00a0Building amenities include a gym, an indoor pool, and \u2014 according to the listing \u2014 \u201ca dynamic lifestyle committee that curates engaging social events.\u201dThe listing broker is Stephanie Luongo, of Serhant.\nMeanwhile, in Manhattan,Wynn\u2019s massive duplexat the Ritz-Carlton Residences on Central Park South\u00a0has been off the market for the past six weeks, Gimme Shelter can reveal.\nHe bought that 10,875-square-foot duplex for $70 million in 2012. At the time, it was the most expensive residential purchase in the country.\nTen years later, in 2022, Wynn listed it for a staggering $90 million. By 2023, the penthouse price was dramatically slashed to $65 million. But by last August, the duplex was back on the market with a $5 million bump, asking $70 million \u2014 before it was taken off the market on March 31st.\nSotheby\u2019s Serena Boardman last had that listing.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Despite threats both to the value of downtown office towers and to federal research funding that flows through the city, Boston\u2019s economy is among the strongest in the country and city has a stable financial outlook, two premier credit rating agencies said this month.For the 12th consecutive year, Boston has maintained AAA bond ratings from both Moody\u2019s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings \u2014 an achievement Chief Financial Officer Ashley Groffenberger likened to winning the \u201cfinance Super Bowl.\u201d\u201cAs the current federal administration sows economic chaos and targets the very industries that Boston relies on \u2014 health care, life sciences, higher education, climate technology \u2014 Boston remains determined to fight back against illegal attempts to undermine our economy and our communities,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said Wednesday. \u201cOur AAA bond rating today is proof that despite this federal administration\u2019s best attempts to tear down the pillars of our economy, Boston is well positioned to weather the storm.\u201d The AAA ratings come amid Wu\u2019s reelection campaign \u2014 she faces off this fall against Josh Kraft, a Dorchester nonprofit leader and son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft \u2014 along with ongoing concerns from the business community and elsewhere about the city\u2019s fiscal health in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on office values. AdvertisementAn increase in office vacancy rates in downtown Boston has sparked fears over the city's property tax base, which leans heavily on commercial real estate.Suzanne Kreiter/Globe StaffMoody\u2019s noted Boston\u2019s \u201csound fiscal management\u201d and economic resilience, driven by a diverse mix of industries and anchored by word-renowned health care and educational institutions. However, analysts noted, uncertainty regarding tariffs, immigration, and cuts to the National Institutes of Health funding and other federal support for research and education could lead to higher unemployment, slower economic growth, and demographic shifts. Advertisement\u201cThe city\u2019s resiliency will be challenged over the next several years,\u201d Moody\u2019s Ratings analysts Nicholas Lehman and Thomas Jacobs wrote in a May 8 report. Related: As Wu seeks re-election, some fear her passion for progressive causes has dimmed.Another challenge could come from declining values of commercial real estate. Last year, the city\u2019s commercial property tax base fell in value by 2.9 percent \u2014 its first such decline in 14 years.Multiple office properties have recently sold at prices far below their assessed values. The 36-story One Lincoln St. tower, for example, sold at foreclosure auction for $400 million earlier this year after a $1.1 billion refinancing in 2022. The property\u2019s current assessed value is $588 million. And the 32-story office tower at 99 High St. sold last month for $227 million, some $100 million less than its assessed value. \u201cWe are very concerned and monitoring the ongoing transition that cities across the country and downtowns in particular across the country are experiencing with macroeconomic trends that are really reshaping the purpose of commercial office buildings and and the occupancy of them,\u201d Wu said Wednesday. Though some 71.1 percent of Boston\u2019s $4.8 billion budget for fiscal 2026 is generated by property taxes, declining office values shouldn\u2019t translate into a \u201cmajor revenue disruption\u201d for the city, Groffenberger said. State law restricts how much a city can raise property taxes in any year, and after trying unsuccessfully to do so last year, Wu has again filed a home-rule petition seeking to exceed that limit on commercial property to avoid a steep increase in residential property taxes. AdvertisementThe city\u2019s assessing department has started the process to determine property values for fiscal 2026, Assessing Commissioner Nick Ariniello said Wednesday. That includes asking property owners for information on vacancy, asking rents, and other transactions that the city can use for its fiscal modeling. \u201cIndividual data points kind of help key us in on areas that we maybe want to ask more about, but they don\u2019t define the market for this,\u201d Ariniello said. What\u2019s more, despite last year\u2019s 2.9 percent commercial property value decline, Moody\u2019s noted it would take a multiyear decline of 10 percent or more in the assessed value of commercial properties to lead to a downgrade in the city\u2019s bond rating.Hancock Towers, old and new.Suzanne Kreiter/Globe StaffThe AAA ratings have been granted as the city prepares to issue a nearly $500 million general obligation bond next week, which Groffenberger said will fund close to 200 projects, including renovations at schools, parks, and playgrounds, along with new libraries, community centers, and pools, and energy improvement and infrastructure projects. The AAA rating helps Boston sell those bonds at lower interest rates, saving up to $250,000 annually, or $5 million over the life of the bond, that would have otherwise gone to debt service, Groffenberger said. \u201cThis means we can spend more of our taxpayer dollars on the critical services and priorities that residents expect, instead of the costs associated with financing,\u201d Groffenberger said. \u201cIt should also give residents the confidence that city leadership is acting in a strong, responsible way with their resources.\u201d Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "content": "Walter and Debbie Priebethought they were doing the right thing.\nTheir home inPompano Beach, FL\u2014 which they purchased in 2002 from Walter\u2019s father\u2014needed serious repairs. The walls were infested withtermites. Theroof was failing.\nBut more than that, the house held deep emotional value: Their late son had done the plumbing himself, and the home is set on the water, complete with a seawall and boat lift they\u2019d added over the years. A dream home of their own making.\nIn 2021, the Priebes decided torenovatewith the future in mind. They would fix the roof and add a second story, making space for aging in place while preserving the structure\u2019s sentimental roots.\nDebbie, who had worked for a real estate attorney for nearly 25 years, anticipated that theirproperty taxesmight increase.\nBut when the final tax bill arrived in 2023 after construction was complete, their taxes had skyrocketed from $15,000 a year to more than $90,000\u2014six times their previous bill, and nearly double what they had estimated their new tax liability would be.\nThe reason? Their remodel had triggered a full reassessment of the property\u2019s value, and high demand for homes in their neighborhood had driven home prices sky-high.\nWhile the Priebes had bought the home in 2002 for $650,000, it was now assessed at over $4.4 million.\nAt the core of the Priebes\u2019 story is a confluence of factors that have been quietly brewing beneath the surface of the housing market.\nWhile national conversations on affordability have largely focused on mortgage rates and first-time buyers, another crisis has been gaining steam: Property taxes are becoming unaffordable, even for longtime homeowners who have stayed put for decades.\nThe Priebes knew their property tax protections were at risk. In Florida, the homestead exemption reduces the taxable value of a primary residence by up to $50,000, while the Save Our Homes cap limits annual increases in assessed value to 3% or the consumer price index \u2014 whichever is lower.\nSo, before beginning renovations, they reached out to the Broward County Property Appraiser\u2019s Office to confirm those protections would remain in place while they temporarily relocated during construction \u2014 a step confirmed in documents reviewed byRealtor.com\u00ae.\n\u201cWe thought that if we kept the foundation and the outer walls of the house and we just took the roof off, it was our understanding that we were going to preserve our Save Our Homes and our homestead,\u201d says Debbie.\nTheir hope was, when they moved back into the home, only the value of the new addition would bereassessedat the current market value, not the property as a whole.\nBut the renovations \u2014 removing the roof, adding a second floor \u2014 ultimately triggered a full reassessment of the home\u2019s value. Under Florida law, once a property is deemed substantially improved, it can be treated as new construction, removing the protections that had capped the home\u2019s assessed value for years.\n\u201cThey called this a brand-new house. Now, if you look on the tax roll, we\u2019ve owned the home since 2022,\u201d she says. In fact, the Priebes have owned the home since 2002.\nThe Priebes fought the county\u2019s valuation using their contractor invoices, appraisal documentation, and historical records of improvements. Still, the final assessed value \u2014 based on recent sales, not cost to build \u2014 stood.\n\u201cWe had a magistrate who actually agreed with us,\u201d Debbie says. \u201cBut he said, \u2018Unfortunately, I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s because Florida law requires county appraisers to reassess a homesteaded property at just value \u2014 essentially, market value\u2014after substantial improvements are made. Substantial improvements include things like expansions and major structural changes, not cosmetic upgrades, explains\u00a0Mila Schwartzreich, general counsel for\u00a0Broward County Property Appraisers.\nFrom the county appraiser\u2019s perspective, dealing with situations like the Priebes\u2019 is a balancing act. The law requires market-based assessments. But local officials are often caught between the letter of the law and its real-world consequences.\n\u201cWe do have the law to comply with,\u201d Schwartzreich says. \u201cIt really puts us in the middle.\u201d\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nBut what was driving up market values so high that a reassessment could trigger such a dramatic change in tax burden? It turns out that the Priebes were up against yet another factor that\u2019s been transforming the housing market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought in a surge of out-of-state buyers paying record-setting prices for Florida homes. Just before the Priebes completed their renovation, a neighboring home was sold for $4.9 million, and Debbie immediately sensed trouble.\n\u201cAll-cash offers are typically the product of highly competitive housing markets,\u201d explains\u00a0Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst for Realtor.com. \u201cBuyers use all-cash offers to win in a multiple-bid scenario, signaling a level of competition that goes hand in hand with home price growth.\u201d\nAnd while that home price growth is typically seen as a net positive for homeowners because it adds to their equity, it can become an albatross for those who can\u2019t afford the higher property taxes that come with it.\nIn 2002, when the Priebes bought their home for $650,000, 37% of home transactions were purchased with all cash\u2014well above the national share of 15% of sales. By 2023, when the Priebes were hit with their shocking tax bill, 62% of home sales in their ZIP code had been conducted in all cash, according to data from Realtor.com.\n\u201cBig-budget buyers are the most able to participate in today\u2019s high-price, high-rate housing market, and these buyers are more likely to buy higher-priced homes and pay all-cash, driving home sale prices higher and the all-cash share higher,\u201d explains Jones.\nBut appraisers still have to factor these sales into their assessments.Cash salesare considered valid under Florida law, even if the buyer paid above asking, explains Schwartzreich.\nIt\u2019s one thing to talk about market dynamics. But for the Priebes, the stakes are painfully real: Their home is on the line\u2014and they\u2019re not alone.\n\u201cYou should not be in the situation where you have to give up your home because you cannot afford the taxes,\u201d Florida\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0recently said at a\u00a0roundtable\u00a0on property tax relief in the state.\nDeSantis has expressed support for eliminating property taxes altogether \u2014 a sweeping proposal that\u2019s stirring debate. But such a change faces steep hurdles. Property taxes are the single largest source of revenue for local governments, funding essential services like public schools, first responders, and infrastructure.\nStill, for families like the Priebes, relief can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing this for money,\u201d Debbie says. \u201cWe did this to try to preserve our home and stay in order to retire here.\u201d\nTheir $90,000 annual tax bill may ultimately prove too much to bear. But they\u2019re holding out hope that momentum around reform might arrive in time to help them stay in the home they\u2019ve poured decades of love and savings into.",

        "content": "When the Boston Planning and Development Agency board meets Thursday evening, the members are scheduled to certify completion of nearly 1 million square feet of brand new lab space across the city. Some of it is in the new Boston home of Eli Lilly & Co., a $700 million research and development facility along Fort Point Channel. That lab started construction without a tenant, but the pharmaceutical giant eventually leased the whole thing and moved in last year.Meanwhile, at the other end of Boston\u2019s Seaport District, a new lab and amenities building developed at the former headquarters of Au Bon Pain is opening empty. That project began construction with a tenant signed: Ginkgo Bioworks. Last year, amid broader financial troubles, the company said it no longer needed the space and would not move in. And in Boston Landing, sandwiched between the Celtics\u2019 Auerbach Center and the Bruins\u2019 Warrior Ice Arena, stands a 350,000-square-foot, $545 million lab that will open empty but for a first-floor coffeeshop. The BPDA board is scheduled to certify both buildings complete.The duality is a hallmark of Greater Boston\u2019s lab market these days. Bright spots surely remain, such as big new lab buildings for AstraZeneca and Takeda under construction in Kendall Square. But many more life-science buildings are empty, with little demand to fill them \u2014 and little obvious function other than lab space.AdvertisementNearly one-third of lab space across the region is available for lease, either directly from a landlord or via sublease from an occupant who no longer needs it. And while the first quarter of this year marked the first time since 2022 with no new labs wrapping construction in Greater Boston, there are still some 3 to 4 million square feet worth of space underway, research from Newmark and Colliers shows, enough to grow the market by more than 5 percent.AdvertisementThat vacancy is going to linger \u2014 and will have many landlords facing loans they can\u2019t pay back, said Jeff Myers, research director at real estate firm Colliers. That could lead to some sales at rock-bottom prices.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a mounting amount of distress that\u2019s going to force these buildings to change hands,\u201d Myers said. \u201cDistress is probably going to increase and linger in the market. I don\u2019t see an easy way around that.\u201d Related: Kara Miller: Is Boston\u2019s biotech industry doomed? | The Big IdeaColliers research shows there\u2019s some 16.3 million square feet of lab space available in Greater Boston. But there\u2019s just 1.9 million square feet of tenants looking for space. \u201cWe still do have tenants that are active in the market,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe pipeline is not as robust as it was a few years ago, but it\u2019s not zero. It\u2019s not empty.\u201dIndeed, Cambridge and Greater Boston remain the world\u2019s preeminent biotech hub, with long-term fundamentals that will remain strong, industry proponents say. But there\u2019s growing worry that the sector\u2019s vitality faces unprecedented threats from President Trump\u2019s administration. Trump\u2019s administration has moved to make deep cuts to National Institutes of Health funding and other federal investment in biomedical research, and Governor Maura Healey has warned that every dollar cut from research activity results in $2-3 more dollars lost in economic activity. They also threaten to cut off new research at the knees before it can help power the sort of companies that need big labs here.AdvertisementA new life science building alongside CambridgeSide shopping center in East Cambridge.\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffSome life-science tenants looking for space aren\u2019t even looking for labs \u2014 just offices. BXP, the office development giant, formerly known as Boston Properties, recently told analysts it had closed one such deal in Waltham and was negotiating another.\u201cThese life science companies are looking exclusively for office space as they focus their capital on acquiring de-risked products that are in trials rather than pure drug discovery and therefore, don\u2019t need lab infrastructure,\u201d BXP President Doug Linde said on a recent earnings call. An oversupply of life science laboratories and research and development space isn\u2019t just a Boston problem \u2014 a surge of new labs are opening empty across the country this year, according to a recent report from CBRE. And state officials have made clear they know what filling that space means to the Massachusetts economy.Related: Unleased lab space. Plunging valuations. Layoffs. In Massachusetts, the biotech slump is taking its toll.Indeed, just last year the Legislature approved $500 million over 10 years toward the state\u2019s life science initiative. (That funding, however, was just half the initial $1 billion Healey sought.) The first decade-long, $1 billion life-science initiative launched in 2008 under former Governor Deval Patrick, with a five-year, $500 million extension approved in 2018 by former Governor Charlie Baker. \u201cNothing happened by accident,\u201d said House Speaker Ron Mariano at an event for industry group MassBio last month. \u201cThe cluster of innovation that we enjoy here today is a product of the deliberate policy choice and of a long-term strategy by the Massachusetts Legislature to capitalize on our world-class universities (and) hospitals to create a true innovation economy.\u201d AdvertisementMariano touted the commonwealth\u2019s 117,000 biopharma employees and Massachusetts\u2019 longstanding reign as the NIH\u2018s top-funded state per capita. \u201cWe are as of today,\u201d Mariano said at the April 7 event. \u201cWhich is subject to change, I guess.\u201dCatherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

        "subhead": "The answer depends on the area where the home is located, the condition of the property, and if any updates will actually add to the sale price.",
        "content": "ByMadeline Bilis\n\nWhen it comes time to put your home on the market, you\u2019ll likely trytoenvisionit through the eyes of a buyer. Will they bristle at the cherry wood kitchen cabinets? Will the carpeting in the bedrooms be a turnoff?\n\nYou may wonder:Should you make any renovations before listing?\n\n\u201cIt is the absolute most common question that we get,\u201d saidPamela Bathen, a broker with Oak Realty in Ashland. \u201cPeople tend to go down a rabbit hole online and think they know what to update.\u201d\n\nThe answer depends on a variety of factors, including the area where the home is located, the condition of the property, and if any updates will actually add to the sale price.\n\n\u201cI usually recommend focusing on visible, high-impact areas that buyers immediately notice \u2014 kitchens, bathrooms, curb appeal \u2014 while also making sure the house is functionally sound,\u201d saidRahel Choi, a realtor with eXp Realty on Newbury Street.\n\nIt\u2019s a seller\u2019s market in Greater Boston right now, so forgoing a renovation won\u2019t hurt your chances of a sale. Upgrades could, however, significantly increase the final price.\n\n\nDeciding if and when to upgrade, along with what updates should be made, is not a one-size-fits-all process. According to Opendoor\u2019sHome Condition Report, homes in better condition close at or above their listing price nearly 10 percent more often than homes that need work, and sell more than 20 percent faster. \u201cThat said, the choice between selling as is or upgrading hinges on your moving timeline, selling goals, and local real estate market dynamics,\u201d saidBryson Taggart, Opendoor\u2019s real estate trend expert.\n\n\n\n\nIn MetroWest, where Bathen works, there\u2019s one general rule she abides by. \u201cI will say that most of the time we default toward: Everything has to work. You know, the heating, the plumbing, the electrical, the roof \u2014 all the basics have to work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s rare that we recommend major updates or major renovations just before selling, unless they\u2019re operationally damaged.\u201d\n\nWhile it may not be worth getting, say, a new roof to impress buyers, there are cases where updated systems can net a moderate return on investment. If the heating system in a home is decades old but the rest of the home features sparkling updates, putting in a higher-end system could boost the sale. \u201cThat $10,000 will probably bring you an extra 15,\u201d Bathen said.\n\nIf the house is dated and the furnace is on its last leg, it may not be worth fixing. Instead, you can disclose it. \u201cDisclosure is huge in this situation,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really get cranky about non-updated things as long as they\u2019re disclosed.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, many sellers want negotiating power, points outJosh Muncey, owner of the Muncey Group in Chestnut Hill. \u201cLet\u2019s say you have a water heater that has a 10-year warranty and is in its 10th or 11th year. You could replace it, but then the buyer will have a home inspection, and sometimes they\u2019re just looking for a win.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if the buyer isn\u2019t making a request related to the water heater, they\u2019ll likely make a request about something else. \u201cSo holding back a repair like that if you need to make a concession can sometimes be better to have in your back pocket,\u201d Muncey said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not necessarily determining if the buyer falls in love with the home.\u201d\n\nAs long as a property is clean, has systems and appliances that work, and generally feels move-in ready, large-scale renovations aren\u2019t make or break. There is one exception to the rule: the luxury market. If a home is listed for more than $2 million, updated systems and a modern kitchen and bathroom are often expected, said the agents.\n\n\nJust because a renovation isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, making small updates can significantly affect a home\u2019s final sale price. According to the National Association of Realtors\u20192025 Remodeling Impact Report, smaller projects like installing a new steel front door can result in a 188 percent return on investment at the time of resale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about the superficial. We call it the glitter. You know, the granite, the stainless steel, or what have you. What makes a property feel fresh and new,\u201d Muncey said.\n\nThe project at the top of the list? Painting the walls. Next comes light cosmetic alterations like swapping out old light fixtures and cabinet hardware.\n\nIn some cases, a small refresh can make a huge difference. Recently, Muncey sold a sprawling six-bedroom home in Jamaica Plain, where the previous owners had lived for the past 50 years. It was fairly outdated with an old electrical system, which he estimated put its listing price around $1.1 million. He recommended some purely cosmetic changes \u2014 a top-to-bottom paint job, refinishing the floors, brightening the living spaces \u2014 to freshen up the place, and listed it at $1,195,000. Close to 10 offers were made, with a final sale price of $1.5 million. A total spend of $40,000 on updates, including home staging, resulted in a sale price that was $300,000 higher than it may have been previously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a seller\u2019s market. You can sell no matter what. It\u2019s easy to convince yourself \u2018I don\u2019t need to do it,\u2019\u201d Muncey said. \u201cDo you want to unlock your full equity in the home? Would you make a $10,000 investment if you thought it would net you $50,000? That\u2019s the kind of option we can give people.\u201d\n\n\nMadeline BilisMadeline Bilis is a freelance journalist based in Boston, where she covers real estate, travel, and design.

        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nQ.My partner and I have a question about our windows. The home we bought 20 years ago had \u201cnewer\u201d windows that had replaced the original windows in the house. The house was originally built in the \u201950s, part of the GI Bill housing for veterans. Over time, some of these newer windows have developed a haze or fog in between the two panes of glass. Is there any way to deal with that without full window replacement? Hoping for an easy and cost-effective solution.\n\nK from Norwood\n\nA.I wish I could say there was an easy solution to that problem, but unfortunately, there isn\u2019t. Hard to tell how old the windows are, but they sound like early generation Thermopane windows. This is when manufacturers started using two panes of glass to better insulate the interior from the elements.\n\nWhat can happen over time is the exterior seal fails and moisture gets in between the two panes. Sometimes, you will see the actual moisture, usually in colder months, but in the long term, the moisture leaves behind a film on the inside of the glass. That is impossible to remove since it is in between the glass panes and you are stuck with foggy or hazy windows.\n\nThe only option is to replace the windows, which is not the worst thing since windows and doors have come a long way in terms of performance. What I would recommend is to have them replaced with window inserts (most likely that is what you have now since they are a second-generation window), which would keep the cost down. Window inserts are installed from the inside without having to remove exterior trim. It is also minimally invasive on the inside, which serves to make the replacement quicker and thus less expensive. Window inserts can be all vinyl, which is the least expensive option. A little pricier is a window insert that is clad on the exterior and wood on the interior. This allows you to paint the interior the existing trim color. It also makes the window look more like an original part of the house.\n\nQ.We\u2019re hoping you can help us untangle a dilemma before we make an expensive misstep.\n\nWe\u2019re planning to install an underground irrigation system at our home, a 1950s house (on municipal water) with a very large yard that\u2019s become a real chore to water with hoses and sprinklers. We\u2019ve consulted several irrigation installers and plumbers to get quotes and advice, but we\u2019ve hit a confusing snag: our water pressure.\n\nOne plumber measured our municipal water pressure at about 35\u201340 PSI [pounds per square inch] and warned us that it\u2019s too low to reliably support an irrigation system. He advised that even with a booster pump, the improvement might be short-lived. His reasoning was that our water line lacks enough reserve capacity \u2014 the pump could give a quick boost, but then the pressure would quickly drop again.\n\nI\u2019ve also spoken with several other professionals, including from our town water department, who were surprised by that claim. They told me that booster pumps are designed for exactly this scenario \u2014 to increase low pressure \u2014 and they hadn\u2019t heard of them failing in this way.\n\nOur plan is to install an irrigation system with about 10 zones, so we want to make sure we have enough consistent pressure to support it. We\u2019re stuck. We\u2019d hate to spend thousands on a booster pump and irrigation system only to discover it won\u2019t work as intended.\n\nIs the risk of failure real, or is this plumber being overly cautious? And is there any way to confirm whether an irrigation system will function reliably with our current water supply before we commit?\n\nThank you for helping us water our way out of this puzzle.\n\nMarissa, Walpole\n\nA.I talked to our plumber about this one just to be sure. We typically work around existing inground irrigation systems but don\u2019t install them. However, we do install the occasional water pressure booster pumps when a particular neighborhood has low pressure off the street and we are adding bathrooms, etc.\n\nTo date, we have never had a complaint that the system isn\u2019t keeping up with domestic water needs, especially with modern pumps that are variable speed and can ramp up and down as needed. In addition to that, most of our clients who have irrigation systems have them coming on quite early in the morning, before the whole family is up showering and getting ready. That makes for a lot less strain on the systems\u2019 water pressure.\n\nAll that said, I would side with the various professionals you have spoken with and the town\u2019s water department and say that a pressure booster system is exactly what you would need installed. The installer would have the best answer as to what size booster you need based on the area to be covered and the number of zones, pressure off the street, etc. This should be on its own designated circuit, so there\u2019s some electrical work involved in addition to the irrigation and monitoring system.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

It\u2019s also a good spot to take in the new extensive deck on the first level, a smaller private deck on the upper level, and a stairway on the left leading to the front door.\n\nThe stairwell ends in an expanse of cobblestones before three steps to the wooden porch and the mahogany front door. Beyond is the 131-square-foot foyer that has a stairwell on its left, and an entrance to the kitchen on the right.\n\nDo not stop. Because ahead, is the 211-square-foot living room, where six large windows in two layers dominate the exterior wall, drawing sunlight and giving those inside an excellent view. The cathedral ceiling hosts a light fixture that evokes images of a wagon wheel that shines down onto the luxury vinyl tile flooring, which runs through the house.\n\n\nTo the left of the wall of windows is a propane gas fireplace framed by black porcelain tile topped by a rustic wood mantle. Built-in shelving flanks the fireplace.\n\nTo the right is the 109-square-foot dining room. Most often these rooms are closed-off affairs with built-in shelving or a fireplace serving as the key feature. Not here, where the room has a large slider \u2014 plus one window \u2014 to the deck ringing the home. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t classic details such as the central light fixture of white globes and the planks of lightly stained pine from which it is suspended. There is also a set of double-hung windows.\n\n\nThe 182-square-foot kitchen follows. It shares the planks of pine ceiling first encountered in the dining room. A pair of pendant lights is above a white island with a quartz countertop that seats three. The white cabinets are made of maple with birch doors. The countertops are white quartz, and the backsplash is matte white porcelain tile. Appliances are mainly stainless steel, including the propane gas stove.\n\n\nBack in the foyer, a hallway on the left leads to a section of the home with a 78-square-foot full bath and a 167-square-foot bedroom currently being used as a family room. The room has a central light fixture and sliders to the wide deck defined by a cable railing.\n\nThe bath is the last room on the left and has a floating single vanity with a white ceramic topand a shower behind clear glass doors. The shower flooring and backsplash are a mix of ceramic and porcelain tile. This bathroom also contains the laundry closet and a linen closet.\n\n\nThe second floor hosts the primary suite, two additional bedrooms, and a third full bath, all connected by a 15-foot-long loft that overlooks the first level.\n\nThe primary suite is on the left side of this home and is accessed by a short hallway that leads directly toward the 34-square-foot walk-in closet. To the right is the 167-square-foot bedroom. There is an gray-blue accent walland a slab of pine planks with recessed lighting running along the ceilingin the rear of the room. A slider opens to the private exterior deck that offers seasonal ocean views, according to the listing agent,Christine Fiske of eXp Realty in Boston.\n\n\nThe 67-square-foot private bath is at the other end of the suite and has a double vanity made of oak underneath individual mirrors and a pair of light fixtures with three white globes. The white countertop is quartz. The shower has a clear glass door, a bench, and a single large circular showerhead. The flooring and shower backsplash are a combination of ceramic and porcelain tile.\n\nAt the opposite end of the house are the secondary bedrooms (118 and 106 square feet), and each has a pair of double-hung windows on two exterior walls.\n\nThe 54-square-foot full bath has a single walnut vanity with a white counter and gold fixtures. There is a combination shower/bath while the flooring is a mix of ceramic and porcelain tile.\n\nThe lower level has a 202-square-foot family room, access to the garage, storage, and a utility closet. There is also a wet bar with a butcher block counter and wood cabinets set aside in a 66-square-foot area. Nearby is the final full bath. It\u2019s 40 square feet and has a shower insert, a single vanity, and luxury vinyl flooring.\n\nAs part of the updating, the front lawn has been cleared to create space for a play area or fire pit. The home also has a high-efficiency electric heat pump.\n\nJohn R. Ellement can be reached at[email\u00a0protected]. Follow him@JREbosglobe. Send listings to[email\u00a0protected].

        "content": "In The Bronx, a white house for sale delivers some strong ties to a man who later made his way to the White House.\nThis property, located at 5040 Independence Ave. in Riverdale, has listed for $6.45 million and spans more than 17,000 square feet on a lush 1.2-acre parcel overlooking the Hudson River, The Post has learned.\nMoreover, it\u2019s the site where President John F. Kennedy resided during his middle school years in the 1920s while attending the prestigious Riverdale Country School, and where his younger brother Robert F. Kennedy famously returned for a visit during his Senate campaign in 1964.\nBut its stately proportions are only part of the story.\nThe home JFK once knew is long gone \u2014 demolished decades ago \u2014 but something new now stands on the land, and it\u2019s looking for a new owner.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a few families and a few iterations of houses before this one,\u201d said Dustin Crouse, who is co-listing the property with Erin Boisson Aries of Douglas Elliman. \u201cThe current family has owned it since 1991 and developed it over two generations. It\u2019s been a labor of vision \u2014 and of time.\u201d\nThe original home that once stood here \u2014 a three-story stucco residence built in 1907 \u2014 was purchased by the Kennedy family when Joseph P. Kennedy moved the clan from Massachusetts in pursuit of business and political influence.\nJFK lived at the Riverdale address from the fifth through seventh grades.\nThough that home is no longer standing, some fragments of its presence remain.\n\u201cThere are structural elements in the basement \u2014 sort of a stone room \u2014 that date back to earlier versions of the property,\u201d Crouse said.\nThe new mansion, completed but not fully customized, offers approximately 17,620 interior square feet and 4,500 square feet of terraces.\nA dramatic triple-height atrium, inspired by the Guggenheim Museum, forms the architectural heart of the home. Its rotunda-style curves and skylit openness speak to a modern vision \u2014 one far removed from the homey bones of JFK\u2019s era.\nThere are nine bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two powder rooms.\nThe main residence is complemented by a 2,000-square-foot guest cottage with three additional bedrooms and its own two-car garage.\nA 10-car garage sits below the main house, which also includes a sprawling sunken living room, a formal dining room, a media room, a library and a large eat-in kitchen with an adjacent morning terrace.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an additional 7,500 square feet in the basement that could be further developed that they haven\u2019t touched \u2014 it\u2019s raw space right now,\u201d Crouse said.\nRather than completing the interiors to their own tastes, the sellers opted to leave key design decisions up to the next owner. The property is being delivered with a temporary certificate of occupancy and will require finishing touches such as flooring, railings and tiles.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to rip anything out or do a teardown,\u201d Crouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s purely a design project. It\u2019s customizable for a new purchaser to come in to create extraordinary generational living.\u201d\nThe reason for the sale is simple: the family is downsizing.\n\u201cTheir lifestyle has changed. They no longer need something this large,\u201d Crouse added.\nThe residence sits adjacent to Wave Hill Gardens, a historic public garden and cultural center that has hosted everyone from Mark Twain to Theodore Roosevelt.\nNearby are the Riverdale Yacht Club, and Van Cortlandt Park\u2019s golf course, stables and hiking trails \u2014 amenities that speak to a long-standing ideal of Riverdale as New York\u2019s closest approximation of country life.\n\u201cThe beauty of this place is that you can live like you\u2019re in the countryside but still be 30 minutes from Midtown,\u201d Crouse said.\nRiverdale was once among the most fashionable retreats for wealthy New Yorkers.\n\u201cAt the turn of the last century, this was a very popular destination for families,\u201d Crouse said. \u201cThat\u2019s coming back.\u201d\nAnd Riverdale isn\u2019t the only location where traces of JFK\u2019s childhood have been paved over by modern luxury.\nThe Kennedy family\u2019s6-acre Bronxville estate\u2014 where JFK lived from 1929 to 1941 \u2014 was demolished in the 1950s. It was later subdivided into three homes, including a colonial-style house at 4 Crown Circle that sold in 2024 for $4.7 million.\nStill, for Kennedy history buffs, 5040 Independence holds a unique distinction: it\u2019s where the young Jack Kennedy likely threw balls in the backyard, made his way to school and began to emerge as the boy who would one day become the 35th president of the United States.\nIn 1964, Robert F. Kennedy returned to the property on the campaign trail for his New York Senate bid.\nHe remembered the nearby school but confessed he didn\u2019t remember much of the house, theNew York Timesreported at the time. Still, the visit became a symbolic retort to accusations that RFK was a political outsider \u2014 a \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d \u2014 in New York.\nKennedy told students at Mount St. Vincent College after visiting the home that New York had shaped who he was having lived there for the first 20 years of his life.\nA brass plaque later installed by the New York Community Trust marks the site\u2019s presidential significance.\nCrouse sees strong potential for renewed interest in Riverdale\u2019s estate market.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed, especially in the last couple of years since the pandemic is that I\u2019ve just seen a return of a lot of people that have lived in Manhattan and Connecticut or other places sort of nearby, like Westchester, that are returning to Riverdale and returning to the larger, larger homes that have been available,\u201d Crouse said.\nRecent sales seem to bear that out.\n\u201cLast year, a $7 million sale closed for a 1.5-acre property nearby,\u201d Crouse said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big number for Riverdale.\u201d\nWhat sets this home apart, he added, is the sheer scale of the offering \u2014 inside and out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing else like it,\u201d Crouse said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Another storied property in Connecticut\u2019s sought-after Thimble Islands is on the market.\nRogers Island, a private 7.65-acre landmass in the Long Island Sound, is back on sale for $29.99 million. Not only is the property $5 million cheaper than when it listed last May \u2014 the sellers threw in an extra seaside compound on the mainland to sweeten the pot.\nThe island, accessible only by boat, includes a 123-year-old Tudor house, a waterfront pool, a putting green and a plethora of outbuildings.\nThe green oasis served as a summer getaway for the family of its current owner, Greg Jensen,Mansion Global reported. Jensen serves as co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund firm.\nThe plural properties, including the extra house on the mainland, relisted on Tuesday with Joseph Barbieri and Leslie McElwreath of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, as announced by the brokerage in a Tuesday press release. The island previously went on sale last May with a different brokerage for $35 million.\nRoger Island\u2019s 8,746-square-foot Tudor house includes 10 bedrooms and two kitchens \u2014 one for marbletop entertaining and one tucked away for catering. The island further boasts a saltwater pool with a spa, a poolhouse with a waterside pergola, a gazebo, a tennis court and a putting green.\nBarbieri called the idyllic archipelago an \u201calternative to the Hamptons.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d never get anything like this for this price,\u201d Barbieri said. \u201cThey\u2019re not many of these that exist, period.\u201d\nOutbuildings dot the island, including a four-bedroom guest cottage with a kitchen and a commercial-sized greenhouse. A studio cottage with an outdoor shower can double as a spa or an artist\u2019s studio, according to the listing.\nThe island itself is designed for smooth staff support. Next to the greenhouse are staff quarters with two ensuite bedrooms and kitchenettes. One pier is dedicated for service deliveries, while the other one \u2014 with direct access to the main house \u2014 is reserved for owners and guests.\nThe island is named for John Rogers, an original settler in the area. Roger\u2019s family owned the island from 1710 to 1858, according to the listing.\nJensen paid $21.5 million for the property in 2018. Barbieri said the family is parting with the home now that their children have grown up.\nThey\u2019ve even thrown 51 Flying Point Road into the bargain. The seaside compound in Stony Creek, Barbieri said, offers the next owners of Rogers Island easy access to their vacation home, or can be used as additional staff or guest housing.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "The last remaining New York City property owned by the estate of celebrated pop artist Roy Lichtenstein has found a buyer, The Post has learned.\nLocated at 739 Washington Street in Manhattan\u2019s West Village, the redbrick Greek Revival townhouse sold this week for $6.525 million, marking the latest step in the methodical dissolution of the artist\u2019s once-expansive real estate footprint.\nTucked away on a quiet block steps from the Hudson River, the three-story home built in 1845 spans nearly 3,700 square feet and retains many of its 19th-century details, including pumpkin pine floors, six fireplaces and intricate molding.\nDespite being used as an office for the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation in recent years, the home\u2019s layout and period charm offered strong appeal to buyers drawn to historic authenticity in a neighborhood increasingly dotted with modern conversions.\nIt was initially listed for $6.9 million in November before entering into contract just a few short months later, at the start of 2025.\nClayton Orrigo, also of Compass, represented the unidentified buyer.\nThe building sits directly adjacent to Lichtenstein\u2019s longtime home and studio, a former metalworking shop at 741/745 Washington Street, donated in 2022 by his widow, Dorothy Lichtenstein, to the Whitney Museum of American Art.\nAccording to Lee Ann Jaffee of Compass, who co-listed the property with colleague Steven Sumser, \u201cIt was a guest house. I shouldn\u2019t say he never lived there. I do not know of him ever living there. It was always represented to me that it was a guest house.\u201d\nJust a few feet south lies 747 Washington Street, a garage that once housed the artist\u2019s personal art and wine collection.\nThe Post previously reported that the propertysold earlier this yearfor $5.5 million to an anonymous buyer operating under the LLC \u201cWHAAM-NOMAD\u201d\u2014 a not-so-subtle nod to Lichtenstein\u2019s iconic 1963 painting \u201cWhaam!\u201d\nThe sale of 739 Washington concludes a physical chapter in the Lichtenstein estate\u2019s multi-year effort to downsize and distribute the artist\u2019s holdings following Dorothy\u2019s death last July. She had spent decades preserving and stewarding her husband\u2019s legacy through exhibitions, donations and the meticulous cataloguing of his oeuvre through the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation.\nThat work has culminated in a broader unwinding.\nThe foundation has announced it will cease operations by 2026, having fulfilled its mission of publishing Lichtenstein\u2019s catalogue raisonn\u00e9 and distributing thousands of works and archival materials to institutions around the world.\nAmong the most prominent recipients, the Whitney now occupies Lichtenstein\u2019s former Manhattan studio as the permanent home of its Independent Study Program.\nThe building \u2014 originally constructed in 1912 \u2014 was where Lichtenstein lived, painted, and entertained visitors during his later years.\n\u201cHe worked downstairs, ate lunch at the same diner every day, and lived upstairs in a one-bedroom with Dorothy,\u201d according toCurbed. The space is currently being renovated by Johnston Marklee, the architecture firm behind major museum projects in Houston and Chicago.\nJust next door, the garage at 747 Washington has a more utilitarian design, but it proved equally valuable.\nIn addition to room for four cars, it includes a steel-and-wood staircase leading to a private office, a landscaped roof deck and skyline views.\nBeyond Manhattan, the artist\u2019s coastal sanctuary is also on the market.\nIn September, the couple\u2019s longtime home, once a carriage house on Southampton\u2019s prestigious Gin Lane, was listed for $19.99 million,The Post reported.\nThe 2-acre property, where Roy worked in a separate studio across the lawn and Dorothy ultimately passed away last summer, had never before been for sale in the 54 years since the Lichtensteins purchased it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make a really nice home for somebody because it\u2019s unique,\u201d Harald Grant of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, one of the co-listing agents, told The Post.\nWhile the real estate assets are being dispersed, the centerpiece of the estate\u2019s final chapter is unfolding this evening and Friday night at Sotheby\u2019s New York.\nMore than 40 works from the private collection of Roy and Dorothy Lichtenstein are headed to the auction block as part of the house\u2019s marquee Contemporary Evening and Day Sales.\nEstimated to exceed $35 million in total, the works chart four decades of the artist\u2019s output\u2014from early drawings to large-scale paintings, sculptures, and prints.\n\u201cFrom drawings to paintings to sculpture, this phenomenal group of works provides a front row seat to Lichtenstein\u2019s incomparable genius,\u201d David Galperin, Sotheby\u2019s Vice Chairman and Head of Contemporary Art in New York, said in a statement.\n\u201cTogether, the group is a survey of the artist\u2019s reflections of art history over four decades of practice.\u201d\nAmong the highlights is Reflections: Art (1988), estimated to fetch between $4 million and $6 million. The acrylic-on-canvas piece belongs to Lichtenstein\u2019s celebrated \u201cReflections\u201d series, where he obscured iconic images with simulated glass glares \u2014 both a play on illusion and a metaphor for art\u2019s relationship to perception.\n\u201cTo my father, art was all about composition,\u201d said Mitchell Lichtenstein, the artist\u2019s son, in a statement. \u201cWhen asked for comment about his subject matter, he often said, \u2018It\u2019s just marks on a page.\u2019\u201d\nOther marquee offerings include Woman: Sunlight, Moonlight (1996), a double-sided sculpture in painted wood \u2014 a study for a bronze edition later acquired by institutions like The Broad in Los Angeles \u2014 and Stretcher Frame with Cross Bars III (1968), one of only eleven such works exploring the backside of a painting.\n\u201cThe amusing aspect of the Stretcher Frame painting is that of the two sides of a canvas, it depicts the side we least want to see,\u201d said Mitchell.\nSculptures such as Mirror I (1976) echo the artist\u2019s lifelong fascination with the idea of reflection and illusion, while collage studies like Interior with African Mask (Study) (1990) reveal his painstaking process in constructing his \u201cInteriors\u201d series, which poked fun at the aspirational settings common in shelter magazines.\n\u201cOne amusing thing to consider about the Interior series is that the generic furniture ad aesthetic of the rooms depicted in them is likely to be antithetical to the taste of the collector and to the room in which they hang the work,\u201d Mitchell noted.\nOther featured works include Haystacks (1968), Lichtenstein\u2019s tongue-in-cheek nod to Monet\u2019s Impressionist series, reinterpreted with bold Ben-Day dots; Entablature (1975), incorporating sand from the Southampton beaches near his studio; and Cover Image (The Gun in America) for Time Magazine (Study) (circa 1968), a graphite-on-paper rendering originally commissioned in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.\n\u201cLichtenstein was keenly aware of his place in the lineage of art history,\u201d said Lucius Elliott, Head of Sotheby\u2019s Contemporary Evening Auctions in New York. \u201cThe crux of his practice is this interrogation of the nature of art and image making.\u201d\nBorn in New York City in 1923, Roy\u2019s early artistic ambitions took shape at Ohio State University, where he studied after World War II.\nHe rose to fame in the 1960s for his stylized comic book paintings \u2014\u00a0and went on to produce over 5,000 works spanning media, genres, and decades. Despite early critical controversy, his pieces are now held by museums including MoMA, the Whitney, the Centre Pompidou, and the Art Institute of Chicago.\nHis widow, Dorothy, was instrumental in cementing that legacy. A Brooklyn native and former gallery director, she co-founded the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation and was its longtime president, overseeing major donations of more than 1,000 works to institutions worldwide.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "The two-story palace in the sky that William Randolph Hearst, the larger-than-life media mogul who inspired \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d built for his mistress is on sale.\nThe $26 million listing marks the co-op unit\u2019s first sale of the 21st century. The Ritz Tower residence, commissioned by the building\u2019s one-time owner, Hearst, for actress Marion Davies, boasts 17th-century cathedral glass windows, monastic doors and triple-terraced views of Manhattan.\nMichael Kotler of Douglas Elliman holds the historic listing, located on the 19th and 20th floors of 465 Park Avenue.\nHearst, whose tumultuous personal and professional life inspired Orson Welles\u2019 1941 film \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d purchased the Ritz Tower \u2014 then an apartment hotel \u2014 in the late 1920s.

Even the home\u2019s doors are historic, Kotler said, hearkening from a 16th-century monastery.\nThe museum-like quality of the home extends to many of the furnishings included in the $26 million listing price, including a 100-year-old Agra carpet, Recency-era tables and a 10-foot Vanderbilt clock.\nA balcony with Central Park views, accessed from the walnut-paneled library, wraps around the north, south and west sides of the co-op.\nResidents at 465 Park Avenue enjoy hotel-style services, including housekeeping and room service.\nHearst eventually lived with Davies in the Ritz Tower home in the 1930s, according to \u201cMansions in the Clouds: The Skyscraper Palazzi of Emery Roth,\u201d by Steven Ruttenbaum.

        "hed": "Most Mass. voters want more housing, poll finds",
        "subhead": "Vocal opposition may be a minority, advocates say",
        "content": "Massachusetts is well known for its local opposition to new housing efforts. Local resistance to a state law mandating towns make it easier to build apartments in the suburbs has been intense. Local resident groups frequently dub proposed developments in their neighborhoods scary nicknames like \u201cThe Monster Project\u201d and \u201cThe Weston Whopper,\u201d depicting them as skyscrapers towering over quaint single-family homes. But those loud opponents may actually be in the minority. A new poll this week from MassINC, commissioned by the pro-housing group Abundant Housing Massachusetts, found that the majority of the state\u2019s voters actually support new housing development, favoring it over other considerations like preserving the character of neighborhoods. More than 90 percent of the 803 voters MassINC surveyed in March identified the cost of housing here as a problem, and 71 percent said they would prioritize building more homes that people can afford over preserving the character of neighborhoods. Some 57 percent of respondents said the cost of homeownership and renting in their own communities is \u201ca big problem,\u201d and 75 percent said there are not enough homes in Massachusetts that the average person can buy or rent.\u201cThis survey shows that the loud opposition that often show up at local planning meetings are actually a minority,\u201d said Richard Parr, senior research director at The MassINC Polling Group. \u201cMost people, when presented with practical solutions, seem ready to say yes to more housing.\u201dRelated: The YIMBYs are coming, to the suburbsAdvertisementThe poll, said Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director of Abundant Housing, indicates that the extreme cost of housing in the state \u2014 the median-priced single-family home in Greater Boston sold for $930,000 in March \u2014 has become the most pressing issue for everyday people in Massachusetts, so much so that more people are becoming supportive of solutions that may feel uncomfortable. AdvertisementAn apartment building under construction in Lynn in 2023.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIts a welcome sign for housing advocates, who argue the state needs to compel cities and towns to build more. Massachusetts has not built enough housing over the last couple of decades to keep up with the state\u2019s growing population, and the Healey Administration earlier this year established a target of 222,000 new homes by 2035. But in a state where local governments retain a strong hand in land-use decisions, reaching that goal that will almost certainly require buy-in from cities and towns. The majority of people surveyed by MassINC said they would support efforts to increase new development near public transit, as well as allowing homes to be built on smaller patches of land. Most also said they would support allowing smaller multifamily buildings like triple-deckers in their neighborhoods.The results of the poll may sound contradictory because opposition to new housing is loud in many communities. But it aligns with research conducted by Boston University professors in the late 2010s that found that the people who attend meetings for proposed development are disproportionately white, older, male and homeowners. Those opponents may not necessarily be representative of the community at large, the BU research found. And even so, the majority of the voters surveyed by MassINC said they lived in a single-family home. Support for new housing development was highest among renters, non-white voters, parents, and people under the age of 45.AdvertisementThe poll, said Kanson-Benanav, should serve as evidence for the Legislature to pass more policies that encourage development. Several legislators have recently introduced bills that would reduce the scope of the MBTA Communities Act, the law that requires towns to zone for more housing. And two recently announced Republican candidates who plan to run against Governor Maura Healey have criticized the administration for its approach to enforcing the law, with one, former MBTA executive Brian Shortsleeve, saying he would push the Legislature to repeal it. \u201cAcross the Commonwealth, voters want more housing solutions that create an abundance of housing opportunities for families, renters, and longtime homeowners alike,\u201d said Kanson-Benanav. \u201cThey\u2019re telling lawmakers: say yes to homes \u2014 and yes to the future of Massachusetts by passing reforms that will build more homes for everyday residents.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "content": "This pedigreed Gilded Age townhome just got a handsome price cut.\nThe 10,300-square-foot residence right off Central Park is not only the former home of Italy\u2019s United Nations ambassador but also the one-time property of both Calvin Klein and the Gucci family.\nThe listing, first reportedby Mansion Globalin March, is newly priced at $16 million \u2013 a $3.5 million price reduction.\nThe impressive listing was recently entrusted to George Vanderploeg and Stuart Brannan of Douglas Elliman in February, according to StreetEasy. Vanderploeg told The Post that the current owners, due to regulations, had to initially price and list the property on their own.\nThe Italian government purchased the pad in 1991 from none other than fashion mogul Calvin Klein, who acquired the home just three years prior, according to city records. Before him, a company associated with the Gucci family held the deed.\nThe 1902 brick and limestone neo-Georgian spans six levels and boasts an impressive depth of 77 feet. The townhome features quintessential details of the Gilded Age kept lovingly intact by its numerous stewards \u2013 13-foot ceilings, ornate fireplaces and a grand staircase.\nThe home\u2019s entrance gives way to a grand entrance hall connected to a large living room and a dining room with seats for 16.\u00a0The back patio and garden area, accessed from the parlor floor kitchen, spans 250 square feet, Vanderploeg said.\nVanderploeg compared the home\u2019s tall ceilings to an Italian palazzo\u2019s grandpiano nobile, or principal floor.\nThe upper floors include a wood-paneled library with one of the home\u2019s eight wood-burning fireplaces and a primary bedroom with two large dressing rooms.\nThe property features six bedrooms, including two staff rooms in the 1,693-square-foot basement.\nThe fifth-floor penthouse suite, which encompasses a bedroom and a loft-like living room lit by a skylight, boasts access to a 1,600-square-foot rooftop, according to the listing.\nVanderploeg said the most recent owners of the home made relatively few changes, but the home\u2019s three kitchens were redone to facilitate catering for large parties.\nAdvertisement",

The new price tags are a dramatic leap from the original estimate of $15.92 million.\nThe triplexes will reportedly be sold by the British auction house Sotheby\u2019s.\nAyrton Senna was a three-time world racing champion widely thought of as one of the greatest drivers in history. He achieved six Monaco Grand Prix victories, but tragically died at the age of 34 \u2014\u00a0during 1994\u2019s San Marino Grand Prix.\nHis own niece, artist Lalalli Senna, helped craft the tower\u2019s design, which is reportedly intended to symbolize the motor sports icon\u2019s journey of overcoming challenges.\nSenna Tower is being built to contain 228 units in total, including 204 apartments up to 4,300 square feet and 18 suspended \u2018mansions,\u2019 spanning 4,520 to 6,060 square feet. Even the tower\u2019s tiniest residences will start around $5 million.\nFour duplexes, each about 6,450 square feet, will also be on offer.\nThe project is a collaboration between the construction company FG Empreendimentos, the Senna family, and Brazilian retailer Havan. The estimated investment totals more than $525 million.\nConstruction is expected to be completed by 2033.\nSenna Tower will join an already sizeable skyline in Balne\u00e1rio Cambori\u00fa, known as the Dubai of Brazil. Located in the the state of Santa Catarina, it has a strong reputation in South America as a desirable tourist destination.\nAnd while the forthcoming project will set its share of records, the world\u2019s most expensive apartment is currently in Monaco. There, the penthouse inside the exclusive European enclave\u2019s Odeon Tower last sold for more than $335 million.\nAdvertisement",

The staircase visually and physically connects all three levels, while floor-to-ceiling windows usher in light and views from every direction.\nThe first level includes a 52-foot-long great room anchored by a gas fireplace with a custom stone hearth, a high-end chef\u2019s kitchen appointed with Italian milk glass and eucalyptus wood cabinetry, and access to a landscaped terrace fitted with Ando-designed water walls and reflecting pools.\nUpstairs, the bedroom suites are upholstered with sound-dampening fabric for added privacy, and the primary suite includes a private covered balcony, a dressing room, and a walk-in closet. The en-suite bathrooms are clad in Bianco Sivec marble with glacier-white Corian vanities and wall-mounted fixtures.\nAtop the residence, a full-floor roof terrace offers views of the Empire State Building, One World Trade Center, and the Williamsburg Bridge. The space is outfitted with a full outdoor kitchen, a carved granite soaking tub, and yet another reflecting pool\u2014this one wrapping around a granite fireplace custom-designed by Ando.\nAmong the rarest features for a Manhattan apartment are the two on-site automated valet parking spaces and private storage, which come with the unit \u2014 amenities virtually unheard of in Nolita, or anywhere below 14th Street.\nThe building includes just seven residences and features a full-time doorman, 24-hour concierge service, and a level of discretion often reserved for uptown ultra-luxury towers.\nAdam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg of the Modlin Group hold the listing.\nThough known for his deeply meditative concrete structures and poetic spatial language, Ando has only designed a handful of private residences in the United States.\nIn 2023, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z made headlines when they paid $200 million for a Malibu oceanfront compound designed by Ando, setting a California real estate record.\nIn contrast, Kanye West purchased a separate Ando-designed home in Malibu for $57.3 million\u2014only to strip it to its bones and leave it unfinished. That property returned to the market this spring with a gutted interior and a steep drop in value, drawing criticism from architecture purists and fans of Ando alike.\nAdvertisement",

The vehicle, known for its rugged styling and cult-like following, underscores the seller\u2019s playful, all-in approach to marketing the home.\nDescribed in marketing materials as \u201ca chic Hamptons traditional,\u201d the home blends architectural charm with modern convenience. \u201cThis checks all the boxes for that perfect Hamptons home with all the amenities and a great price,\u201d the listing declared.\nIn the wider Water Mill market, recent data reveals a complex picture.\nWhile the median list price in April 2025 stood at $5.9 million \u2014 up 34.2% year-over-year \u2014 sales activity has been uneven, according to data sourced fromRedfin.\nThe median sale price for homes in the area was $8 million in January 2025, marking a 176.7% increase from the previous year. However, homes are taking longer to sell, with an average of 161 days on the market, and many are selling below asking price.\nThis suggests that while demand for luxury properties remains strong, buyers are becoming more selective, and pricing strategies are crucial for sellers aiming to close deals in this competitive environment.\nAdvertisement",

Perfect,\u201d share another.\nIt\u2019s clear that the rental\u2019s runaway popularity isn\u2019t because of the nearby historic riverfront, nor its convenient proximity to Portland. The home\u2019s owner appears to have put their heart and soul into making the rental a dream come true for \u201cTwilight\u201d diehards.\nThe house, which Bella shared with her divorced police-chief father, Charlie, played by Billy Burke, is filled with memorabilia from the films.\nGuests can enjoy dinner at Charlie Swan\u2019s actual dining table, where he cocked his shotgun before meeting his daughter\u2019s vampiric date. They can sleep in Bella\u2019s moody teenage bedroom, where Edward spent long, creepy nights watching her sleep. The listing photos boast movie-accurate purple floral bedding and even recreations of wall art just barely glimpsed in background shots of the film.\nUpstairs, a \u201clookout\u201d room window overlooks the front yard \u2014 the same window through which Bella spied Edward parked with his shiny silver Volvo.\nThe rental even caters to members of \u201cTeam Jacob.\u201d A downstairs bedroom, dubbed the \u201cJacob Black guest room,\u201d featuring a cardboard cutout of \u201cNew Moon\u201d-era Jacob, played by Taylor Lautner.\nUnfortunately for all of the \u201cTwihards\u201d out there, the rental comes with a huge catch. The \u2018\u2019Twilight Swan House\u201d appears to be booked out on Airbnb until April 2027.\nAdvertisement",

Lauve\u2019s firm, Workshop Studio, builds lounge-like mailrooms with sofas, wood panelling and moody lighting.\nLauve called one such mailroom \u201can extension of the lobby,\u201d rather than leaving the space \u201can afterthought and tucked away.\u201d\nIn a time when apartment dwellers can furnish their entire homes via online shopping, it\u2019s no wonder that mailrooms are getting more attention.\nNot only do these spaces require more high-tech security to house mountains of precious parcels \u2013 Amazon lockers, key-coded doors and surveillance cameras \u2013 they simply require more space.\nRemote work is also influencing the future of mailrooms. The post-pandemic surge in remote work has motivated multifamily residences to offer lonely desk jockeys spaces outside of their apartments to work.\nSuch spaces have few requirements \u2014 a smooth tabletop, free wifi, an outlet and maybe some natural light. Designers like Lauve ask, why can\u2019t such spaces be found in the mailroom?\nRegardless of whether a building wants to cater to more creative uses of the mailroom, growing the footprint of these overlooked rooms is becoming a regulatory necessity.\nSheena Brittingham, a managing partner at a Portland-based design firm, told Fast Company that housing code changes are further pushing the evolution of these neglected rooms.\nRecent revisions to the Americans with Disabilities Act and enhanced turning radius requirements in common areas have necessitated the expansion of even the most standard of mailrooms, the outlet reported.\nIn addition to allocating more space, updated postal laws are compelling new residential properties to build these spaces in more visible, highly trafficked areas.\nUnited States Postal Service standards revised in 2020 require multifamily buildings to place their mailrooms within a reasonable distance of where the mail courier parks their delivery vehicle, Fast Company reported.\nAs a consequence of its encroachment, the mailroom now demands the same aesthetic attention as the lobby.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to feel like you\u2019re going down some creepy corridor to get your stuff,\u201d Brittingham told the outlet.\nAdvertisement",

Still, the building\u2019s recognizable fa\u00e7ade and Tiffany Blue door have made it one of the most iconic movie homes in New York.\n\u201c169 East 71st Street is the original \u2018Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u2019 home, immortalized by Audrey Hepburn and woven into the fabric of New York\u2019s cultural legacy,\u201d said Caroline Bass of The Corcoran Group, the home\u2019s listing agent.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a townhouse \u2014 it\u2019s a piece of cinematic history.\u201d\nSet on one of the Upper East Side\u2019s most postcard-perfect, tree-lined blocks between Lexington and Third Avenues, the property spans approximately 4,465 square feet and features a landscaped 30-foot garden, two setback terraces, and a south-facing Juliet balcony.\nInside, the layout includes four bedrooms, four full bathrooms and three powder rooms. Architectural flourishes abound: soaring ceilings over 10 feet, white oak herringbone floors with ebony inlay, antique mantels, and two gas fireplaces.\n\u201cThe owners didn\u2019t just enhance the home; they transformed it \u2014 adding a full-size elevator servicing all levels, excavating the basement to create a wine cellar/tasting room and constructing an entirely new floor crowned by a southern terrace,\u201d Bass said.\n\u201cOver the course of three years, this historic townhouse underwent a meticulous, no-expense-spared renovation \u2014 honoring its 19th-century architecture while seamlessly integrating modern luxury.\u201d\nNow a two-family residence, the home includes a garden-level apartment with its own private entrance, den, bedroom and open kitchen with stainless steel appliances and banquette dining. French doors lead to a 466-square-foot garden with custom Walpole lattice fencing.\nThe parlor floor showcases dramatic period millwork, beamed ceilings, burnished silver leaf details, and designer lighting from Porta Romana.\nA concealed television is tucked behind a hand-pieced antique mirror above the fireplace.

The ensuite bath features Calacatta Gold Damask-patterned marble, a walk-in shower, and a soaking tub with a polished nickel finish by Crosswater London.\nThe fifth floor serves as a flexible den or entertaining space with a wet bar, wine fridge, and access to a 123-square-foot southern terrace.\nBelow ground, the nearly eight-foot-high basement includes mechanicals, cold storage, a second laundry room and a dedicated wine cellar outfitted with twin Liebherr fridges, built-in benches and a tasting sink.\nRetired beverage executive and entrepreneur Joseph Harkins, the home\u2019s current owner and former head of Red Hook Distributing Corp. and Le Tourment Vert absinthe, oversaw the property\u2019s transformation.\n\u201cThe house has great karma,\u201d Harkins said, \u201cand our only hope is that the next owner enjoys it as much as my family has.\u201d\nBass purchased the home back in 2015 for $7.4 million, records show.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find townhouses all over the Upper East Side \u2014 but none like this,\u201d added Bass.\n\u201cWith three outdoor spaces, an elevator, a landscaped garden, and architectural provenance tied to an American film classic, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own an icon.\u201d\nOr, as the listing description puts it: \u201cThey say you can\u2019t buy history.

Related: Want to live in a converted office tower? Boston has high hopes for its high rises.The Boston Planning and Development Agency board has approved plans to convert the downtown offices into a combined 175 apartments \u2014 80 at 15 Court Square, and 95 at 85 Devonshire St. But the projects, which KS estimates would cost a combined $65 million, will need more equity financing to become a reality. AdvertisementKS Partners\u2019 business is primarily commercial property, rather than housing, and so the firm is looking to bring in a residential expert to assist with \u2014 and help pay for \u2014 the conversion, said Biria St. John, vice chairman of CBRE\u2019s multifamily capital markets team in Boston. What\u2019s more, he said, managing and operating the future apartment buildings together will make the project more cost-efficient.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a sizable project that requires a fair amount of equity,\u201d St. John said. \u201cIt takes the same amount to market an 85-unit building as it does to market a 150-unit building. It really makes the economics that much more attractive when you have scale.\u201d The properties\u2019 highlights include 16,500 square feet of \u201cfully occupied prime retail space\u201d in Downtown Crossing at the 85 Devonshire St./262 Washington St. space, along with \u201cstrong market trends\u201d and an \u201cexcellent transit-oriented location with 24/7 urban lifestyle,\u201d the CBRE marketing brochure said.

Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffThe brochure highlights some $23 million worth of city property-tax breaks for the \u201c175 unit portfolio, adding that the team \u201cwill be conducting tours over the next several weeks\u201d for interested investors.In 2023, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu launched a program offering generous tax breaks for residential conversions \u2014 a reduction of up to 75 percent of the residential tax rate, which is already substantially lower than commercial rates, for up to 29 years \u2014 to help encourage these sort of projects.Since the launch, the city has received some 15 applications to create 762 housing units across 20 different buildings, the Planning Department recently told the Boston City Council.Spatial constraints and the costs associated with conversion have proved challenging, and financial incentives are still necessary, Planning Director Kairos Shen told councilors at a hearing May 12.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Shen said. \u201cConverting, let\u2019s say, underused office spaces to residential is still a program that requires the incentive that the program has built in.\u201d Beyond the city tax credits, KS is applying for federal historic tax credits and is planning to seek state historic tax credits as well, St. John said. The credits are an important piece of the developments\u2019 financial puzzle, especially given high construction costs these days, he said. New building code requirements such as Boston\u2019s Net Zero Carbon Zoning Initiative and the state specialized stretch energy code have made development projects difficult to afford.Advertisement\u201cSometimes it\u2019s as expensive to convert a building as it is to do a ground-up\u201d project, St. John said. Still, the broker said, the project has received \u201cvery good engagement\u201d from interested investors so far, though he declined to name them.Selling a property that\u2019s already obtained city approvals for redevelopment is a boon for potential partners, said Mark Fallon, director of research and strategy at brokerage Hunneman in Boston.\u201cThat\u2019s a huge value-add,\u201d Fallon said. However, Fallon noted, any redevelopment would still need to make financial sense for a prospective buyer. \u201cThe same issue everyone is running into is: \u2018can we pencil this out?\u2019\u201d Fallon said. \u201cPeople are still worried about construction costs, cost overruns, labor shortages, interest-rate policy.

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "By Spencer Buell, The Boston Globe\n\nThe owners of an historic 66-unit Cambridge condo building, whohad to flee it in a hurrylast year amid concerns it might collapse, are planning to demolish their home along the Charles.\n\nThe process is anticipated to begin in the months ahead, according to a statement from the company that manages the property. A formal vote to demolish hasn\u2019t yet been taken, and it was not immediately clear when, exactly, the building would be taken down.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Trustees is planning for the demolition of the Riverview Building,\u201d said Thayer & Associates, the company that manages the Riverview complex, in a statement. \u201cConversations continue among the residents about the future sale of the Riverview property.\u201d\n\nThe plan would likelyalsorequire residents of the adjacent Bradbury building, who have remained in their homes even as their neighbors evacuated, to leave, the statement said.\n\n\n\nThe 14-unit building shares utilities with the larger Riverview building. Those utilities will will need to be disconnected as part of the demolition, Thayer & Associates said.\n\nMany Bradbury residents would like to return, but whether they could do so would depend on the terms of a hoped-for sale to a developer, the details of which still need to be worked out, condo owners familiar with the plans said.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy is, you have these 14 perfectly good units that can only be made usable by putting utilities in,\u201d said Linda Salter, an owner who said she has had a unit in Riverview for more than 50 years. \u201cOnce you start taking down the building, they\u2019re stranded on an island without electricity, heat, hot water.\u201d\n\nMany of Riverview\u2019s residents were senior citizens whohad planned to age in place in their homes overlooking the Charles River. Their lives were upended last year, when building leadership opted to evacuate the striking white-concrete building, which was built in the early 1960s.\n\nThe move came after a construction crew in 2023 discovered longstanding structural issues with \u201csubstandard concrete\u201d and improperly placed rebar, which appeared to date back to when it was built, the property management company said last year. Further tests found even day-to-day use of the building might overload the concrete, the company has said.\n\nThe last residents left the building at the end of December, the Globe has previously reported.\n\nInitially they had hoped they would need to leave their homes only temporarily while new supports were added to the building, but eventually came to believe thatdemolition was the only viable option.\n\nStill, many former residents remain thankful the decision to leave came before anyone was harmed, and that they can begin this next chapter with their health.\n\n\u201cI think we need to be glass-half-full,\u201d said Salter. \u201cI\u2019m old, but I\u2019m very vital. I played three-and-a-half hours of pickleball yesterday. I plan to live and enjoy my life to the fullest every minute and every day that I have. That I can do and that I plan to do. That\u2018s all that matters now.\u201d\n\nCambridge officials have said that the evacuation last year was not ordered by the city, but that the city supported the decision to leave.\n\nA city spokesperson said on Thursday that Cambridge had not yet received an application to demolish the Mt. Auburn Street building.\n\nThe Riverview ordeal has carried, and will carry, a financial weight. If and when the property does sell, owners expect to recoup a small fraction of what they paid for their units, some of which in recent years soldfor millions of dollars.\n\nIn the meantime, they have said they have had to pay taxes and condo fees, as well for heat and electricity in the dormant building, and other expenses related to the handling of the aftermath of the evacuation.\n\nWhile they said they will be sad to see it go, many are eager just to move on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2018s both heartbreaking and fabulous that we\u2019re going ahead with this,\u201d said Judy Foreman, who has owned a unit in Riverview for a decade and is a former Boston Globe health columnist. \u201cIt\u2018s a wonderful building and we all loved it. But it\u2018s time to demolish it.\u201d\n\nBe civil.  Be kind.\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

The fantastical dream of Germany\u2019s Neuschwanstein Castle found a devotee in the late Deon Heiner, whose Wyoming castle hit the market in April 2024.\nHeiner\u2019s extravagant home, first priced at $14 million, is newly available for $13.5 million,Mansion Global reported.\nThe 9,470-square-foot castle, located in Bedford, Wyoming, comes with towers, turrets, ramparts and lookouts worthy of a princess.\nHeiner, a businessman in the construction industry, built the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom brick castle in 1992. Just the process of laying the 1 million bricks was necessary to build up the original home took eight years,according to Cowboy State Daily.\nThe castle, which Heiner reportedly modeled after Neuschwanstein Castle, has all the dressings of a royal seat \u2013 turrets on the corners, stone balconies, cast-iron windows and vaulted ceilings. There\u2019s even an underground tunnel system with secret entrances, according to the listing.\nThe tallest turret, accessed by a stainless steel spiral staircase, reaches 100 feet into the air, offering 360-degree views of rural forest and mountains.\nThe property\u2019s listing agent, Patty Speakman of Compass, told The Post that she imagines the home\u2019s next owner will enjoy its relative seclusion, unique architecture and sweeping vistas.\n\u201cIt sits on the top of the hill, and you\u2019ve got views in every direction,\u201d Speakman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a beautiful location.\u201d\nDespite the exterior\u2019s romantic design, the estate\u2019s 40 rooms enjoy the benefit of modern amenities, like large windows that let in ample light and imported stone floors with in-floor heating.\nThere\u2019s also a secure vault room, a rampart greenhouse, a game room and a gym.\nThe 37 wooded acres upon which the castle sits include walking and biking trails, according to the listing, and a brick perimeter encloses the expansive grounds.\nShould the castle\u2019s next owner find themselves unable to traverse the property\u2019s facsimile moat, they can always access the home in one other way \u2014 via its helipad.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Locals in West Orange, NJ aren\u2019t just shouting from the rooftops \u2014 they\u2019re shouting about what might be built above them.\nA billionaire\u2019s bid to transform a pristine hilltop with Manhattan skyline views into a nearly 500-unit apartment complex is the latest drama in a decades-old land use battle in the tony town \u2014 and this time, the argument involves affordable housing.\nOwned by the family of Minnesota Vikings co-owner Zygmunt \u201cZygi\u201d Wilf, the 120-acre wooded parcel in the Watchung Mountains will be developed by Wilf\u2019s Garden Homes, a real estate firm,NJ.comreported.\nBesides clearing roughly 30 acres of woodland, the developer\u2019s vision includes a four-building, four-story complex with amenities like a clubhouse and pool. Of the 496 units, 100 are designated as affordable housing.\nWhile the plan goes to help satisfy the township\u2019s state-mandated housing obligations, locals say the environmental and public safety risks are simply too steep.\n\u201cPublic safety and irreparable environmental harm trump, if you will, affordable housing,\u201d said Joseph Pannullo, president of grassroots group We Care NJ, in an interview with NJ.com.\nThe roots of the current plan trace back to New Jersey\u2019s controversial Mount Laurel Doctrine \u2014 a series of court rulings requiring municipalities to provide their fair share of affordable housing.\nWest Orange, like many other towns, has faced pressure to comply.\nThe saga began back in 2006, when the Wilf\u2019s proposed a less inclusive project for the property, which was rejected over similar concerns \u2014 including flooding, steep slopes, and limited emergency access.\nFinally, in 2020, local officials struck a court-approved deal with developers \u2014 Garden Homes got the go-ahead, so long as it introduced an affordable component that helped the town meet its mandate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation where the law is very coercive from a municipality\u2019s point of view,\u201d West Orange Council President Joe Krakoviak toldRealtor.com.\u201cMunicipalities\u2019 hands are very much tied because they have little, if any, influence over how many units of affordable housing to approve.\u201d\nDespite the legal issues, Krakoviak has remained outspoken in his skepticism of the Wilf proposal, citing the project\u2019s remote location and complex terrain.\n\u201cI have a tremendous amount of concern about the environmental ramifications of this proposal, as well as the appropriateness of placing lower-income residents in the proposal so far away from all of the things they need to reach,\u201d he said to Realtor.com, noting distance from public transit and basic services.\nThe project has already cleared several regulatory hurdles, including receiving a stormwater permit from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.\nOpposition is mounting, however.\nIn July, the West Orange Environmental Commission asked for a delay in site plan review, raising red flags over potential damage to state-protected wetlands and two tributaries of the Canoe Brook.\nA November report by environmental consulting firm Princeton Hydro also stated that the site plans did not comply with state stormwater regulations, according to NJ.com.\nRachel Klein, a local resident and We Care NJ member, accused the developers of using affordable housing as a \u201cguise\u201d to push through a plan that has previously been deemed unsafe.\n\u201c[They] thought we\u2019d be afraid of being accused of NIMBYism,\u201d she told Realtor.com. \u201cIf it was unsafe for 136 homes that would have been worth $1 million at the time, why is suddenly throwing poor people into it making it safe? That makes no sense to us.\u201d\nKlein, who has lived near the mountain since 2016, emphasized that her objection is not to affordable housing itself, but to the placement.\n\u201cThe need is there, for sure, and the town is working on it. But the problem is West Orange is already exceedingly overdeveloped,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just not the appropriate place for it.\u201d\nAs part of the plan, the remaining undeveloped acreage would be preserved as green space and recreational trails, and developers have proposed replanting trees lost to construction. But critics remain unconvinced that mitigation measures can reverse the impact of clear-cutting a mature forest.\nAccording to Realtor.com, the median list price in the surrounding area is $599,725, underscoring the contrast between market-rate housing and the proposed affordable component.\nWhile Garden Homes has not commented publicly, the township planning board is still reviewing site plans, with the next public hearing scheduled for Wednesday.\nFor now, the mountaintop remains a flashpoint \u2014 caught between the urgent need for affordable housing and the equally pressing calls to preserve what locals see as one of the last untouched natural spaces in Essex County.\n\u201cI fully expect opposition to the project to grow well beyond the board\u2019s decision,\u201d Krakoviak told NJ.com.\nAdvertisement",

It wasn\u2019t necessary. They left already. We\u2019re just chasing them for the approximately $5 million that was owed.\u201d\nAccording to court filings, Centaur Properties apparently forgave more than $5 million in rent during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 in an effort to give the show financial breathing room.\nBut after the theatrical experience resumed and reportedly became profitable again, Centaur alleges the production once again defaulted in 2023, accruing an additional $4.5 million in rent arrears before closing the show for good.\nThe legal battle began in February 2024 \u2014\u00a0when Centaur sued Karpati and Hochwald as personal guarantors of the lease.\nIn response, the duo countersued Centaur and several of its representatives, claiming they were fraudulently coerced into signing the lease amendment that had previously wiped the slate clean.\nThe tenant\u2019s complaint alleged a range of wrongdoing \u2014 but the court rejected these claims.\n\u201cThis dispute is not about principle but about principal,\u201d brothers Terrence and Darren Oved said in an earlier statement.\n\u201cPDNYC\u2019s [who the show\u2019s producers operate under] complaint is a baseless, misguided and transparent attempt to avoid its obligation to pay over $4 million in past due rent.\u201d\nIn its ruling, issued Friday, May 16, the court dismissed all counterclaims brought by Karpati and Hochwald and found them jointly liable for the amounts owed under the lease, including attorney\u2019s fees.\n\u201cWe are grateful for the court\u2019s swift and sound dismissal of the baseless allegations against our clients,\u201d the attorneys said in a statement following the decision.\n\u201cHarlan Berger and Centaur have acted with utmost integrity throughout this drama. \u2018Sleep No More\u2019 will find neither sleep nor slumber until its substantial financial obligations to our client have been fulfilled.\u201d\nAccording to Oved, the decision to vacate the premises was a strategic one, likely made to limit further damage.\n\u201cThey started realizing that it was closing in on them more,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we told them that the longer they stay there, the longer our damages are gonna be accruing. So they left in a desperate attempt to try to shut their damages.\u201d\nThe show\u2019s producers declined to comment.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "An Idaho family is on the adventure of a lifetime after selling everything they own in order toexplore the high seas.\nDespite never having sailed before,Brandon and Amber Morseand their children now live on a catamaran in the Caribbean.\nAnd while it hasn\u2019t always been easy, they say the experience has changed them all for the better.\nThefamilytellsRealtor.com\u00aewhy they\u2019ve chosen tolive life a little differently.\nIn 2020, the Morses were a typical family living inIdahowith both parents working full-time jobs and a busy schedule of educational and extracurricular activities for their four kids. However, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic that the family first started toying with the idea of \u201cescaping\u201d their normal.\n\u201cI was working as a nurse at the time, so there was an incredible amount of stress that I was carrying around. Plus, we were also just generally fed up with the 9-to-5 grind\u2014it felt like it was stealing the single most important thing we have in this life, our time, especially from our kids,\u201d says Amber.\n\u201cWe felt like we were kissing them to bed each night only to send them out the door in the morning notreallyseeing them until the next bedtime kiss.\u201d\nSo, the couple first started talking about what life would be like if they quit their jobs, sold one of their cars, rented out their home fully furnished, homeschooled the kids\u2014and then packed everyone into an RV to travel the country.\nThey then turned it into a reality.\n\u201cWhen we were three months into our RV trip, we started thinking about going back to the\u00a0statusquo \u2026 and it almost felt like a waste because it had taken so much work to cut ties with our former lives,\u201d says Amber.\nIt was Amber and Brandon\u2019s eldest daughter,\u00a0Jadyn, who actually started the sailing conversation because she\u2019d had a middle school friend whose family had done it for a few weeks.\nThey found themselves \u201cdown a rabbit hole into YouTube and finding families that were living full time on their sailboats, sailing the world.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is\u00a0courage begets\u00a0courage, and it was only because of the baby steps it took to go RVing that we could even see ourselves doing something else,\u201d says Amber.\nThe Morses had purchased their Idaho home only nine months before their pandemic-year RV trip.\nThe five-bedroom home with a pond in the back and a neighborhood pool on their cul-de-sac was the largest home they\u2019d ever owned.\n\u201cNicer cars, a nicer house\u2014none of it felt fulfilling,\u201d says Amber. \u201cI kept dreaming of being able to travel with our kids and experience adventures that really stretched us beyond our comfort zone.\n\u201cWe knew that we\u2019d need the equity from our house in order to afford a type of sailboat that could fit six people comfortably,\u201d says Amber.\nThey put their home on the market and sold it in three weeks.\nThe next step\u2014aside from sending Brandon to sailing school\u2014was to buy a boat.\n\u201cBoats are like houses in the sense that you can find a boat that matches your budget\u2014from trailer park style to super yacht,\u201d says Brandon. \u201cFor us, since we knew we were using our equity in our home to purchase a depreciating asset, we wanted to go for a used boat, since most of the depreciation happens in the first five years.\u201d\nHowever, they also knew they\u2019d need a boat that was big enough to comfortably \u201chouse\u201d a family of six.\nUltimately they chose aLagoon 450, which is a four-cabin model, with each cabin having its own bathroom and shower.\n\u201cFor our family of six, this felt like a size that we could manage for sailing but also for living spaces for the family,\u201d says Brandon.\n\u201cSince the older kids all have their own cabins, they get to have their privacy and they can treat it like their room, so they brought the things that felt most special with them,\u201d says Amber. \u201cBrandon and I also have our own cabin, and thankfully, we all have locking doors.\u201d\nAlong with the four cabins, they have a main \u201csaloon\u201d area that includes the galley (kitchen), navigation desk, and their \u201cliving room\u201d\u2014which houses an L-shaped couch. There is also a cockpit area that holds a dining table and additional seating. The boat\u2019s flybridge (an elevated deck and observation point) is on the upper deck and includes a lounge pad plus seating for eight people.\nFiguring out how to make their new lifestyle work took financial planning, especially since Brandon and Amber quit their jobs. However, by being entrepreneurial and sustainable, they\u2019re coming out ahead.\nTo begin with, the Morses used the money from their home sale to pay cash for their catamaran, which eliminated a mortgage payment, property taxes, and utility bills.\nNow their only \u201cutility bill\u201d is diesel for the boat engines and generator, but they can go months without having to \u201cfill up.\u201d Brandon also installed a massive solar charging system that charges a large battery bank, which allows the family to live off grid.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go into marinas, and we rarely have to run our generator,\u201d says Amber. \u201cWe do everything with free solar power\u2014from cooking, to making water with our saltwater desalination water maker, to running our water heater.\u201d\nFor money, in addition to living off their savings for a while, they also rent out a duplex they own.\nMore recently, they\u2019ve started getting content creation work from a few companies and brands (thanks to their largeInstagram,TikTok, andYouTubefollowings), and they have anAmazon pagefor \u201cessential items for boat life\u201d from which they earn a little commission.\n\u201cCooking in a small galley has its challenges, but I also didn\u2019t realize how much I would enjoy using whatever resources we have on hand as a creative outlet,\u201d says Amber. \u201cI even took upmaking sourdough breadfor the first time, and actually before boat life, I had never made bread in my entire life.\u201d\nAmber says there is also something truly magical\u2014almost like a \u201creclaiming\u201d\u2014that has happened with having the time to make homemade food and then sit around their back table eating it together as a family.\n\u201cThis is quite the contrast to the busy life we used to live on land, eating granola bars in the car, going from one activity to the next,\u201d she adds.\nWhile their lives are definitely picturesque, the Morses say that, just like life on land, they have good days and bad days on the boat.\n\u201cSomething that we learned very quickly is that all the romantic moments are earned,\u201d says Amber. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work maintaining and managing a self-sustaining, floating city.\u201d\nAll the boat\u2019s operating systems are rather complex, and Brandon has to oversee two large diesel engines and a generator.\n\u201cWhen a system isn\u2019t working correctly, it can completely put a damper on our living situation,\u201d says Brandon.\nPlus, there are weather issues with which to contend.\n\u201cOur lives are completely dictated by it,\u201d says Brandon. \u201cWe\u2019ve now weathered several tropical storms and had to outrun hurricanes.\u201d\nBut on the flip side, their days are filled with wonder and new experiences. Mornings usually begin with a snorkel, and the kids\u2014now aged 19, 14 (the twins), and 8\u2014have made friends from all over the world.\n\u201cEven though the ocean was so foreign to us, it\u2019s provided us with some of the most magical moments I could ever fathom as a family,\u201d says Amber.\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s no land in sight and you have a pod of dolphins playfully swimming at your bow\u2014how can that be topped? The ocean has truly changed us, and living on a boat has changed us.\n\u201cWhen you cast the dock lines, you\u2019re leaving all the conveniences of land and trading them for potentially the hardest thing you will ever do.\n\u201cBut the coolest thing\u2014after four years, 15,000 nautical miles, and 21 different countries\u2014our kids have grown so much and built character in ways they never would have if we\u2019d just stayed in our little cul-de-sac.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

But when the housing market is frozen \u2014 as in, homes aren\u2019t changing hands between buyers and sellers \u2014 it makes the problem worse because all of the demand for homes in the region is focused on the few properties that do go up for sale, driving prices even higher.An open house in Milton last summer.Debee TlumackiFrom April 2024 to April 2025, single-family home prices in the region rose 4.3 percent, according to GBAR. Condominium prices in Greater Boston rose last month, too, with the median-priced unit selling for $732,000, 4.4 percent more than the same month last year. Single-family home prices rose statewide as well, according to The Warren Group, a local real estate analytics firm, to a median of $630,000, up about 3.3 percent from April 2024. Those price increases are partially driven by a broad slowdown in the market over the last three years. Interest rates, which began to rise in late 2021, have sidelined many sellers because they do not want to owe a higher monthly payment on a new house. Rates have sidelined buyers, too, because there are so few options to choose from, and the homes that are available come with both high up front costs and those high monthly payments. Related: If so many people are leaving Massachusetts, why aren\u2019t housing costs going down?The average on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.81 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, more than double the average in 2021 and translating directly to higher monthly mortgage payments. So the fact that listings jumped last month is a welcome sign. Still, home sales were down both in Greater Boston and statewide in April compared to April 2024, so its not clear that the housing market is on track to come roaring back to life. Interest rates are still high, and additional uncertainty about the economy is also sidelining buyers.

        "content": "A Brooklyn couple ready to tie the knot in June are approaching their wedding registry with an unconventional option for friends and family.\n\u201cSince we\u2019re having a destination wedding, minimizing physical gifts makes things simpler, and not everyone feels drawn to contribute to a honeymoon,\u201d says\u00a0Eliza Palasz.\nPalasz and her fianc\u00e9,\u00a0Patrick Rooney, have planned a summer wedding in Canada. Their registry, which includes traditional options such as salad plates and air fryers, allows guests tocontribute to a home down payment.\n\u201cA future home feels like a thoughtful, lasting investment that friends and family can be part of\u2014no matter the size of their contribution,\u201d says Palasz.\nIt\u2019s not an uncommon request anymore \u2014 48% of newlywed homeowners (buyers married within the past two years) actuallyasked for money toward their down paymentsinstead of typical wedding gifts, according to a recent LendingTree survey. At the same time, a\u00a02023Realtor.com\u00aesurvey\u00a0found that 30% of wedding attendees are open to giving financial gifts toward homebuying expenses in lieu of more traditional presents.\nThough 35% of newlywed homeowners say their\u00a0wedding expenses delayed homeownership\u00a0plans, receiving gift funds as part of a registry is definitely a way for couples to rebuild their coffers.\n\u201cWe definitely don\u2019t expect to receive enough for a full down payment right after the wedding \u2014 but whatever we do receive will absolutely be set aside for that purpose, because I\u2019d honestly feel too guilty using it for anything else,\u201d says Palasz. \u201cThis money will go toward a future home \u2014 it just might take a few years to get there.\u201d\nRooney has definitely put thought into how he wants to manage any gifted monies they receive from their wedding registry.\n\u201cDepending on how quickly we are able to save up, I have a one-to-three year-ish plan, and a three-plus-year plan,\u201d says Rooney, who is basically thinking mostly high-yield savings accounts or bonds. \u201cIt has to be money we could access quickly should an opportunity strike.\u201d\n\u201cFirst and foremost, create a plan in preparation for buying a home to keep you on track,\u201d says\u00a0Rulon Washington, executive director of mortgage sustainability and business education for\u00a0Wells Fargo.\nThis might include getting pre-approved for a mortgage to gain a clear understanding of how much money you\u2019d need to save for a future down payment and closing costs, Washington explains.\nThen consider how you\u2019ll protect that money so you\u2019re not tempted to use it for other expenses.\n\u201cTo help you stay disciplined, you could create a separate account for your gift funds,\u201d advises Washington.\nCouples need to understand that down payment gifts come with rules depending on how much they received.\n\u201cCircumstances vary based on the type of loan you\u2019re applying for, but generally, smaller increments of money are less of a hassle \u2014 the verification process becomes more cumbersome once that gift amount becomes larger,\u201d says Washington.\nIn instances where there\u2019s a large monetary gift, a lender will rely on agift letterfrom the donor (that includes the name and contact info of the \u201cgifter,\u201d amount, date, and a statement of intent) to make sure the large amount being used is truly a gift and not a loan that needs to be repaid.\n\u201cOne of the key documents used in a mortgage review is a consumer\u2019s bank statement, which provides a clear snapshot of your various bank transactions, i.e., your paycheck, monthly spending, and current debt obligations,\u201d says Washington. Unspecified lump sums of money in a borrower\u2019s bank statement can raise a red flag, especially if those funds were recently deposited.\nIf the gift money has been in your account for at least two months before you apply for a mortgage, it\u2019s less likely to be a major concern, though a gift letter might still be required.\nWashington says that gifted funds that remain untouched for a longer period of time (over 60 days) will usually go under less scrutiny by an underwriter (the time frame helps reduce the need for more documentation), but this is all based on each lender\u2019s specific requirements.\nUltimately, Palasz and Rooney say they\u2019d love to start with an apartment purchase in Brooklyn, where they\u2019re currently renting. But for the long term, they both dream of having more space and being closer to nature.\n\u201cWe each grew up near national parks and nature preserves, so having easier access to the outdoors, as well as being closer to our families, feels really important to us\u2014especially if we have children someday,\u201d says Palasz. \u201cEventually we\u2019ll build a home together. But right now, we\u2019re just excited to celebrate this moment with our closest family and friends.\u201d\nBoth say they realize that real estate is expensive and it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get in the game right now, especially in markets like New York. However, starting to save down payment funds feels like a true investment in their collective wealth. But until they can pull together enough, they\u2019ll continue to rent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to have a roof over our head, food to eat, to live in an amazing city, and be throwing a wedding in the mountains with all our friends and family,\u201d says Rooney. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get any down payment funds for our wedding, that\u2019s OK. \u2026 Wherever Eliza is, that\u2019s my home.\u201d",

        "subhead": "Housing Authority worries it won\u2019t be able to cover rent hikes on 18,000 Section 8 recipients.",
        "content": "The Boston Housing Authority last week asked landlords who rent to Section 8 voucher holders, about 18,000 of the city\u2019s poorest households, to avoid raising rents this year as federal funding for housing assistance programs begins to dry up. Section 8 landlords in Boston received letters from the BHA formally requesting they keep their rents level as part of \u201ccost-saving measures\u201d the housing authority is undertaking in anticipation of budget deficits. When Section 8 landlords raise their rents, those costs are passed on to the BHA, not tenants. The letters are just a request. The BHA cannot prevent landlords from raising rents within the federal government\u2019s standards. They are also a warning of pain to come, advocates say, as the Trump Administration reassesses Section 8 and other housing assistance programs. AdvertisementIn the short term, the BHA is expected to be in a budget shortfall this year due to a lack of federal funding for expensive housing assistance programs and is seeking to cut costs. Longer term, the Trump Administration is proposing massive cuts to the program that stand to fundamentally alter Boston\u2019s housing ecosystem and could displace thousands of low-income families. \u201cWe\u2019re sending this letter because we are concerned about the short term deficit we may be looking at in a few months, and because we\u2019re worried about the long term outlook for Section 8,\u201d said BHA administrator Kenzie Bok. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a budget crisis at level funding, what in the world does it look like, and how many people suffer, under massive federal cuts?\u201dAdvertisementSection 8, which provides rental vouchers to lower-income families, seniors and people with disabilities, is the nation\u2019s largest housing assistance program. In Boston, the housing authority distributes 18,000 vouchers, and the waitlist can stretch longer than a decade.Related: 'We need the state to act.' Protesters call for affordable housing funds amid federal cuts.The federal government allocates vouchers to municipalities and other distributing agencies, who in turn distribute them to tenants to rent market-rate apartments. Voucher holders pay no more than 30 percent of their income in monthly rent, with the local housing authority covering the rest of the cost with federal funds.Acceptable rents are set through a formula set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, with limitations on how much landlords can raise the rent in a year based on the local housing market. Those rates are often less than what landlords would make renting to market-rate tenants, and so many seek to raise rents when HUD allows.\u201cYou\u2019re losing money on the units you\u2019re doing Section 8, at least compared to market rate,\u201d said Ed Kelly, a landlord with apartments in Boston and on the South Shore who rents some units in Dorchester to voucher holders. \u201cDoing the program is a lot of work with all of the extra inspections the government requires. You kind of have to raise the rents to make it work.\u201dKelly said he would hold off on raising rents this year on the Section 8 units because the money he makes on the market rate apartments is enough to sustain his business, but said that other Section 8 landlords may not be able to do the same. AdvertisementA planned redevelopment of the Bunker Hill public housing complex in Charlestown is one of many local affordable housing developments funded in part through Section 8 vouchers that the White House wants to cut.\nStantecRising rents are ultimately responsible for BHA\u2019s budget deficit, said Bok. When market rents rise, so do Section 8 rents, but the federal government has in recent years kept funding for the program at roughly the same level. That\u2019s a reason why it is fairly common for the BHA and other housing authorities to end fiscal years in shortfall. Typically, they will try to cut some costs to make up as much of the gap as possible, and at the end of the year, HUD will draw on other untapped funds to fill the rest. Bok is concerned that extra funding will not be available this year, and HUD has directed BHA to come up with ways to cover the anticipated shortfall.But the bigger concern, said Bok, is a scenario in which the Trump Administration\u2019s proposed cuts to the program become reality. In their budget plan filed earlier this month, the Administration called for slashing housing assistance spending by roughly 43 percent, and to replace federal programs like Section 8 with block grants to states to distribute aid themselves.Those cuts would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for tenants and the broader housing ecosystem in Boston, said Michael Kane, a longtime local housing advocate who is also the co-chair of the national Leaders and Organizers for Tenant Empowerment Network, cutting a program that many already consider underfunded. \u201cMillions of people would be displaced,\u201d said Kane. \u201cPeople would be homeless. It would be utter chaos.\u201dUnder the proposed cuts, the BHA would have to cancel vouchers for some 7,900 families, including nearly 11,000 children. Cuts would also make it harder to finance affordable housing projects, which sometimes have their own allotment of Section 8 vouchers that effectively guarantee a portion of the rent will be paid, making it easier to take out loans to finance construction.Related: What's the rent where you live? Check out the Globe's rent tracker.AdvertisementThe BHA has some 4,000 of these \u201cproject-based vouchers,\u201d which support roughly $600 million of debt in real estate portfolios across the city. The federal cuts could impact those projects and buildings, too. Still, the biggest impact would be human, said Kelly, the landlord.While he agrees that Section 8 has its flaws \u2014 Kelly said he has had problematic tenants who have abused the program \u2014 he has seen many more families who lived in his apartments with a voucher use it to steady their lives. One single mother he rented to, he said, recently bought a home for herself and her children. \u201cSome people just need help,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cTo take this program away or to cut it like they\u2019re talking about would be putting people on the street.\u201dProtesters at Boston City Hall on Tuesday.\nDanielle Parhizkaran/Globe StaffAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Mo\u2019 money, mo\u2019 mansions, mo\u2019 problems.\nAs Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs fights in a Manhattan courtroom, his Los Angeles estate is still waiting for a buyer.\nThe Bad Boy Records founder \u2014 who faces federal charges including racketeering, coercion and physical abuse \u2014listed his Holmby Hills mansionfor $61.5 million just a week before his September 2024 arrest.\nThe 10-bedroom, 13-bathroom estate \u2014 which Combs purchased in 2014 for $39 million \u2014 has now languished on the market for more than 200 days, weighed down by the legal and public fallout from his case.\nThe sprawling residence, nestled in one of Los Angeles\u2019 most exclusive neighborhoods, boasts a slate of luxury amenities: a 35-seat movie theater, a disco ball-inspired sculpture, a grotto pool, a traditional pizza oven, a guesthouse with recording studio and a spa facility.\nYet despite its pedigree and lavish features, interest from prospective buyers has been tepid.\nOne local real estate agent, speaking anonymously, noted the chilling effect Combs\u2019 name has had on the listing. \u201cI wish I could help, but no agents want to touch that house or be in any stories related to the case or the listing,\u201d they told theDaily Mail.\nKurt Rappaport, co-founder of the Westside Estate Agency who is representing the listing, declined The Post\u2019s request for comment.\nThe mansion, which once hosted a 2017 Grammy Awards afterparty, has seen none of its former glory translate to offers. Industry insiders say the high asking price is misaligned with the current climate.\nThe price is \u201cridiculous,\u201d one expert told the outlet, citing the serious nature of the allegations against Combs.\nIn March, the listing briefly disappeared, only to reappear less than 12 hours later with the same asking price \u2014 suggesting that Combs is unwilling to entertain discounts.\nNot everyone, however, has been deterred by the controversy.\nReal estate investor Steven \u201cBo\u201d Belmont, known for acquiring high-profile properties with reputational baggage, reportedly offered $30 million for the estate.\nBelmont,who previously purchasedKanye West\u2019s deteriorating Malibu home for $21 million, expressed confidence in turning around the property\u2019s narrative.\n\u201cI want to remove the stigma and focus on the charming elegance of this remarkable property,\u201d Belmont said in a statement at the time.\nStill, few have even toured the home, and none have moved forward with serious offers.\nThe mansion\u2019s faltering market performance coincides with Combs\u2019 ongoing federal trial, which began on May 5 in Brooklyn.\nProsecutors allege that since 2008, the music mogul orchestrated a criminal enterprise using his fame and resources to abuse and control women. The government claims Combs held multi-day drug- and sex-fueled events \u2014 known among his circle as \u201cfreak offs\u201d \u2014 and used footage of these encounters to blackmail victims.\nGraphic testimony and images presented this week further underscore the case\u2019s severity.\nThough Combs\u2019 former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, testified that the Los Angeles property was not the site of these gatherings, public perception appears less forgiving. The association between the scandal and the estate has made the home a tough sell, even in a high-end market.\nMeanwhile, Combs remains in custody as the trial unfolds, pleading not guilty to all charges.\nAdvertisement",

        "hed": "Want to buy her house in Ireland? You\u2019ll need $7 and some luck.",
        "subhead": "Imelda Collins is raffling her house rather than sell it on the conventional market. Anyone in the world can enter.",
        "content": "By Lana Bortolot, New York Times Service\n\n\nIf all goes well this week, Imelda Collins will sell her cottage in the north of Ireland to an unknown buyer. She doesn\u2019t know exactly how much she\u2019ll get for it. But she\u2019s giving everyone a chance to buy it for $6.70.\n\nCollins is selling her home via an online raffle, a method that eschews the traditional real estate market and can hasten a sale without the involvement of bank approvals. The raffle provides a turnkey transaction for the holder of the winning ticket, and could net Collins a higher price than she\u2019d otherwise get. It depends on how many tickets she can sell.\n\nWhen she decided it was time to sell her house, a modest cottage on 1.75 rolling acres outside the coastal seaport town of Sligo, Collins was inspired by a newspaper article she\u2019d read about another Irishwoman who raffled her Dublin apartment with a dream to move to Paris.\n\n\u201cI thought her story was similar to mine,\u201d said Collins, 52, who works for Health Service Executive, Ireland\u2019s public health program. She hopes to use the proceeds to move to Italy, where she lived for 12 years and met her husband, who still resides there.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of research on it. I didn\u2019t just wake up one day and decide to raffle it,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not the first to do this and certainly won\u2019t be the last.\u201d\n\n\nIn January, Collins reached out to the woman in Paris and received a good report on her experience and of the platform she used, raffall.com, a technology company based in England. She studied the company\u2019s Trustpilot ratings, which gave the company a positive score based on user reviews. She also read positive reports from others who used the platform.\n\nShe thought she could make more on the sale via the raffle than in the conventional market, and she liked the idea of transferring the house in a way that the winner could afford for the cost of a lottery ticket. The raffle officially opened in October; ticket sales end May 22 at 10 a.m. Irish Standard Time, with the draw conducted that day. Anyone in the world can enter.\n\n\n\nCollins especially liked the turnkey process \u2014 a system for ticket purchases, payment processing, legal compliance, winner selection and transfer, all handled by Raffall. Since its inception in 2015, Raffall has hosted more than 44,880 competitions, distributing more than 130,000 prizes and $63 million in revenue for contest hosts, according to the company.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic catapulted us up there,\u201d said Stelios Kounou, Raffall\u2019s CEO and founder. \u201cWith everyone locked up at home, bored and with nothing to do,\u201d he said, online \u201ccompetitions,\u201d as they\u2019re called in Britain, became novel. During Ireland\u2019s COVID lockdown, sports teams were among the users, raffling players\u2019 uniform jerseys to raise money.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t anticipate house raffles,\u201d Kounou said. \u201cWe never imagined people would do that.\u201d\n\nTo date, he said, 18 houses have been sold on the platform, \u201cmeaning they hit their sales targets and legally transferred the properties to the winners. Roughly 50 others tried but didn\u2019t reach their targets.\u201d He said gross ticket sales have varied between 400,000 pounds and 960,000 pounds ($530,000 and $1.28 million).\n\nThe raffles overseen by Raffall, which is based in Britain, are legally classified as \u201cprize competitions\u201d and are not regulated by Britain\u2019s Gambling Commission, which defines such competitions as those in which \u201cthe outcome is determined by the participants\u2019 skill, judgment or knowledge.\u201d This distinguishes them from illegal \u201clotteries,\u201d which cannot be run for commercial or private gain.\n\nTo operate its raffles as prize competitions, Raffall requires ticket buyers to correctly answer an entry question to qualify for the draw. The question attached to Collins\u2019 raffle is: \u201cWhich color is associated with Ireland?\u201d The options are red, green, pink and yellow.\n\nRaffles have long been used in Britain to support charitable causes, and several platforms dedicated to online raffles mandate that winners donate a portion of the proceeds to charities. Brands, including the luxury department store Harrods, have used Raffall to raise money for mental health initiatives, and the Beatson Cancer Charity has raised funds to support cancer patients and their families.\n\nKounou said that Raffall has legal and compliance teams to ensure its raffles are legitimate and conform to various entry rules and regulations in the countries of origin. According to the company, contest hosts have \u201cno control or influence over the draws and cannot access the ticket revenue until their winners have confirmed receipt of their prizes.\u201d Only entrants are permitted to see who else has entered and how many tickets have been issued.\n\nThrough her research, Collins decided that 150,000 tickets at 5 British pounds per ticket was the sweet spot, with an added incentive to pay the winner\u2019s stamp duty and legal fees. If she hits the target through the Raffall platform, she must give the house away per the terms and conditions. If she falls short of 150,000 tickets, she will have a couple of options: She can give the winner 50% of the ticket revenue, with 10% going to Raffall, and keep 40% and the house. Or, she can give the house away and keep more of the ticket revenue for herself.\n\nCollins bought her house in 2022 for 133,000 euros ($150,000). After renovation and grounds restoration, she estimates the total property investment at 280,000 euros ($313,000). The valuation of her house, which she estimates to be about 300,000 euros ($336,000), was done a few years ago, but, she notes, \u201cthat figure could have changed in the meantime, due to the housing crisis in Ireland and the shortage of properties.\u201d\n\nShe has yet to calculate all of the out-of-pocket costs incurred to promote her raffle, including hiring a professional marketer and a photographer; using tools from the Raffall platform; and paying for affiliate fees, social media boosts and newspaper ads. Besides the winner\u2019s stamp duties and legal fees, she\u2019ll also pay Ireland\u2019s capital gains tax at 33%, and she has pledged to make a \u201cgenerous donation\u201d to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nOne past raffle winner, Niamh Gleeson, got a converted stone barn in Kilkenny after buying 10 raffle tickets for 5 pounds each.\n\n\u201cI bought the tickets in November 2020 and then forgot about it because I\u2019ve never won anything before except maybe a T-shirt,\u201d said Gleeson, 49, who was living in Dublin and working in finance at the time. When she received an email on Jan. 6, 2021, that she owned the winning ticket, she thought it was spam. \u201cIt took me a while to believe, it was such a bizarre thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cConveyance in Ireland is very slow, and this was only the second house in Ireland to have been raffled, so it took some time to figure out legalities, taxes and transfer,\u201d she said. When she finally visited the house for the first time, in the midst of the pandemic lockdown, it was in a controlled, masked environment. Even then, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anybody about it because I wasn\u2019t sure that it was going to come through.\u201d\n\nBut it did. Gleeson sold her home in Dublin and moved into the stone barn with her two dogs in 2023. \u201cTwo years of lockdown and being confined changed me in that it opened up a lot of possibilities of how I could live and where I could live.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019 offer includes the two-bedroom home, the furniture inside, and the 1.75 acres of garden and meadow. If she sells through to her goal, when all is paid out, she hopes to net about 400,000 euros (about $450,000).\n\nThe anticipation of selling her house is bittersweet, as Collins enjoys her bucolic surroundings and watching birds nest in her yard. \u201cBut I will always find nature and nature will always find me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe raffle winner will be announced as soon as the tickets have been reconciled, Kounou said, adding that a property transfer in Ireland typically takes up to eight weeks.\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "Critics say a new marketing strategy that keeps listings in-house will hurt some home sellers.",
        "content": "ByJim Morrison\n\nWhen a real estate brokerage comes up with a new marketing plan, it usually doesn\u2019t make the news. But Compass Real Estate\u2019s newthree-phase marketing approachhas agents talking nationwide and might even run afoul ofMassachusetts MLS Property Info Network(MLSPIN) rules and the state\u2019sFair Housing Law. Critics are calling it a money grab.\n\nThe first phase of the marketing plan is the most provocative. According to a Compass spokesman, agents are encouraged to suggest to their sellers that their property be listed on an online portal visible only to Compass agents \u2014 who can show the property to their clients \u2014 instead of theMultiple Listing Service(MLS), which can be accessed by all realtors and the public.\n\nAccording to itswebsite, Compass has 1,187 agents in Massachusetts. It had the second-largest sales volume in the state ($7,209,393,457) in 2024, according to theBoston Business Journal.\n\nA Compass spokesman said these private, exclusive listings are meant to give the listing agent time to test the price, gain critical pricing insights from other agents, and generate early demand. The house can be sold during this phase, ensuring the commission remains in-house and doesn\u2019t have to be shared with another brokerage.\n\nIn Greater Boston,the median sales price of a single-family home is around $950,000, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors. Agents\u2019 commissions aren\u2019t public, but the usual charge is 5 percent to sell a home, which they generally split with the agent whose client bought the home. If the agent who lists the property also sells it \u2014 or if another agent from the same brokerage sells it \u2014 then the entire $47,500 commission is shared with the same brokerage. This sometimes happens naturally, but critics say keeping listings private is an effort to hog the whole commission and it\u2019s certainly not in the seller\u2019s best interest.\n\nReal estate attorney Robert L. Bell, ofBell and Izziin Melrose, said coaching sellers to keep their listings private \u2014 even for a short period \u2014 is at least an insult and possibly a violation of an agent\u2019s fiduciary duty to their clients.\n\n\u201cAgents have a responsibility to act in the interest of their customers, and the whole profession is rife with compromises of that principle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [Compass executives] know they can get both sides of more deals if they start doing more private listings. That\u2019s what pocket listings, dark listings, private exclusives and \u2018coming soon\u2019 is all about: Getting both sides of the deal.\u201d\n\nA Compass spokesman responded in an email, \u201cIn 2024, 94 percent of homes pre-marketed as Compass Private Exclusives or Compass Coming Soon ended up on an MLS, showing that price discovery is the key consumer benefit and that most pre-marketed homes are still widely marketed. The end goal of Compass 3-Phased Marketing, if the homeowner chooses, is to go live on the MLS and third-party internet portal sites.\u201d\n\nBut two major real estate portals,ZillowandRedfin, have come out against this practice and said they will not advertise any property that has been privately marketed, even after it\u2019s listed on the MLS. Other online listing services, includingeXp RealtyandNexthome, soon followed.\n\nIn astatement, Zillow said sellers whose homes were privately listed in the last two years lost out on more than $1 billion, and home sellers of color were affected disproportionately.\n\n\u201cThese off-market listings not only harm sellers, but they limit exposure to potential buyers, possibly deepening inequities that have long existed in real estate,\u201d said Orphe Divounguy, Zillow senior economist. \u201cWe must maintain transparency in the housing market so we don\u2019t go back to the dark ages of real estate.\u201d\n\nA Compass spokesman said he questioned the value of Zillow for some home sellers. He said Zillow listings include information that can influence buyers to make lower offers, like listing the number of days on the market, a history of price changes, and factors like walkability scores, climate risk estimates, and Zillow\u2019s estimate of a home\u2019s value, which can be below the list price.\n\nCompass CEO Robert Refkin wrote in a statement, \u201cZillow is abusing its market power and effectively telling homeowners, \u2018we know what\u2019s best for you, and if you disagree, we will ban you and your agent.\u201d\n\nIn the second phase of the Compass plan, the home is showcased to all agents and all consumers on the Compass website, without the risk of exposure from the MLS and portal sites where days on market and price drops are publicly displayed.\n\nThe third phase is when the property is listed on the MLS. Usually, those homes are also fed into portal sites like Zillow and Redfin, but homes previously marketed privately may be excluded from those sites going forward.\n\nMLSPIN, which is the predominant MLS in Massachusetts, requires every agent who takes an off-market listing to submit and signa formthat reads in part, \u201cThe decision not to list the Property with the MLS is solely the decision of the Owner(s)/Seller(s), initiated by the Owner(s)/Seller(s).\u201d\n\nHow they monitor these conversations is unclear. MLSPIN did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nEven ardent critics of Compass\u2019s new initiative concede that listing a property off-market does make sense for a very small percentage of buyers. Celebrities or people with valuable art on their walls might not want nosy strangers traipsing through their homes. Landlords sometimes don\u2019t want their tenants to know when their building is on the market. Stalking or domestic violence survivors may not want a public sale.\n\nWhile some off-market listings are understandable, recommending the practice can raise issues of fair housing. If only a small subset of people are able to see a listing, what groups are being excluded and why?\n\nZillow\u2019s chief industry development officer, Errol Samuelson, said in astatement, \u201dWhen all buyers don\u2019t have the same access to home listings \u2014 and are forced to navigate barriers, possible bias and incomplete inventory \u2014 it undermines consumer trust and weakens the market.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Compass is taking it to a new level. It\u2019s even created aspecial book of off-market listingswhich they call Private Exclusives. The books are updated weekly and made available only to Compass agents.\n\nGibson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty CEOColleen Barrysaid sellers are generally happy when their homes sell quickly, but those who sell off-market can never know how much more money their home would have fetched if it were listed on the open market.\n\n\u201cAs we all know from a free market economy, the best way to get the highest and best offer is to put it out to the greatest number of people,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we just don\u2019t know where that most qualified buyer is going to come from, particularly in a marketplace like ours, which is truly international.\u201d\n\nBarry cited aBright MLS studyof 442,829 comparable home sales in the Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Baltimore markets over two years.

When it was over, I was told that the public had forgotten me and that it would be very hard to get back into films. But luck brought me \u2018Sinbad the Sailor,\u2019 and it hit the jackpot.\u201d\nThe three-bedroom, three-bath residence is rich in architectural detail and historic charm.\nA formal foyer with herringbone floors leads into a library designed with classic sensibilities. Pocket doors open to a flexible adjacent room with its own ensuite bath, a marble fireplace imported from England and built-in storage.\nThe primary bedroom is privately tucked away in its own wing and features two walk-in closets, a windowed bathroom, and ample space for a seating area or a desk, the listing notes.\nThough the building dates to 1927, certain interiors have been thoroughly updated, according to the listing.\nThe time-capsule kitchen, meanwhile, features appliances and storage \u2014 while the apartment overall offers five walk-in closets and a bonus room that could serve as an office, an expanded bathroom or oversized dressing space.\nThe Beekman, originally developed as a hotel, retains many of its hospitality-focused perks. Maintenance fees include daily housekeeping and utilities, and residents have access to a gym, laundry facilities, and a full-time doorman and concierge services. A new restaurant by acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud is set to open in the building\u2019s ground-floor commercial space. Two private storage cages transfer with the apartment.\nLocated in one of the Upper East Side\u2019s most desirable pockets, near Central Park and Madison Avenue shopping, the home offers a rare blend of cinematic provenance and full-service convenience.\nA fixture of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, Fairbanks starred in adventure classics like \u201cThe Prisoner of Zenda,\u201d \u201cGunga Din\u201d and \u201cThe Corsican Brothers.\u201d\nThe son of silent film legend Douglas Fairbanks and stepson of screen icon Mary Pickford, the younger Fairbanks was born into cinematic royalty. His personal life was equally high-profile \u2014 his first marriage was to actress Joan Crawford.\nThe Marcus-Wells Team at Corcoran and Amy Goldberger of Compass hold the listing in a co-exclusive.\nAdvertisement",

The final price to be paid, as well as the new owner, are not yet known.\nSerhant, who\u2019s now the star of \u201cOwning Manhattan\u201d on Netflix, first made his name in real estate reality television on Bravo\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York,\u201d which premiered in 2012.\n\u201cCongrats @bravoandy,\u201d Serhant wrote. \u201cThanks for trusting me and @serhant with your home.\u201d\nSerhant had been eyeing Cohen\u2019s unit for years, according to previous reports.\n\u201cThe first time I ever walked into Andy\u2019s apartment, I said, \u2018Whenever you are willing to part with this, even if I have to pull it from your grip, please let me know. Because it\u2019s a one of one,\u2019\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those treasures that you wait your whole career for.\u201d\nWhen reached for comment by The Post, Serhant could not elaborate on the deal.\nThe apartment reflects a layered, theatrical sensibility befitting its owner.\nIt is currently composed of three bedrooms, with the potential for 4 to 5 bedrooms, and boasts 4.5 bathrooms.\nWith architecture by Gordon Kahn, the custom residence includes a show-stopping walnut, steel and glass staircase; cobalt blue kitchen cabinetry; and panoramic views of both the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings.\nThe unit features a mix of saturated color palettes, from lacquer-red powder rooms to a royal purple rug in the primary suite.\nAmong its many rarities: multiple woodburning fireplaces, a steam room, three storage units, and a primary bath with a teak soaking tub and a marble vanity.\nThe main bedroom also boasts its own fireplace.\nStill, even dream apartments have limits.\nCohen, who had long pined for an open-air escape, decided to move after finding another West Village home that finally checked the box: outdoor space.\n\u201cOutdoor space was the decision! I always have coveted outdoor space,\u201d Cohen, who hails from Missouri, toldPeople. \u201cThere is a dearth of inventory in the West Village with outdoor space, so when I found something that was meaningful enough for me to leave my dream apartment \u2026 that\u2019s what it took.\u201d\nCohen\u2019s new home reportedly cost $18 million and comes with a 2,000-square-foot terrace in addition to 3,000 square feet of interior space. When he\u2019s not there, he\u2019s constantly found walking around the West Village \u2014 and has been a common sight on the streets there for years.\nThe sale marks the end of an era for the Bravo figurehead, whose West Village abode served as a longtime personal and professional refuge.\nOutside of real estate, Cohen continues to juggle a packed schedule. In addition to his SiriusXM channels and hosting duties, he\u2019s currently touring the country with CNN anchor, and longtime friend, Anderson Cooper in their live conversation series, \u201cAC2: An Intimate Evening with Anderson Cooper & Andy Cohen.\u201d\nAs Serhant sees it, parting with the home wasn\u2019t just a sale \u2014 it was a moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those treasures that you wait your whole career for, to find something like this that you get to bring to market and sell,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement",

After years of renovations and restoration, however, the pair have decided to sell it instead.\nThe listing is represented by Eric Moreland and Diane Humphreys of Moreland Properties/Forbes Global Properties.\nThe Georgian-style brick house in the desirable Terrytown neighborhood is located roughly 10 minutes from downtown Austin. The listing is currently among the most expensive in the city.\nThe estate spans 10,000 square feet, encompassing a four-bedroom main house, a two-bedroom guesthouse and a garage. The latter features its own screening room and entertaining space, according to the listing. The property also boasts a pool, a hot tub and gardens.\nThe main house has a sunlit solarium and a paneled library. Listing photos show an empty home with fresh millwork on the walls, leaded-glass windows, creamy marble accents and herringbone floors.\nThe couple spent three years renovating the 1940s-era home, Moreland told the Journal, including opening up the kitchen to the living room and installing extensive millwork in the screening room. The pair also removed, cleaned and reused all the home\u2019s exterior brick, according to the outlet.\nContractors are still putting the final touches on the home, Moreland said.\nStone and McCary launched their production company Fruit Tree in 2020, which has since produced award-winning films like \u201cPoor Things\u201d and \u201cA Real Pain.\u201d\nMoreland told the outlet that the couple\u2019s business interests have \u201cexpanded\u201d since they purchased the 1.24-acre property, and continuing to hold onto it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d for them right now.\nStone\u2019s other recent real estate moves include the $4.42 million sale of her Malibu home in 2022, followed by the $4.3 million sale of her Los Angeles home last year. She made impressive profits in both cases, the Journal reported. Whether Stone and McCary will make a significant buck in parting with their Austin home is unclear, as real estate sales prices are not publicly available in Texas property records.\nThe family still owns a reported $12 million apartment in Lower Manhattan.\nAdvertisement",

Measuring 21,000 square feet, the English Country-style estate is a rarity in Weston due to its acreage. But its hefty price tag isn\u2019t commonplace, either.\n\u201cIt will be a notable sale,\u201d saidMaggie Gold Seeligof MGS Group Real Estate, who is co-listing thepropertywithMark Dohertyof Douglas Elliman. \u201cThe Pallotta home\u2019s sale will be in good company when it happens.\u201d\nDespite its sprawling size, the home still manages to convey the message that a family lives there, said Seelig, who describes it as a \u201cgiant hug.\u201d\nA unique feature of the home is the room dedicated to Jim\u2019s wife, Kim Pallotta\u2019s collection of antique Santa Clauses, which she recently spoke about toThe Wall Street Journal. When asked if she\u2019s been in the jolly holiday space, Seelig said she has.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most magical rooms in terms of just being transported instantly into the joy of what makes the holidays the holidays,\u201d Seelig said.\nAlso equipped with a stunning kitchen with two islands, a pizza oven, and a fireplace, the home has spacious living and dining rooms and two offices. Jim\u2019s music room, which is equipped with prime storage for records and listening equipment, boasts top-of-the-line acoustics.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re into music or have a passion for collecting records or listening to music, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Seelig.\nThe lower level is the ideal spot for hanging out out thanks to the billiards room, theater, gym, bar and gaming area, and wine cellar.\nThe outdoor space creates a flexible sense of indoor/outdoor living.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nThe historic Cape Cod estate of renowned philanthropist, horticulturist, and socialite Rachel \u201cBunny\u201d Mellon is available to rent this summer. It will cost $25,000 per week.\nLocated in a gated community, 19 Indian Trail in Oyster Harbors still has the original gardens that Mellon designed, along with a 1948 structure.\n\u201cThe home has so much history, and that\u2019s what makes it special,\u201d said listing agent Michelle Sylvia.\nAccording to theNew York Timesobituary on Mellon, the Cape Cod estate was one of many she had, including her principal residence in Upperville, Virginia, houses in New York and Washington, apartments in Paris, and summer getaways on Cape Cod, Antigua, and Nantucket.\nHer obituary says Mellon was born into wealth as the eldest child of Gerard Barns Lambert, the president of Gillette Safety Razor Company, whose father founded Lambert Pharmaceuticals and invented Listerine.\nMellon had been fascinated with gardens since childhood, according to her obituary. Although she lacked formal training, she \u201cread her way through the subject\u201d and designed gardens for prominent clients, most notably for her friend Jacqueline Kennedy, who asked her to redesign the White House Rose Garden.\nMellon also designed Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s summer home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum overlooking Boston Harbor.\nShe died in 2014 at the age of 103, leaving the Osterville estate to her grandson.\nAccording to theCape Cod Times, in 2021, one of her grandsons sold another property Mellon owned in Osterville for $19 million.\nThe property listing states that the Indian Trail estate earned renown in the horticultural world and appeared in numerous magazines and books.\nMellon created a series of \u201coutdoor rooms\u201d at the estate, each with its theme and character. The gardens include a rose garden, a vegetable garden, and exotic specimens from around the world in a collection of plants and trees.\nThe Kennedys were frequent visitors to the property (whose Hyannis Port house wasn\u2019t far away). Sylvia says the property\u2019s manager shared stories of how Mrs. Kennedy recovered at the house after her husband was assasinated.\nThe first time Sylvia visited the property, there were items left from Mellon that nobody had ever touched.\nAfter renovating the house to become a rental, Sylvia said there are still personal things throughout the property that Mellon designed herself, including the 1948 structure that boasts the original kitchen (where everything still works, Sylvia assured).\nSylvia said Mellon\u2019s grandson probably built the second structure, mirroring her style in 2005.\nIf the history isn\u2019t enough to lure you into the property, it boasts a large heated pool, water views of Sampsons Island, and a dock on Nantucket Sound.\nThe property has two side-by-side homes with six bedrooms and five full baths. Each house has a full kitchen and outdoor space.\nThere are still weeksavailableto rent during the peak summer months.\n\u201cSome people might like the history,\u201d said Sylvia. \u201cIf history doesn\u2019t interest you, certainly you are in a beautiful setting in a gated community.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

Brokers say their frustration is understandable. Each year, the same Hamptons houses come up for rent again and again. And each year they depreciate \u2014 their furnishings wear, along with their novelty.\nYet demand and asking prices are going up, not down. And while new rentals do hit the market, the inventory of deluxe summer palaces that tick the vast checklists top renters demand remains miniscule.\n\u201cMarch was insane,\u201d says Compass broker Yorgos Tsibiridis, who is currently listing a quirky-cool four-bedroom waterfront home at54 Bay View Drivein Sag Harbor for $360,000 from July through Labor Day. \u201cAnd the money people are spending! It\u2019s the strongest rental season I have seen. I have a couple houses in Amagansett and honestly I could have rented them over and over, like 10 times.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a sour pickle for the Setai set to swallow. They\u2019re happy plunking down $1 million for the season, but they expect quality in return: homes built within the last five years, fresh interiors, a beautiful yard, a large pool with a hot tub, proximity to the ocean or a village and a minimum of six or seven bedrooms.\nGood luck with that this season, says Tsibiridis, with as few as 30 to 50 new homes meeting that criteria on the market from East Hampton to Montauk, and many times that number of interested parties. \u201cThe more expensive houses are the ones that are in most demand right now,\u201d he says. So what gives? \u201cThis year we had a flood of people from LA [due to the January wildfires]. They moved to New York and now they want a house in the Hamptons. I\u2019m also noticing more people this year from Miami and Palm Beach.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s a choosy renter to do? Try something new. Consider something with historic charm, like10 & 12 Fair Lea Roadin Southampton. It\u2019s one of the village\u2019s 19th-century originals, with a conspicuous octagonal turret reminiscent of a lighthouse.\nThis 13-bed classic is asking $1.35 million for Memorial to Labor Day with Erica Grossman of Douglas Elliman.\nOr if you\u2019ve never strayed from the beach, explore the eight-bed estate at10 Morgan Hill Wayin Bridgehampton.\nYes, it\u2019s an impatient six-minute drive to the sand, but what you get in return is 1.4 acres of lawn-pool-and-tennis, surrounded by hectares of protected farmland.\nIt\u2019s asking $950,000 for the season with Compass\u2019 Breitenbach Advisory Team.\nWhichever high-impact home you choose, you won\u2019t have to sacrifice splendor.\nAdvertisement",

(New York City, meanwhile, performed far, far worse. The Big Apple ranked 797 out of the 850 metros surveyed.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, I\u2019m here 52 years, came from the city in Maspeth, moved here. People are great, town is great, food is great. What can I say, I love it,\u201d Rose Polis, of Massapequa Park,told News 12.\nNew Yorkers are willing to shell out for the quintessential suburban Long Island experience offered by the village. The median Massapequa Park home sells for $746,500, according toRealtor.com. That\u2019s more than twice the statewide median sale price in 2024, New York City excluded.\nThe reputation of Massapequa Park took a hit in 2023, however, when one of its 17,000 residents,Rex Heuermann, became the prime suspect in the grisly Gilgo Beach serial killings. Heurmann\u2019s arrestrocked the suburban communityat the time.\nLocal residents are relishing in the good news \u2014 Long Island hardly made an appearance on last year\u2019s rankings, in which Buffalo led the New York pack. The mayor of Massapequa Park, Danny Pearl,shared newsof the recent US News & World Report distinction on Facebook to largely enthusiastic responses.\n\u201cWe knew it all along!\u201d wrote one Facebook user.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud to live here,\u201d commented another. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nOthers were less enthused.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t broadcast this,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t want all the hipsters moving here from the city and getting our property values jacked.\u201d\nThe list\u2019s top-most distinction went toJohns Creek, Georgia.\nThe suburban city 25 miles from downtown Atlanta boasts a high quality of life thanks to a strong job market and high desirability scores. Indeed, the years since COVID have seen a number of residents from across the nation head to Atlanta and its surroundings to start new lives.\nSkylar Topper, an Atlanta real estate agent and Johns Creek native, told US News & World Report that the city is \u201cvery idyllic.\u201d\n\u201cGrowing up here, we kind of called it like a little bit of a bubble because it\u2019s such a good place to live,\u201d Topper said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a pretty desirable area.\u201d\nCarmel, Indiana, which claims the largest number of roundabouts in the country (150 in total) snagged second place.\nNot a single metro in the Northeast breached the list\u2019s top 10 ranking, which was dominated by cities in Indiana, Texas and North Carolina.\nAdvertisement",

A high roller from quant trading giant Jane Street Capital, which recently expanded nearby, sources told theWall Street Journal, which first reported on the area\u2019s luxe transition.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of very wealthy people working in the vicinity, meaning they often want to live in the vicinity,\u201d Compass broker Clayton Orrigo told the outlet. \u201cThey\u2019re buying up the West Side Highway.\u201d\nIndeed, downtown\u2019s transformation from an artsy enclave to a gilded playground is being fueled by a flood of finance and tech firms staking their claim south of 14th Street.\nHeavyweights like Deloitte, StubHub and Jane Street have inked major leases at Hudson Yards and near the World Trade Center, while Google has planted its latest flag in the former St. John\u2019s Terminal in Hudson Square.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the wealthiest corporations on the planet,\u201d said Leonard Steinberg of Compass. \u201cThat changes the profile of the neighborhood.\u201d\nAnd the homes, they\u2019re just as flush.\nDowntown saw more $30 million-plus sales in the past five years than the entire previous decade, according to Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\nSince 2023 alone, buyers have scooped up more than $1 billion worth of homes priced above $20 million.\nA few highlights: a penthouse at 67 Vestry St. in Tribeca went for $41.4 million in February. One High Line in West Chelsea sold a $49 million stunner last year. And a $52 million deal closed in 2023 for another 150 Charles unit tied to ex-Credit Suisse exec Robert Shafir \u2014 who originally paid $29.38 million in 2016.\nThese eye-popping sales are also fueling an avalanche of eight-figure listings.\nAt Aurora Capital\u2019s 140 Jane St. \u2014 a boutique West Village project with a private park, a gym, a pool and even automated parking \u2014 one penthouse is asking a staggering $87.5 million.\nTwelve of the building\u2019s 14 units have already been snapped up since August 2024 \u2014 mostly via Zoom.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a sales gallery, to be honest with you,\u201d Aurora\u2019s Bobby Cayre told\u00a0the Journal.\nThe development at 80 Clarkson, beside Google\u2019s HQ, is another big-ticket entrant.\u00a0Both, as well as 150 Charles, were designed by COOKFOX. Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group, with the Baupost Group, round out the development team for 80 Clarkson.\nThe largest of the new projects with 112 units, 80 Clarkson launched with prices from $6.75 million up to $63 million \u2014 but they\u2019ve already raised prices four times. One newly listed residence clocks in at $75 million. Want your own private wine cellar? That\u2019ll be another $1 million.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a backlog of buyers that haven\u2019t been able to buy ultra luxury apartments downtown,\u201d Serhant broker Peter Zaitzeff, who listed the Padias\u2019 unit, told the Journal.\nZaitzeff, who helped launch sales at Tribeca\u2019s 70 Vestry in 2016, still gets weekly calls begging for a shot at a unit.\n\u201cI have clients in the building who can basically name their price,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting into that building.\u201d\nEven downtown\u2019s historic brownstones are commanding stratospheric numbers \u2014 like a Greenwich Village townhouse that sold for $72.5 million earlier this year. But thanks to tight zoning and limited land, brand-new developments in these parts are smaller and more exclusive than their uptown cousins \u2014 making them even more coveted.\n\u201cIn the past, you just couldn\u2019t get that scale \u2014 whether a townhouse or apartment,\u201d said Steinberg. And today\u2019s deep-pocketed buyers? They want turnkey, not touch-ups.\n\u201cIt really is an arms race in luxury to out-luxe your neighbor.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

It\u2019s now one of the world\u2019s most coveted, exclusive locations \u2014 and a great spot to build a dream house, Brandt told Gimme Shelter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful area, by Mar-a-Lago and the ocean.

It\u2019s like you\u2019re part of a private, secret club.\u201d\nAt\u00a02,930 square feet, the home comes with four bedrooms, four baths and sits on a third of an acre. It also has deeded access to the beach, which is just 245 feet away. It has been owned by the same family since 1981, when it was purchased for $385,000, according to records.\nThe listing is part of a \u201cpost-presidential boom\u201d in real estate, Brandt told Gimme. Since Trump was elected last November, six homes in the presidential security zone have sold \u2014 for $12 million to $27.5 million, according to reports.\nThat includes 1090 S. Ocean Blvd., which asked $45 million as a pre-construction spec house in the presidential security zone. Brandt, who repped the buyer and seller, sold it as land only for $19.5 million.\nThe deal also came with Mar-a-Lago membership that had been grandfathered in.

Boston\u2019s eight-story Coast Guard property was built in 1918 and abuts popular lobster restaurant James Hook & Co. It overlooks the Northern Avenue Bridge, which is set to be demolished. A developer in 2020 proposed a 22-story tower on the Hook site, though construction never began. AdvertisementThe 247 federal workers stationed at the 408 Atlantic Ave. office can relocate to other federal properties in the area, said Dan Mathews, a PBRB board member. The US Coast Guard has another, larger, waterfront location in Boston\u2019s North End. \u201cThen it puts that property into a developable state, where it can be developed with private funds which will generate tax revenue and would be a great economic benefit to the city of Boston,\u201d Mathews said. Since last April, the PBRB said it had twice notified US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, along with Rep. Stephen Lynch, of the possible sale of 408 Atlantic Ave. The board estimates the building would cost $91 million to modernize, and that it has $28 million in deferred maintenance. Advertisement\u201cThe property is potentially suitable for conversion to residential use and the building could accommodate 110 housing units,\u201d the PBRB report said. Related: The Trump administration took down a list of 400-plus federal buildings it might sell. Here\u2019s what was on it.The building sits within 42 acres of waterfront covered by the city\u2019s Downtown Municipal Harbor Plan, that outlined development and zoning guidelines from Long Wharf to the Moakley Bridge. The plan highlighted possible development at the Harbor Garage, where developer Don Chiofaro has long envisioned a tower, along with development at the Hook Lobster site. The Coast Guard building sits along Fort Point Channel near the Northern Ave. Bridge.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIn her time as Acting Mayor, Kim Janey withdrew the plan; the Wu administration has not restarted it, but it is possible that a taller building at the Coast Guard site could be part of future efforts.For its part, the PBRB is a bipartisan group created by Congress in 2019 to identify underutilized federal properties that could be sold or consolidated. Since 2020, ten federal properties that the PBRB suggested shedding have been sold for $193 million; an 11th is is under agreement for $130 million. Selling Boston\u2019s Coast Guard office would mean a cost saving potential of $138 million for the federal government, the PBRB said, and relocating the Coast Guard into other government-owned space would reduce operating expenses by more than $1 million annually. The federal Office of Management and Budget needs to approve the suggested list of properties to sell and leases to consolidate, which isn\u2019t a guarantee. PBRB in late 2021 suggested 15 properties to sell in ten states, but OMB later rejected the recommendation. Mathews, who was appointed to the board last year by former President Biden, said that the board felt \u201coptimistic\u201d about OMB approving the latest round of suggested properties.Related: Federal officials advance plan to brace Boston from sea level riseAdvertisement\u201cThe financial case is really quite strong,\u201d he said. If approved, shedding the 11 properties would cut 7.4 million square feet from the federal government\u2019s real estate portfolio and would save around $5.4 billion in future maintenance or other building management costs over three decades. The properties combined could create $346 million in sales proceeds, an estimate Mathews said was \u201cconservative.\u201d The PBRB worked with real estate advisor Jones Lang LaSalle to determine which properties should be recommended for sale. The General Services Administration, which will be running the sale process, has recently renewed a contract that allows it to hire real estate brokerages to sell the properties. On a press call Thursday, PBRB board members said it was difficult to give exact timing of when the sale process would start. The PBRB studied 58 federally controlled properties in downtown central business districts before releasing its suggestions this month. Beyond the Boston Coast Guard office, the board has identified nine office buildings in Miami, Nashville, Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, and the Washington, D.C. area that could be sold, along with three U.S. Department of Agriculture leases in Albuquerque, New Mexico that could be consolidated. The buildings include a vacant 11-story office that sits on three acres at Washington, D.C.\u2019s L\u2019Enfant Plaza, a 29-story concrete office in downtown Atlanta, and a 1.8 million-square-foot office on nearly 16 acres directly south of the National Mall that\u2019s home to 4,898 Department of Energy workers and needs $379 million in immediate repairs.

So something is changing.\u201d\nWith no personal income tax, no wealth tax and generally no capital gains tax for residents who are not French nationals, Monaco offers financial incentives that few jurisdictions can match.\nExpats must prove they have at least $550,000 in savings, a clean criminal record and a lease or property purchase to establish residency. From there, they can apply for a long-term visa through the French consulate and then seek official Monegasque residency.\nThough Americans must still file US tax returns and report global income, many reduce their liability by claiming the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion \u2014 potentially shielding over $100,000 of foreign earnings from US taxes if they qualify.\nBeyond financial perks, Monaco\u2019s pristine setting \u2014 wedged between France and the Mediterranean Sea \u2014 has long been a draw.\n\u201cWhat everybody knows is that it\u2019s completely safe here, that it\u2019s very beautiful and that the crowds are very, very nice,\u201d Olds said. \u201cWe are sophisticated people with a lot in common.\u201d\nThe country\u2019s manageable size and cosmopolitan population make it surprisingly easy to form connections, she added.\nOlds said Monaco it\u2019s very inclusive, adding \u201cit\u2019s possible to get into the best universities and schools in the world from here.\u201d\nThough Monaco uses the euro and abides by some French laws, it maintains its own government and borders. The result is a distinct cultural identity \u2014 equal parts Riviera chic and financial haven.\n\u201cEverything here is easily accessible,\u201d Olds said. \u201cTop quality of everything, whatever you need. Great clothes, food, everything is here.\u201d\nThe country\u2019s English-speaking environment also lowers the barrier for American transplants.\n\u201cAmericans can speak English,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd do not need to speak any other languages.\u201d\nRealtors say the recent uptick in demand is due in part to growing unease among US property owners, especially in traditional second-home destinations.\nBaby Boomers in markets like Maine \u2014 where nearly 20% of homes were second residences as of 2019 \u2014 have begun shedding vacation properties in response to a turbulent housing market.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Alexander Kraft, who sells high-end homes in the principality and lives there himself, attributes the rising interest from Americans to broader unrest.\n\u201cEspecially in challenging times, Monaco is a safe haven of peace,\u201d he told the Daily Mail. \u201cContrary to other destinations, it is not in some far-flung location but easily accessible in one of the most desirable corners of the world.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIn Monaco, one can safely enjoy the best life has to offer, without the constant political or economical challenges of so many other countries.\u201d\nResidents also enjoy a robust Mediterranean lifestyle \u2014 complete with fine dining, sea access and no shortage of luxury amenities. The country\u2019s iconic Casino Monte Carlo has been featured in James Bond films like \u201cNever Say Never Again\u201d and \u201cGoldenEye.\u201d\nIts coastline is dotted with beach clubs and restaurants near Larvotto Beach, popular for sunbathing, swimming, and water sports.\n\u201cThe food is excellent,\u201d said Olds. \u201cI went to the US for three weeks, and compared to Monaco, the food is inedible.\u201d\nFor those who can afford the buy-in, the appeal of the Riviera enclave lies not just in the tax code or scenery \u2014 but in the promise of a more secure, curated life.\n\u201cMonaco feels like a little village,\u201d Olds said. \u201cThe quality is unbelievable.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "What was once a quiet, rural outpost in Texas is nowone of the fastest-growing townsin the nation\u2014and it\u2019s struggling to keep up with the influx of residents.\nIn just a year,\u00a0Princeton, TX, about 40 miles from Dallas, has seen its population skyrocket, sparking a construction boom and pushing local leaders into overdrive to manage the rapid pace of growth.\n\u201cWhile Texas cities have been leading in population growth, Princeton\u2019s rapid ascent to the top spot was mostly unexpected,\u201d the town\u2019s mayor,\u00a0Eugene Escobar, tells\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae.\nPrinceton\u2019s populationgrew 30.6% from July 2023 to July 2024, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This makes it the fastest-growing town in the nation with a population under 37,000.\nTo put that growth in perspective, in 2020, the town had only 17,000 residents. In 2013, the area had only two traffic lights, Escobar adds.\nFor new residents, Princeton\u2019s location adds to its appeal.\n\u201cFast-growing Princeton offers buyers ample for-sale home options at a lower price tag than the nearby North Dallas suburbs and Dallas itself,\u201d says\u00a0Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.\n\u201cBuyers hoping to be on the north side of the Dallas metro can take advantage of low home prices in Princeton, without sacrificing access to the amenities and job opportunities in the ever-expanding greater Plano area.\u201d\nWith a median home list price of $337,000, Princeton is more affordable than the nearest large metro of Dallas ($437,000), but it also hits a lower price point than the neighboring towns of Allen ($549,700), McKinney ($550,000), Plano ($556,000), and Frisco ($727,000).\nMost homes for sale (96.1%) are single-family. There were 330 homes for sale in Princeton in April, up 72.9% year over year, and up from just 88 homes for sale in April 2019.\nMany of the listings are new construction with builders such as KB Home, DR Horton, and Starlight Homes (a subsidiary of Aston Woods) all creating new developments in recent years.\nEscobar credits the popularity of Princeton to its relative affordability, combined with its proximity to bigger cities with better job opportunities; nearby Lavon Lake, where many come to vacation; high-quality schools; and the area\u2019s \u201csmall-town feel despite its growth.\u201d\nThe mayor says those moving in are mostly well-off, younger professionals. The city has a median household income of approximately $90,809, with a median age of 33.2 years\u2014\u201dindicating a youthful and economically active population.\u201d\n\u201cPrinceton is drawing a wide range of buyers,\u201d Dallas-basedHarrison Polsky, of Douglas Elliman, tells Realtor.com. \u201cFrom young families priced out of Dallas\u2019 urban core to professionals seeking a lower cost of living without sacrificing access to job markets. We\u2019re also seeing buyers coming in from California, Illinois, and parts of the East Coast\u2014markets where affordability and taxes have become pain points.\u201d\nKB Home is one of many builders that have descended upon the once-sleepy town. It opened its 10-plan Princeton Estates there in 2024 and homes are still being built on site.\n\u201cPrinceton is quickly emerging as one of the most desirable areas in Collin County, thanks to its highly rated schools, access to new jobs, and family-friendly atmosphere,\u201d\u00a0Marcia Dillon, president of KB Home\u2019s Dallas Division, tells Realtor.com.\nLocal real estate agentJennifer Vokolek, of Re/Max DFW Associates, notes other reasons for the area\u2019s growth spurt: USDA financing (rural development); access to the new 402-acreEPIC Muslim communityin unincorporated Collin and Hunt counties (which\u00a0Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0opposes); and the large amount of new construction that can offer pricing incentives that older homes can\u2019t compete with.\nIn fact, so many builders\u2014and new residents\u2014fell in love with Princeton that last year the town put a pause on new residential development to give time for infrastructure to catch up.\n\u201cThe city is working on\u00a0updating water and wastewater plans, improving road conditions, increasing public safety, and addressing development standards,\u201d said the mayor\u2019s office of the construction pause (which does not affect commercial building). It also raised a $109 million bond program to benefit the city\u2019s parks.\nDespite the pause on new-home construction, the mayor noted that about 10,000 houses are in the pipeline.\nStill, there are signs things are slowing. The April 2025 medianhome list pricewas down 6.2%\u00a0year over year, and houses are lingering longer on the market: 45 days, a 44% increase over last year.\nFor example, a brand-new four-bedroom, 2.5-bath house (96% of listings are single-family) in thePrinceton Estatesbuilt by KB Home has had its price slashed four times since February, from $387,259 to $357,444. (All four of the active Princeton Estates\u00a0listings\u00a0have seen price cuts.)\nVokolek says the residential building moratorium pushed homebuyers into nearby towns Anna, Celina, and Melissa.\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nPrinceton isn\u2019t the only Texas town to see incredible growth. Other towns in the top 15 include Fulshear (26.9% increase in population); Celina (18.2%); Anna (14.6%); Fate (11.4%); Melissa (10%); and Hutto (9.4%).\nIt\u2019s not only rural areas that saw growth. Big cities such as Houston, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Georgetown, and San Angelo also saw high population increases. In fact, almostallTexas cities with populations of 20,000 or more\u00a0saw population increases from 2023 to 2024.\nOnly nine areas in the Lone Star State lost residents, and the loss was less than 0.3% of their population.\nBut it\u2019s not just cities in Texas experiencing a growth spurt. The Census Bureau lists plenty of other cities that saw significant growth in one year.\nUrban cores that had residents fleeing at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic are now seeing a reversal: New York City again tops the list of major cities adding residents, an increase of 87,184 from 2023 to 2024.\nRounding out the top five gainers were: Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), San Antonio (23,945), and Fort Worth (23,442).\nFlorida and Texas continue their major gains that started with the pandemic.\nSeven cities crossed the 100,000-population threshold, with five of them in those two states: Deltona, FL (population 100,513); Plantation, FL (100,694); Sunrise, FL (100,128); Georgetown, TX (101,344); and San Angelo, TX (100,159).\nTwo others are in the West: Tracy, CA (100,136), and Federal Way, WA (100,252).\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 U.S. homeowners are spending more on home renovation projects, bucking a broader pullback by consumers amid diminished confidence in the economy.\n\nSales at building materials and garden supply retailers rose 0.8% last month from March, the biggest gain since 2022, and were up 3.2% from April last year. At the same time, U.S. retail sales overall rose 0.1%, a sharp slowdown from March.\n\nThe trend comes even as prices for home improvement products have been rising.\n\nThe cost of home repairs and remodeling climbed by nearly 4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Verisk\u2019s Remodel Index. The strategic data analytics firm tracks costs for more than 10,000 home repair items, from appliances to windows.\n\nRecent price increases appear to be driven primarily by labor costs and don\u2019t appear to reflect the ongoing trade war that the Trump administration is engaged in with major U.S. trading partners like Mexico, China and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen panic buying from contractors or investors concerned about the impact tariffs might have on future costs, or labor rates being driven up by stricter enforcement of immigration policies,\u201d Greg Pyne, vice president of pricing for Verisk Property Estimating Solutions, said in a report earlier this month.\n\nHome Depot said Tuesday that it doesn\u2019t expect to raise prices because of tariffs, saying it has spent years diversifying the sources for the goods on its shelves. However, executive Billy Bastek said some products now on Home Depot shelves may disappear.\n\nHe also noted that the chain is seeing fewer customers taking on large home improvement jobs like kitchen and bath remodels, because high interest rates may be dissuading homeowners from borrowing money to finance such projects.\n\nSpending on home renovations has remained resilient as elevated mortgage rates and skyrocketing home prices have frozen out many would-be buyers. That\u2019s kept U.S. home sales in a slump, limiting the market for homeowners who want to sell.\n\nMany homeowners also bought or refinanced their mortgage when the average rate on a 30-year home loan was below 3% or 4% in the first couple of years of the pandemic. That\u2019s made them reluctant to sell now, when the average rate is hovering near 7%.\n\nIn response, many homeowners have opted to to invest in sprucing up their home rather than sell and take on a mortgage with a sharply higher interest rate.\n\nA shortfall in new home construction more than a decade in the making has kept people living in older homes longer. Nearly half of the owner-occupied homes in the U.S. were built before 1980 and have a median age of 41 years, according to an analysis of Census data by the National Association of Home Builders. That aging stock of homes has helped fuel the need for repairs and improvements.\n\nHarvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies\u2019 most recent quarterly outlook of home improvement projects that spending on home renovations will continue to increase this year, despite economic uncertainty.\n\nSpending by homeowners on maintenance and home improvement projects increased 0.5% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $513 billion, according to the JCHS\u2019 leading indicator of remodeling activity, or LIRA.\n\nIt also forecasts annual increases from here that will drive spending to $526 billion by the first quarter of next year. That would represent a 2.5% increase from the first quarter of this year.\n\nRising home prices and signs of a solid economy have supported the outlook for higher spending on home improvement, but that could change if the housing market and economic outlook worsen, said Carlos Mart\u00edn, director of the JCHS\u2019 Remodeling Futures Program.\n\n\u201cBuilding materials retail sales are strong, but we are seeing a significant downturn in the sales of existing homes and their median sales price since the last projection \u2014 both are known contributors to home improvements,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBroader economic turbulence like a recession, a worsening job market or higher inflation would almost certainly temper our expectations.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

Washington St., which will create 45 new rental units, seven of which will be affordable, in a five-story building. About 500 square feet of restaurant or retail use will remain on the ground level.\nBoth projects have zero parking included.\nAt the meeting, board members discussed how the Washington Street building used to be a kitchen supply store. Mark Callahan, the head of development for Copper Mill, mentioned at the hearing that the building used to have a toilet showroom, with some toilets still in the basement.\nHowever, in the 1900s, he said, the building was a candy factory that later became a biscuit company.\n\u201cI think this building has a fairly interesting history, and I hope that when you do the conversion, you find some ways of memorializing that,\u201d board member Ted Landsmark said at the hearing.\nThe approvals were part of a tax incentive program to boost residential development in the city\u2019s core.\nAccording to a recent citypresentation, the city has received 15 applications to create 762 housing units across 20 buildings and convert over 600,000 square feet of office space. Once completed, the projects will bring in over 1,500 new people living downtown.\nBoston\u2019s downtown office vacancy is about 20% and expected to rise to 30%, whereas residential vacancy is about 4%. The city hopes to convert the offices to help revitalize Boston\u2019s downtown following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe conversion program allows developers to have a 29-year, 75% residential abatement. It also gives builders as-of-right zoning in the downtown area and a fast-tracked Article 80 permitting process to save time and money.\nProjects must have 17% residential units at 60% area median income (AMI) and preserve ground-floor retail. The city aims to revitalize 1,000 new housing units and 1 million square feet by 2026. Developers have until December to apply.\nCallahan said at the hearing that the tax incentive was why Copper Mill decided to proceed with this project.\nIt was \u201ca great key to unlock the potential in this building because it\u2019s been empty for a long time,\u201d he said.\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Uli Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nI often think of this time of year as a convergence of anticipation, of well-conceived plans unfolding, and of the seemingly boundless opportunities of a freshly verdant spring garden.\n\nLocal community plant sales, farm stands, and garden centers are bursting with a dizzying bounty of vegetables, herbs, annuals, tender tropical plants alongside hardy perennials, grasses, ferns, vines, shrubs, and trees.\n\nWhat a time to be a gardener!\n\nAt home in the veggie garden, my family has been busy planting for summer and fall harvest. Potato eyes, onion starts, and sweet potato slips went into their designated beds; tarragon, parsley, and thyme tucked into the herbs bed. The asparagus spears have erupted from the earth and rapidly expanded their thin, delicate foliage, while the broad tropical leaves of our rhubarb patch boldly contrast with all other foliage. The blueberry shrubs are in full bloom, and the raspberry patch is full of flower buds or soon-to-be juicy berries.\n\nGardeners are also keen observers of the weather. With cool, wet conditions still in the forecast, we have decided to hold back on planting tomatoes, peppers, basil, eggplant, okra, and melons for another week.\n\nThe annuals and cut flowers we grew from seed are ready to be set in the ground, beginning with sweet alyssum. The blossoms smell like honey and attract beneficial insects, helping us find a sustainable balance with pest pressure. Complementing the sweet alyssum, we chose flowering tobacco to produce an intensely sweet fragrance during summer nights and draw beneficial moths to its long, slender, tubular blooms.\n\nLastly, I bought some red lantana from our local garden center. It blooms reliably all summer to benefit hummingbirds, clearwing hummingbird moths, and many other pollinators. Speaking of the ruby-throated hummingbird, they are here in our region! Aside from blueberry bushes, you can support these high-octane avians by planting coral honeysuckle vine (Lonicera sempervirens), whose trumpet-shaped, red flowers seem to open exactly when the hummingbirds arrive.\n\nI am truly fortunate to be able to feed my family fresh produce, engage my children outdoors to foster respect for nature,ANDprovide resources for as many forms of wildlife as I can. I am also keenly aware that not all gardeners have large spaces to grow plants. One of our readers inquired what apartment dwellers can do to succeed with plants and support pollinators.\n\nQ.I\u2019m a gardener but live in a condo. My only outside space is on my balcony, but I want to help pollinators. What are the best native plants for containers?\n\nJudi DeJager,North Attleborough\n\nA.When I lived in Brooklyn, N.Y., I was routinely impressed by urban gardeners\u2019 creativity and ability to capitalize on the smallest spaces to grow plants. From window sills to rooftops to illegal fire escape containers, few obstacles prevented them from their relationship with plants. Provided balcony gardening is permitted, here are a few ways to enjoy the benefits of growing plants and supporting pollinators.\n\nThere is a trade-off between using a large container or several smaller containers. More soil volume will translate into needing to water less, but the bigger the pot, the harder it is to move around. Large containers expand the choices to include shrubs and small trees that can be paired with other native perennials. Native plant breeders have created some excellent selections well suited for small spaces like Clethra \u201cHummingbird\u201d and Viburnum \u201cWinterthur,\u201d both compact cultivars of pollinator-friendly native shrubs.\n\n\nConversely, smaller pots can be artfully arranged and have more creative possibilities, but they require closer attention to watering. As the season progresses and the roots begin to fill the container, the plants will require more water. For smaller containers, I would suggest looking at selections of native perennials that grow shorter and more compact. Eupatorium \u201cLittle Joe\u201d is a standout Joe Pye weed cultivar reaching 2 to 3 feet in height; Symphyotrichum \u201cAvondale\u201d is a fall-blooming aster similar in height and selected for its stout stems and late-season appeal. For summer blooms, I am a big fan of narrow leaved mountain mint Pycnanthemum tenuifolium, which grows naturally to 2 feet in height and an absolute magnet for all manner of pollinators. All of these lovely native perennials can be combined with annual flowers to create vibrant container displays that delight both humans and pollinators alike.\n\nAs a final word of guidance, be sure to ask the staff where you buy plants if any of the native perennials or annuals were grown using pesticides. There can be no greater tragedy than to unwittingly poison the very organisms you seek to support.\n\nContainer or windowsill planters offer a wonderful way to connect with nature, observe the relationships that these plants sustain, and cultivate a sense of awe and wonder.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Catherine Carlock, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen the Boston Planning and Development Agency board meets Thursday evening, the members are scheduled to certify completion of nearly 1 million square feet of brand new lab space across the city.\n\nSome of it is in thenew Boston home of Eli Lilly & Co., a $700 million research and development facility along Fort Point Channel. That lab started construction without a tenant, but the pharmaceutical giant eventuallyleased the whole thing and moved in last year.\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of Boston\u2019s Seaport District, a new lab and amenities building developed at the former headquarters of Au Bon Pain is opening empty. That project began construction with a tenant signed: Ginkgo Bioworks. Last year, amid broader financial troubles, the companysaid it no longer needed the space and would not move in. And in Boston Landing, sandwiched between the Celtics\u2019 Auerbach Center and the Bruins\u2019 Warrior Ice Arena, stands a 350,000-square-foot, $545 million lab that will open empty but for a first-floor coffeeshop. The BPDA board is scheduled to certify both buildings complete.\n\nThe duality is a hallmark of Greater Boston\u2019s lab market these days. Bright spots surely remain, such as big new lab buildings for AstraZeneca andTakeda under constructionin Kendall Square. But many more life-science buildings are empty, with little demand to fill them \u2014 and little obvious function other than lab space.\n\n\n\nNearly one-third of lab space across the region is available for lease, either directly from a landlord or via sublease from an occupant who no longer needs it. And while the first quarter of this year marked the first time since 2022 with no new labswrapping construction in Greater Boston, there are still some 3 to 4 million square feet worth of space underway, research from Newmark and Colliersshows, enough to grow the market by more than 5 percent.\n\nThat vacancy is going to linger \u2014 and will have many landlords facing loans they can\u2019t pay back, said Jeff Myers, research director at real estate firm Colliers. That couldlead to some sales at rock-bottom prices.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a mounting amount of distress that\u2019s going to force these buildings to change hands,\u201d Myers said. \u201cDistress is probably going to increase and linger in the market. I don\u2019t see an easy way around that.\u201d\n\nColliers research shows there\u2019s some 16.3 million square feet of lab space available in Greater Boston. But there\u2019s just 1.9 million square feet of tenants looking for space.\n\n\u201cWe still do have tenants that are active in the market,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe pipeline is not as robust as it was a few years ago, but it\u2019s not zero. It\u2019s not empty.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Cambridge and Greater Boston remain the world\u2019s preeminent biotech hub, with long-term fundamentals that will remain strong, industry proponents say. But there\u2019s growing worry that the sector\u2019s vitalityfaces unprecedented threatsfrom President Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has moved to make deep cuts to National Institutes of Health funding and other federal investment in biomedical research, and Governor Maura Healey has warned that every dollar cut from research activity results in $2-3 more dollars lost in economic activity. They also threaten to cut off new research at the knees before it can help power the sort of companies that need big labs here.\n\n\nSome life-science tenants looking for space aren\u2019t even looking for labs \u2014 just offices. BXP, the office development giant, formerly known as Boston Properties, recently told analysts it had closed one such deal in Waltham and was negotiating another.\n\n\u201cThese life science companies are looking exclusively for office space as they focus their capital on acquiring de-risked products that are in trials rather than pure drug discovery and therefore, don\u2019t need lab infrastructure,\u201d BXP President Doug Linde said on a recent earnings call.\n\nAn oversupply of life science laboratories and research and development space isn\u2019t just a Boston problem \u2014 a surge of new labs are opening empty across the country this year, according toa recent report from CBRE. And state officials have made clear they know what filling that space means to the Massachusetts economy.\n\nIndeed, just last year the Legislature approved $500 million over 10 years toward the state\u2019s life science initiative. (That funding, however, was just half the initial $1 billion Healey sought.) The first decade-long, $1 billion life-science initiative launched in 2008 under former Governor Deval Patrick, with a five-year, $500 million extension approved in 2018 by former Governor Charlie Baker.\n\n\u201cNothing happened by accident,\u201d said House Speaker Ron Marianoat an event for industry group MassBio last month. \u201cThe cluster of innovation that we enjoy here today is a product of the deliberate policy choice and of a long-term strategy by the Massachusetts Legislature to capitalize on our world-class universities (and) hospitals to create a true innovation economy.\u201d\n\nMariano touted the commonwealth\u2019s117,000 biopharma employeesand Massachusetts\u2019 longstanding reign as the NIH\u2018s top-funded state per capita.\n\n\u201cWe are as of today,\u201d Mariano said at the April 7 event. \u201cWhich is subject to change, I guess.\u201d\n\nBe civil.

It\u2019s the kind of neighborhood where a 10,000-, 20,000-, or even 30,000-square-foot home doesn\u2019t stick out like a tall poppy.\nBut in March, the East Hampton Town Board finally said enough is enough, approving a code change that reduces the size of new houses. The rule limits the size of homes to 7% of lot area plus 1,500 square feet \u2014 but more important (especially if you happened to have just won the lottery) is that the max square footage is now set at a meager 10,000.\nThat\u2019s down from the 20,000 square feet previously allowed.\n\u201cIt perversely advantages people who already built the biggest houses on the smallest lots. Now they have a more valuable property. But it punishes people who held out and protected nature. It seems very unfair to reward people who have these giant, overbuilt houses,\u201d says Douglas Elliman\u2019s Martha Gundersen.\nNeedless to say, the changes have proven controversial in the town (the village of East Hampton has its own codes). But one thing is clear: Homes with so-called \u201cpre-existing, nonconforming attributes\u201d are now the hottest deals in East Hampton.\nGundersen points to the recently built eight-bedroom, eight-full-bath home at39 Timber Trailin Amagansett, which she sold last October for $11 million. It\u2019s just over 10,000 square feet on a 2-acre lot. But it\u2019s already back on the market asking $11.75 million with the Agency\u2019s Dana Trotter.\n\u201cThis is definitely going to be harder to build today,\u201d Trotter says.\nBut Michael Cantwell of Bespoke Real Estate points out the phenomenon is nothing new. \u201cYou see this across the board,\u201d he says, noting that as more and more zoning regulations are added, nonconforming attributes of all types increase a home\u2019s value. \u201cWe sold this property at 7 West End Road in East Hampton. It was a tear-down oceanfront property but it had this little beach shack, a pre-existing, non-conforming attribute that someone could turn into something really cool.\u201d\nThat teardown sold for $24.5 million.\nOne of his brokerage\u2019s current listings is another example of a home that can never be replicated. It\u2019s a five-bedroom, four-full-bath, 5,500-square-foot home at64 West End Roadwith 2.7 acres on Georgica Pond. \u201cIt\u2019s on a peninsula and it\u2019s the type of thing that if you wanted to recreate it today, it wouldn\u2019t be as good in terms of footprint and proximity to the water.\u201d\nIt\u2019s asking $32.5 million.\nBut if only bigger-than-the-rest will do,43 East Dune Lane aka Dune Cottagein East Hampton is the top house on the market.\nIt has 13,176 square feet of oceanfront splendor on a 3.6 acre lot, along with 10 bedrooms and 12 full bathrooms (split between a main and guest residence), a pool, a tennis court and a price tag to match.\nIt\u2019s asking $84.9 million with Terry Cohen of Hedgerow Exclusive Properties.\nGo big or go home.\nAdvertisement",

The deed for the transaction appeared in the city register earlier this week.\nThe apartment includes four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a terrace.\nIt was last sold in 2017 for $6.1 million by real estate broker Jillian Woods and her husband, Jordan Woods. While Woods confirmed to the outlet she was the seller, she declined to comment further.\nSheeran is no stranger to the building.\nIn 2023, he made headlines by signing themost expensive rental contractin Brooklyn that year, paying $36,000 a month for a different unit in the same building. That apartment, Unit S405, was later leased to a professional athlete and recently relisted for $38,000 a month.\nPierhouse, developed by Toll Brothers City Living and Starwood Capital Group, launched sales in 2014 and has become a magnet for celebrity residents.\nRapper Kendrick Lamar purchased a duplex there for $8.6 million in 2023. The 100-unit complex offers luxury amenities including two fitness centers, a garage with EV charging stations and 24-hour attended lobbies.\nThe Sheeran deal comes amid continued strength in Brooklyn Heights\u2019 luxury market.\nWhile the area is typically dominated by high-priced townhouse sales, select condominiums have broken through the leaderboard. Just this month, a unit in the same building asked $7.5 million, while another at 118 Remsen St. recently went into contract with a $7.3 million asking price.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s highest residential sale remains atownhouse at 8 Montague Terrace, which fetched $25 million in 2020.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "Jersey City landlords are going to have to set rent the old fashioned way.\nThe Jersey City Council voted unanimously on Wednesday to ban the use of AI-driven, rent-setting software by landlords.\nThe ordinance, introduced by Councilmember James Solomon, is the first of its kind in the Garden State.\nThe amended ordinance makes a code violation out of use of tools from rental software firms like RealPage or Yardi Systems. Advocates of the ordinance claim these tools help landlords and property management companies to artificially inflate rents and constrain supply.\nSolomon, in a statement provided to The Post, called the move a \u201cbold stand\u201d against rent collusion.\n\u201cWith the passage of this first-in-the-state legislation, we are putting corporate landlords on notice: if you\u2019re using software like RealPage to coordinate rent hikes, you\u2019re breaking the law \u2014 and now, tenants and the city have the tools to hold you accountable,\u201d the statement said.\nEnforcement of code violations includes the ability for residents to sue landlords or submit complaints to the city over the use of algorithmic rent-setting, according to Solomon.\nDetractors of the new ordinance say the measure fails to address the root of the problem \u2014 a lack of new housing supply. Others argue that the language of the bill is overly broad and could lead to unnecessary penalization for property owners,Gothamist reported.\nJersey City has a documented affordability problem. Rent prices in the city have increased by 50% since 2015, according toa 2024 reportby the nonprofit Regional Plan Association. The city was the country\u2019s third most expensive city to rent in April, according toZumper, right after New York City and San Francisco.\nProponents of the new ordinance pin the problem, in part, on landlords\u2019 use of AI-driven tools to raise rents.\nThese tools, according to the bill, aggregate local prices, supply levels, occupancy rates and lease details. The information allows landlords to boost profits by selecting the most financially advantageous rental prices, lease terms or occupancy levels for their buildings.\nA2022 ProPublica investigationfound evidence of faster price increases in cities where RealPage\u2019s YieldStar software was widely adopted by major property management firms.\nThe ordinance comes on the heels of a similar bill proposed in fall 2024, which is currently stalled in the state Legislature, Gothamist reported.\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin filed his own lawsuit in April against 10 of New Jersey\u2019s largest landlords and RealPageover the alleged use of software that forced \u201ctens of thousands\u201d New Jersey residents to overpay for rent.\n\u201cThe defendants in this case unlawfully lined their pockets at the expense of New Jersey renters who struggled to pay the increasingly unlivable price levels imposed by this cartel,\u201d Platkin said in apress release.\nRealPage and Yardi could not be reached for comment by press time.\nAdvertisement",

It\u2019s being marketed by Savills, according to a brokerage release sent Friday.\nAnd for serious film buffs, this isn\u2019t just any country manor \u2014 it\u2019s a shrine to cinematic history.\nThe late Kubrick, born in New York, bought the property in 1965 and spent 14 intensely productive years there.\u00a0He died in 1999.\nThanks to its close proximity to Elstree Studios, the reclusive auteur was able to manage everything from production and editing to pioneering special effects \u2014 all without leaving his leafy 2-acre compound.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to have the privilege of selling many great houses that have a rich and varied history. However, it\u2019s rare for somewhere to have such a direct link to filmmaking unless it\u2019s been used as a location for shoots,\u201d Steven Spencer, head of office at Savills Rickmansworth, said in a statement.\nSpencer added, \u201cThe close proximity to Elstree Studios made it the perfect base for Kubrick and his family, but he also worked a lot from home \u2014 carefully managing all aspects of four films from his extraordinary body of work from within its four walls.\u201d\nNestled behind wrought iron gates and marked with a commemorative blue plaque, the 7,700-square-foot manor exudes stately charm and old-school opulence. Think ornate cornices, soaring ceilings, marble fireplaces, a carved staircase and a drawing room that opens to a sun-drenched conservatory.\nThe main suite comes complete with a bay window, a dressing room, and his-and-hers bathrooms. There are also five more bedrooms on the top floor, plus a studio for any film buffs hoping to follow in Kubrick\u2019s footsteps.\nBut the estate doesn\u2019t end there: a detached lodge with its own four bedrooms and private garden sits on the grounds, along with a two-bedroom apartment perched above a separate garage.\nOutside, manicured gardens give way to a wisteria-covered pergola, a pool, a pool house with a sauna and even a small orchard.\n\u201cQuite apart from its history, Abbots Mead is a handsome period house in its own right,\u201d said Spencer.\n\u201cWell-proportioned rooms provide generous family space with a sense of grandeur, while mature trees at the garden boundaries ensure plenty of privacy and are the perfect backdrop to a beautiful setting.\u201d\nAnd while it may feel like a world away, the property is a quick commute to London thanks to nearby Elstree and Borehamwood Station.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Summer is just around the corner, and as kids count down the days until school is out, families across the the country are getting ready tobook their long-awaited vacations.\nBut for those who don\u2019t find a week or two at a beach quite enough,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00ae\u00a0has crunched the numbers to identify the most budget-friendly towns in the U.S. wherevacation-home buyerswill get the most bang for their buck.\nFor the second consecutive year,\u00a0Pascagoula, MS, emerged as the leader in beach house affordability. The popular Gulf Shore tourist destination is one of six oceanside towns that made last year\u2019s list, which, notably, had only 10 entries.\n\u201cPascagoula has made a concerted effort to revive its downtown district over the last decade. We\u2019re seeing the payoff at work,\u201d says\u00a0Jacqueline Ready, managing broker at Berkshire Hathaway HomeService Panoramic Properties.\nAccording to Ready, the town has much to offer, from a walkable shopping district to a strong local job market, dominated by Chevron and Ingalls Shipbuilding.\n\u201cThere are gorgeous waterfront and water-view homes, both historic and new build. The ancient oaks are just stunning, rivaling Savannah,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a success story.\u201d\nAnd most importantly for prospective homebuyers, the asking prices in Pascagoula are more affordable than in most beach towns in the Southeast.\nThis year\u2019s newcomers to the Realtor.com list include\u00a0Long Beach, WA, in the Pacific Northwest, and the small but iconic East Coast resort destination of\u00a0Ocean City, MD. The expanded roundup of the nation\u2019s most affordable beach towns has entries across seven states, including New Jersey, Florida, and the Carolinas.\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\nTo zero in on the nation\u2019s most budget-friendly resort towns, Realtor.com economists started by analyzing a federal database of beaches and their locations before creating a list of coastal cities and towns.\nThen, those were ranked by median list prices in April for single-family homes, including condominiums but excluding mobile homes.\nOnly cities with at least 50 active listings for the month were considered, to ensure adequate inventory. To guarantee geographic diversity, we included only two beach towns per state in the top 12 rankings, excluding additional entries from states already listed.\nApril 2025 median list price: $165,610\nKnown as Mississippi\u2019s Flagship City, Pascagoula is a Gulf Shore city of 22,000 people that boasts a rich history going back 300 years\u2014and an impressive antebellum architecture to match.\nPascagoula is named for the Native American tribe that lived in the area when Spanish conquistador\u00a0Hernando de Soto\u00a0founded the settlement in the 1540s.\nOver the centuries, Pascagoula has been home to pirates and presidents, as well as the nation\u2019s most beloved beach bum,\u00a0Jimmy Buffett. In fact, the city\u2019s main public beach is named Buffett Beach in honor of the late \u201cMargaritaville\u201d singer who was born in Pascagoula.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing many natives who left for higher education or work return to Pascagoula to plant roots and invest,\u201d says Ready, the area broker.\nPascagoula has no shortage of attractions besides the beach, including the Pascagoula Country Club with a nine-hole golf course. Nature lovers would enjoy the B.B. Jenning Park and the Petit Bois Island, a federally protected wilderness area accessible by boat, while history buffs could spend hours exploring the early 18th-century La Pointe-Krebs House offering a panoramic view of Krebs Lake.\nSwimming in the ocean or playing a round of golf works up an appetite, and Pascagoula\u2019s food scene does not disappoint, offering a wide array of options, from top-rated seafood restaurants to barbecue joints and taquerias.\nApril 2025 median list price: $211,750\nLocated in Broward County, Deerfield Beach offers its 87,000 residents an urban feel tinged with coastal living, with a wide selection of coffee shops, eateries, and green spaces.\nThe small town, which is home to a mix of young professionals with families and retirees, has no shortage of attractions, especially for the adventurous and outdoorsy types. They include an award-winning \u201cBlue Wave\u201d beach, the nation\u2019s longest cable ski courses, hiking trails, and a fishing pier that\u2019s nearly 1,000 feet long.\nCraving some culture? Take a tour of the Historic Butler House, check out the Deerfield Beach Historical Society Museum, or get in on old-timey hijinks at the Florida Renaissance Festival.\nApril 2025 median list price: $242,450\nAlthough best known as the \u201cLas Vegas of the East Coast\u201d thanks to its many casinos and nightclubs, Atlantic City by now has cemented its place among the nation\u2019s most affordable beach towns.\nThe city of just under 40,000 people boasts wide, well-maintained public beaches along the Jersey Shore, as well as one of the region\u2019s most iconic wooden boardwalks lined with amusement park rides, shops, and snack shacks.\nThose looking to indulge in some gambling have plenty of options to choose from in Atlantic City, including the celebrated Borgata Hotel Casino, MGM Tower, and the classic Hard Rock Hotel.\nMost of the city\u2019s high-end resorts also offer relaxing spa treatments and top-notch dining options.\nApril 2025 median list price: $254,925\nLocated in the suburbs of Tampa and St. Petersburg, the tiny town of roughly 3,500 inhabitants is a peaceful spot with a laid-back vibe and a strong sense of community.\nThe town\u2019s big selling point is its affordability, especially compared with other coastal areas in Florida.\nIn more good news for homebuyers, the surrounding Pasco County has lower property taxes and living costs than other parts of the region.\nWith its many beaches, parks, and nature preserves, Port Richey is ideal for those who love to spend time outdoors.\nApril 2025 median list price: $292,000\nSitting near the center point of the 275-mile Texas Gulf Coast, Port Lavaca is a charming getaway that invites visitors to take a breather from the chaotic pace of modern life.\nAlthough the town is small, with just 11,000 year-round inhabitants, it is not short on attractions and activities, from relaxing on Magnolia Beach to taking a stroll in Bayfront Peninsula Park.\nBut\u00a0Port Lavaca is perhaps best known as a top bird-watching destination due to its location on a major migratory flyway for 400 species of birds.\nNot interested in looking for warblers and vireos through binoculars? No worries, because Port Lavaca is also a haven for history enthusiasts, with Calhoun County Museum, La Salle Monument, and Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse found around town.\nApril 2025 median list price: $299,000\nSouth Carolina\u2019s famed resort city, Myrtle Beach is the epicenter of the Grand Strand, a 60-mile string of uninterrupted sandy beaches. For homebuyers, Myrtle Beach\u2019s abundance of condos keeps this popular beach destination relatively affordable, with the median list price below $300,000.\nThe city\u2019s crown jewel is its beachfront boardwalk featuring seafood restaurants, souvenir shacks, the old-fashioned Family Kingdom amusement park, and the 187-foot-tall SkyWheel, one of the tallest Ferris wheels in the U.S.\nBut Myrtle Beach is not all about the beach lifestyle. Celebrated as \u201cthe Golf Capital of the World,\u201d the city and its surrounding areas boast more than 80 golf courses, among them the top-ranked Caledonia Gold and Fish Club and The Dunes Golf and Beach Club, and the\u00a0Jack Nicklaus\u2013designed Long Bay Club.\nOther points of interest in Myrtle Beach include Ripley\u2019s Aquarium and theHollywood Wax Museum.\nApril 2025 median list price: $302,500\nLocated just 2 miles east of Biloxi, Ocean Springs is part of the Pascagoula metro area.\nDespite its small size, Ocean Springs has made a name for itself as a quaint, walkable town that is home to a thriving arts community, independent shops, and restaurants.\nNicknamed the \u201cCity of Discovery,\u201d Ocean Springs is home to many art galleries, studios, and museums, including the Walter Anderson Museum of Art, the Ocean Springs Museum, and the G.I.

But don\u2019t be fooled by the numbers, because it still offers an affordable coastal lifestyle with a relaxed atmosphere.\nIn fact, Corpus Christi\u2019s biggest draw is its beaches, more than 100 miles of them.\nParts of both Padre Island National Seashore and Mustang Island State Park fall within Corpus Christi\u2019s city limits, offering plentiful opportunities to frolic in the surf, camp, fish, kayak, and bird-watch.\u00a0Notably, Padre Island features the longest uninterrupted beach in the U.S., measuring more than 65 miles in length.\nWant a break from nature?

It has five bedrooms and four full bathrooms spread over 4,200 square feet.\nBuilt in 2013, it was designed by architect Jasmit Singh Rangr with wood-cladding that mirrors the landscape and oodles of boxy, cantilevered daring. It comes with an 80-foot heated gunite infinity pool, an outdoor dining as well as a kitchen area and tennis court.\n\u201cThese areas are getting big numbers,\u201d Cantwell says. \u201cEverything rises with the tide.\u201d\nOver on the Long Island Sound, a one-of-a-kind estate is on the market at24 On the Bluffin North Haven, a blob of land that juts out into Noyack Bay (where you catch the ferry to Shelter Island). Built in 2002, it\u2019s a rare architectural masterpiece by William Reese, inspired by modernist design masters such as Tadao Ando and Rudolf Schindler (naturally it was featured in Elle Decor).\nGeometric, clean and composed simply from four materials \u2014 concrete, steel, glass and mahogany \u2014 this three-story home has 5,800 square feet, five beds and five full baths. It also comes tricked out with all the toys: a gym, heated pool, sauna, tennis and a boat mooring. It\u2019s on the market with Saunders\u2019 Laura White for $19.99 million.\n\u201cPeople love North Haven because it\u2019s quieter,\u201d says White. \u201cThey can shop without issues. They can ride their bikes. There is a beautiful bay-front beach and boating. The area is really spectacular.\u201d\nFurther east, at the northernmost point of Northwest Harbor in the hidden waterfront enclave of Landfall is another architectural stunner, known asButterfly House, at 6 Masthead Lane.\nIt\u2019s a midcentury masterpiece modeled on Le Corbusier\u2019s famed roof design (also seen at Marcel Breuer\u2019s Geller house in Lawrence; razed in 2022).\nFull of 1970s flair but recently renovated, the house has 2,400 square feet, two bedrooms, three bathrooms, a pool and access to a private beach on Gardiners Bay.

        "content": "Busy buyers looking to add the Hamptons to their portfolio of plush playpens want one thing: turnkey satisfaction.\nThat\u2019s why brokers say demand for new construction is soaring.\n\u201cIf you are ready to make a decision, are organized and don\u2019t change your mind, you can close in December and it will be ready by June,\u201d says Douglas Elliman\u2019s Martha Gundersen of renovation turnaround times in the Hamptons. \u201cBut if it\u2019s big and if it\u2019s a gut renovation where you take it down to the studs, lift the house and put in a basement \u2014 basically rebuilding a whole house \u2014 that could take a year, to a year-and-a-half.\u201d\nAt 172 Cranberry Hole Road in Amagansett, however, you won\u2019t have to touch a thing. It\u2019s 8,200 square feet and seven bedrooms worth of newly built easy living, with amenities like a 20-by-42-foot heated salt water pool, a hot tub, a tennis court, a \u201csporting field,\u201d a sun deck and 3,000 square feet of travertine patios packed with an outdoor kitchen, dining area, bar, barbecue and fire pit. Gundersen is listing it for $12.5 million.\n\u201cThe demand is coming from families with young children,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to push around baby carriages in the lanes, walk to the beach or a farm stand and live a very healthy low-key life.\nThere are also families from California or Florida with kids and grandkids living in New York who buy a house for get-togethers. They buy new construction because there\u2019s less maintenance \u2014 the air conditioners are new, everything\u2019s new. You don\u2019t have to spend your time waiting for contractors to fix things.\u201d\nBut if you want a fresh facade, buy it now, adds Douglas Elliman broker Thomas Cavallo, who comes from an East End builder family. \u201cInventory is low and the cost of material is increasing,\u201d he says, noting that prices are likely to rise even further due to the current trade wars. \u201cWhere do you think all our lumber comes from? It comes from Canada. So, that\u2019s going to make the cost of new construction go up a bit.\u201d\nWhen future costs go up, builders tend to reprice their existing inventory at what it would cost to build today, leaving no room for relief. However, one get-it-while-it\u2019s-hot opportunity was just completed by BJC Custom Homes at 5 Widow Coopers Path in North Haven.\nIt\u2019s an eight-bed, 10-bath with 9,600 square feet tricked out with all the new tech and toys \u2014 from a sprawling wellness center with steam room and sauna and a home cinema to \u201cresort-style\u201d heated pool and cabana. Cavallo has it listed for $11.99 million.\nOr add ultra-convenience to ultra-ease by shopping in Westhampton Beach.\nThere, the six-bed, eight-bath, 4,900-square-foot \u201cNordic Modern Beach Home\u201d at 774 Dune Road was recently built by First Dunes.\nModern conveniences include: a heated gunite pool, a cabana with shower and bathroom, a chef\u2019s kitchen (Gaggenau and Thermador appliances, check and check) and a four-car garage.\nIt\u2019s asking $8.75 million with Compass\u2019 Christopher Furchert.\n\u201cSerenity now\u201d was never so apropos.\nAdvertisement",

She explains that she was immediately drawn to the area because it offered her privacy, while at the same time being within a short driving distance from grocery stores and parks.\nit\u2019s actually amazing not having neighbors to left and in front of me#lasvegas#lasvegasstrip#edgeoflasvegas#fyp#foryou#foryoupage#desert#casino\n\u201cThe home was a perfect fit for my needs, so the thought of the dark, open desert beside me was not an issue,\u201d she said, adding that she does not feel isolated at all and can still hear the typical noises you would have in any normal neighborhood: cars driving by, kids playing, and dogs barking.\n\u201cI actually really love where I live,\u201d Wojtowich insists. \u201cI\u2019m still perfectly close to everything that I need, while still having that privacy.\u201d\nBut acclimatizing to Vegas\u2019 notoriously scorching climate took some time for the former Midwesterner, who was far more used to blizzards than heat waves.\n\u201cYour body definitely learns to adapt, but that doesn\u2019t mean you still aren\u2019t going to sweat,\u201d Wojtowich admits.\nLiving in Las Vegas, where summer temperatures routinely climb into the triple digits, and especially steps away from North America\u2019s driest desert, Wojtowich says she quickly learned the importance of staying hydrated, cranking up the AC early, keeping the window shades down, and having her car windows tinted.\nWojtowich says her daily lifestyle is most noticeably impacted by the desert environment during the blisteringly hot summer months.\n\u201cLiving an active lifestyle and wanting to be outside, the desert can be brutal,\u201d she admits. \u201cI love to hike and take my dog places, but it definitely is hard to do that when it\u2019s 115+ degrees outside and the pavement is even hotter.\u201d\nSo Wojtowich has adapted, opting to go on hikes and walks during the cooler early morning hours, and investing in a set of doggy shoes to keep her pet\u2019s paws from being seared by the sizzling-hot pavement.\nAnother downside to living in the desert-adjacent neighborhood is the commute to downtown Vegas, roughly 15 miles to the north.\n\u201cWhile I do love where I live most days, there are some days where I could be running late, there\u2019s heavy traffic or construction, and my commute takes double the time,\u201d explains Wojtowich. \u201cMost of my commute to work is just driving to the freeway!\u201d\nBut being a homeowner in an arid landscape off the beaten path has plenty of upsides, according to Wojtowich.\nFor starters, landscaping is a breeze, because there is no grass to water \u2014 but there are still shrubs and trees to liven up the backyard.\nThe biggest perk for Wojtowich is the location itself, which she says strikes the perfect balance between privacy and community.\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\nNever miss a story.\n\u201cI get a mix of both lives!\u201d she gushes. \u201cI have awesome neighbors, my neighborhood is clean, and I love being close to parks so I can attend farmers markets, food events, and even just getting outside.\u201d\nWojtowich notes that the relatively isolated location of her neighborhood does tends to attract some rowdy outsiders, who can be heard some nights riding dirtbikes, setting off fireworks in the desert, and even firing guns uncomfortably close to people\u2019s homes.\n\u201cThere are a lot of animals and kids nearby, so it does get scary sometimes when you\u2019re not expecting it,\u201d she concedes.\nAsked about her interactions with the desert\u2019s wildlife, Wojtowich recounts spine-tingling moments of discovering a variety of \u201ccreepy crawlers,\u201d including scorpions, ants, cockroaches, and stink bugs, in dark closets and under appliances.\n\u201cIt is so very important to have pest control in the edge homes of Las Vegas because the desert is their home, and they are just a foot away,\u201d Wojtowich advises. \u201cWith just a wall in between our home and theirs, they are bound to get inside at some point!\u201d\nIt\u2019s also not uncommon to hear piercing coyote yelps echoing in the open desert in the middle of the night, she says.\nWhat appears to capture the imagination of social media users flocking to these videos is the otherworldly emptiness of the desert\u2014 just a stone\u2019s throw from people\u2019s homes on the edge of Sin City.\n\u201cI think most people would be surprised to learn that while living on the edge might seem unnatural and dystopian, it really is no different than any other neighborhood,\u201d concludes Wojtowich.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "No. 1: Austin, TX",
        "content": "College graduates embarking on careers and setting up homes in new cities might not think of\u00a0Austin, TX, as the most affordable place to live, but that would be a mistake.\nIt has everything a young adult could want, including job opportunities, shorter commutes to work, and plenty of amenities like cafes, restaurants, and nightlife, according to the latest\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0report.\nThe median monthly rent now stands at $1,450, under the national median of $1,699.\n\u201cAustin stands out as the top-ranked city thanks to its strong performance across multiple factors that matter most to recent college graduates\u2014including relatively affordable housing, robust job prospects, a larger peer network, and a lively, culturally rich environment,\u201d says\u00a0Jiayi Xu, an economist at Realtor.com.\n\u201cIn addition to affordable living costs, thriving job markets, and vibrant lifestyles, many of these cities are home to prestigious universities and research centers, such as the University of Texas at Austin, Carnegie Mellon University, and Emory University.\u201d\nThe report analyzed 318 cities and towns with populations of more than 75,000 that are located within the 50 largest metro areas, and took into account these factors important to recent college grads:rental affordability(estimated by rent-to-income ratio for households between 25 and 34 years old); rental availability; share of college graduate-friendly occupations; job stability rates; and job opportunities.\nAustin, TX, came out on top, notably because of its 18.9% rent-to-income ratio\u2014the lowest on the list. All of the markets have a lower ratio than the town/city average of 28.3% and the 24.9% average across the top 50 metro areas. The lower the rate, the better.\nAdditionally, Austin\u2019s local tech-driven companies (among those, the Realtor.com headquarters) promise stable, well-compensated jobs that can pay the rent.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that Austin\u2019s median rent and for-sale prices are not the lowest nationally, Austin remains relatively affordable when compared to other major metropolitan areas, particularly big city/ tech hubs like New York and San Jose, where median rents are more than double those in Austin,\u201d says Xu.\nAnd while reasonably priced rents are important, so is being able to find a rental. The report took into account how easy that was to do in each place.\nThe top markets have an average rental vacancy rate of 8.3%, higher than both the town/city average of 6.6% and the 7.2% average across the top 50 metro areas.\nSince being able to land a well-paying job after college is so vital to being able to afford rent, even a below-market rent, the report also assigned each metro a number based on the Indeed Hiring Index.\nThe index has been normalized to 100 as of February 2020. As a result, the higher the index is, the greater the job market opportunities are when compared to the pre-pandemic baseline.\nThe cities with the highest index numbers on the list were\u00a0Scottsdale, AZ, and\u00a0Richmond, VA. Only one area falls below the baseline:\u00a0Minneapolis, MN, at 96.\nRent-to-income ratio: 18.9%Rental vacancy rate: 29.4%Indeed Hiring Index: 114\nHome to six colleges, Austin locals can afford a median monthly rent of $2,560, according to\u00a0Realtor.com data, with an average annual income of $95,475\u2014that\u2019s 15.6% higher than the average across the top 50 U.S. metros.\nHowever, the average rent in this vibrant Texas city is only $1,470.\nAustin got its \u201cSilicon Hills\u201d nickname because of its many local tech employers such as Dell, IBM, Google, and Apple. It also has a vibrant nightlife scene, with bars, restaurants, and music venues galore.\nRent-to-income ratio: 20%Rental vacancy rate: 9%Indeed Hiring Index: 113\nRaleigh overtakes Bloomington, MN, for the second spot on the list this year. While locals can afford a $2,453 monthly rent, they only need to pay $1,489 on average. Raleigh also has the highest (30.4%) share of college grad-friendly occupations in the top 10 places.\nRent-to-income ratio: 20.6%Rental vacancy rate: 9.2%Indeed Hiring Index: 114\nAt an average of 22 minutes, Overland Park has the shortest commute-to-work time. Longer commutes are not only more expensive, but they also take a toll on work-life balance and mental health. Long, knotty commutes can also signal a city that hasn\u2019t kept pace with its growing populace.\nRent-to-income ratio: 19.7%Rental vacancy rate: 5.2%Indeed Hiring Index: 96\nKnown for being \u201cthe city of lakes\u201d and also having the country\u2019s largest shopping mall, The Mall of America, Minneapolis has one of the lowest rent-to-income ratios on the list. But it also has the lowest Indeed Hiring Index, meaning that while the average person will spend less on rent, they may also have a more difficult time finding a job than in the other cities on the list.\nRent-to-income ratio: 20.8%Rental vacancy rate: 8%Indeed Hiring Index: 114\nWith a rental vacancy rate of 8.0%, it will be easier to find a rental in St. Louis than most of the other places on the list, but with a rent-to-income ratio of 20.8%, you\u2019ll spend a bit more for it.\nRent-to-income ratio: 23.2%Rental vacancy rate: 8.2%Indeed Hiring Index: 126\nTied with Scottsdale, AZ, for the highest hiring index, Richmond offers better chances at finding a job than other places on the list. But with a rent-to-income ratio of 23.2%, it\u2019s a bit more expensive to rent here than in other towns.\nOne of America\u2019s oldest cities, Richmond offers excellent proximity to Washington, D.C., and Delaware\u2019s expansive beaches.\nRent-to-income ratio: 22.3%Rental vacancy rate: 8.7%Indeed Hiring Index: 113\nPittsburgh has long played second fiddle to Philadelphia, but recently it is coming into its own as an affordable place to live, and is being recognized for its beauty and vibrancy rather than its past as a steel town.\nWith an April 2025 median asking rent of $1,459, Pittsburgh offers up reasonable rents and plenty to do.\nRent-to-income ratio: 22.5%Rental vacancy rate: 7.9%Indeed Hiring Index: 126\nWhile Scottsdale might be known for its golfing, retirement communities, and \u201cdry heat,\u201d it\u2019s also a place that is friendly to recent college graduates, with a high hiring index of 126 and a high share (23.0%) of college grad-friendly occupations.\nBonus points: Many apartment complexes come with pools.\nRent-to-income ratio: 22.4%Rental vacancy rate: 8.9%Indeed Hiring Index: 112\nNew to the list, Richardson certainly isn\u2019t as well-known as Austin, but give it a chance. The city blasts onto the list with a high (25.3%) share of college grad-friendly occupations and a very low (3%) forecasted unemployment rate.\n\u201cRichardson not only outperforms in the key metrics mentioned above but also boasts diverse and dynamic economies,\u201d says Xu. \u201cThe city benefits from significant cross-sector synergy\u2014particularly between technology, healthcare, finance, and business services.\u201d\nRent-to-income ratio: 24.1%Rental vacancy rate: 9.3%Indeed Hiring Index: 124\nWhile Atlanta may be a bit more expensive than other areas on the list, it benefits from having the highest rental vacancy rate.\nOne possible explanation for the elevated vacancy rate is\u00a0a surge in new multifamily construction, which has expanded the overall supply of rental units. Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA, is among the markets with some of the\u00a0highest recent multifamily permitting\u00a0relative to the previous five years.\nAnd, of course, the city isn\u2019t known as \u201cHotlanta\u201d for nothing. Its location score\u2014a measure of amenities like shopping, restaurants, cafes, and nightlife\u2014tops the list at 4.9.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "One of the few remaining single-family mansions designed by legendary Gilded Age architect Stanford White has just found a new owner \u2014 at a steep discount from its original list price.\nThe limestone residence at 973 Fifth Ave., overlooking Central Park, has sold for $46 million after years of price cuts and market stops, according to city records filed last week. However, records also show this ranks among the priciest property sales in New York City so far in 2025.\nThe 16,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts mansion \u2014 built in the early 1900s and restored with painstaking attention to detail \u2014 wasmost recently listedfor $49.9 million.\nAt its peak, it sought as much as $80 million when it first came to market in 2021. By the end of 2023, the home re-listed for $65 million before reducing its price in March 2024 to $58 million, before it was taken off market. It resurfaced in February 2025 with that latest price of $49.9 million before quickly going into contract several weeks later.\nThe buyer, operating under the limited liability company \u201cBliss on 5th LLC,\u201d officially closed on the property on May 21. The new owner could not immediately be further identified by press time, but sources told The Post it\u2019s a non-local family working in the finance sector.\nThe seller, an entity tied to former Goldman Sachs partner David Leuschen, purchased the mansion in 2012 for $42 million. In the years since, the owner invested heavily in a full-scale renovation aimed at preserving the home\u2019s architectural integrity while integrating modern luxuries.\n\u201cEverything was fully either restored or put in brand new,\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Andres Perea-Garzon, who co-listed the property with Carrie Chiang and Lesley Schulhof, previously told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s an homage to Stanford White.\u201d\nThe brokerage did not respond to renewed requests for comment on the deal. Adam Modlin, of the Modlin Group, represented the buyer in the deal. He declined The Post\u2019s request for comment.\nThe six-story home is one of just two remaining townhouses in Manhattan that remain true to White\u2019s original single-family design.\nWhite \u2014 whose architectural credits include the Washington Square Arch and the Players Club \u2014was one-thirdof the famed firm McKim, Mead & White. Most of his residential works have long been repurposed into institutional or commercial uses.\n\u201c973 Fifth Avenue is not just an address \u2014 it\u2019s a statement of timeless elegance and ambition,\u201d Chiang previously said in a statement.\n\u201cEvery corner, every detail tells a story of unparalleled luxury, where history and modernity intertwine. It creates an unforgettable experience for those who are fortunate enough to call it home.\u201d\nIndeed, the mansion combines Old World grandeur with 21st-century comforts.\nAmong its period features: nine woodburning fireplaces, elaborately carved woodwork, stained-glass windows and soaring ceilings.\nUpdates include five kitchens, a new elevator, a rooftop terrace with sweeping city views, a steam room finished in Venetian plaster, a silver vault and a climate-controlled wine cellar.\nThough much of the architectural flair has been preserved, some original details have evolved.\n\u201cSome of the interiors may have been Stanford White,\u201d the architect\u2019s great-grandson, architect Samuel White, previously told The Post. \u201cBut I suspect that the owners over the years have changed the interiors around.\u201d\nWhite\u2019s legacy is not without controversy.\nIn 1906, the architectwas fatally shotby millionaire Harry Kendall Thaw in a dramatic, high-profile murder atop the original Madison Square Garden, which White designed. The killing, motivated by Thaw\u2019s jealousy over White\u2019s relationship with the showgirl Evelyn Nesbit, remains one of New York\u2019s most sensational scandals.\nThe sale of 973 Fifth may not have shattered records, but its historical significance and architectural pedigree still made it a coveted gem in a crowded market.\nAs Perea-Garzon put it: \u201cThis is unbelievably rare.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "More From\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Gould",
        "content": "A prominent Russian banker is the buyer of Russian airport billionaireValery Kogan\u2019s palatial spread\u2014 a residence ornately dressed in a Versailles style \u2014 at New York\u2019s famed Plaza, Gimme Shelter can reveal.\nVladimir Stolyarenko who once chaired one of Russia\u2019s largest commercial banks, Evrofinance Mosnarbank, paid $21 million for two units \u2014 1007 and 1009 \u2014 at the famed Central Park-facing edifice. The over-the-top lair \u2014 with trimmings including 24-karat gold and Venetian plaster \u2014first asked\u00a0$50 millionfollowing Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nListing broker Charlie Attias, of Compass, declined to comment.\nStolyarenko\u2019s new dwelling spans 5,302 square feet and features Central Park views.\u00a0Its foyer spills into a great room with high ceilings and paneled walls \u2014 while the main bedroom suite has a bathroom clad in floor-to-ceiling onyx.\nAt the same time, Stolyaranko and his wife, Alfiya, have listed another unit in the Plaza for $10.49 million. What\u2019s more: Their brokers, Jessica and Burt Savitsky, of Brown Harris Stevens, are offering a $7,500 American Express gift card to any broker who brings in a buyer to unit 1503, according to the listing.\nThe Savitskys also declined to comment.\nThat unit, as of press time, has been on and off the market for more than 2,000 days. The couple purchased it for $10.37 million back in 2007. They first listed it for $12.8 million in 2008, according to StreetEasy.\nCome 2019, Vladimir sold a Plaza unit, No. 1903, to Alfiya for $10 million, according to property records.\nThe Stolyarenkos are also the owners of a now-dilapidated Palm Beach property that they bought from fashion titan Tommy Hilfiger and Dee Ocleppo for $35 million in 2018 \u2014 when Christian Angle, of Christian Angle Real Estate, had the listing.\nAt that time, the mansion, at 100 Casa Bendita, looked good but needed a renovation, sources told Gimme.\nLast summer, the Palm Beach Daily News published shocking photos showing the mansion inextreme disrepair,with construction workers finally on the property to fix water and termite damage, rusted storm shutters, rotted doors and more. The paper has alsochronicled neighbors\u2019 frustrationwith the owners of the run-down oceanfront estate, and the flooding on the charming cul-de-sac, allegedly caused by the home\u2019s \u201cbacked-up drainage system.\u201c\n\u201cThere was a bit of a ruckus about it, because they let it deteriorate, and the town forced them to continue with the renovation,\u201d an inside source told Gimme. \u201cIt\u2019s been years and it eventually became an eyesore.\u201d\nThe source added: \u201cIt\u2019s been a mystery. The buyer has been unreachable.\u201d\nAdded another inside source: \u201cIt became horrendous.\u201d\nWhen reached by phone, the Stolyarenkos\u2019 lawyer, Glenn S. Krutoff, declined to comment at press time.\n(Hilfiger and Ocleppo also once owned the Plaza\u2019s penthouse. They bought it for $22.5 million in 2008, and then tried to flip it for $50 million a few months later. It was on and off the market for the next11 years\u2014 including in 2013, when it asked a staggering $80 million. It ultimately sold for $31.24 million in 2019.)\nWhile many ultra-rich Russians fled New York following Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in 2022, some are itching \u2014 and beginning \u2014 to return, several sources told Gimme.\n\u201cThe ones who are returning have lived outside Russia for decades and were often educated in the United States,\u201d a source said.\nThe Plaza itself has its own unique history. Built in 1907, the French Renaissance-inspired chateau-style building was designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh \u2014 the legendary hand behind the Dakota.\nIn 1986, it was listed as a National Historic Landmark. Two years later, in 1988, now-President Donald Trump bought it for $390 million and put his then-wife, the late Ivanna Trump, in charge \u2014 saying he paid her in dresses and $1 a year. He lost the hotel four years later.\nIt\u2019s now owned by the government of Qatar, via Katara Hospitality, which was formerly known as Qatar National Hotels Co.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "There are no regrets in life, they say, just lessons. And homeownership comes with many lessons.\nNo fewer than 45% of current homeowners say they have at least one regret about the purchase of their home, according to a new Bankrate survey. From runaway repair costs to untenable mortgage payments, the burdens of homeownership can lead some unfortunate homebuyers to think twice about the biggest financial decision of their lives.\nMore than two-fifths of regretful owners pointed to maintenance and other hidden costs as a source of their regret, reporting that post-purchase homeownership was more expensive than they expected.\n\u201cFor most folks, buying a home is the most expensive transaction of their lifetime,\u201d said Bankrate senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick. \u201cAfter the purchase is complete, we find that affordability issues rank high on the list of regrets. While homeownership is still associated with the proverbial American dream, it is prudent to consider and plan for many ongoing costs of ownership, not just getting over the threshold of the down payment and settlement.\u201d\nBuying too small of a house was the second most common regret, at 21%.\nA 2024 survey by Talker Research found that space complaints arise relatively quickly among Americans \u2014nearly half reportedfeeling cramped in their home within a year of living there.\nToo-high mortgage payments (16%) and overpaying for the house (15%) followed the top complaints.\nMore than a third of buyers who purchased homes during the red-hot post-pandemic market reported believing they had overpaid, according to a 2022 surveyby Money and Morning Consult, and there\u2019s evidence of whiplash in today\u2019s market. Overvalued home prices and reluctant buyers areslowing the pace of salesacross the country.\nLesser regrets surveyed, according to Bankrate, included buying a house in a bad location, at 14%, and buying too big of a house, at 11%.\nHomeownership regrets varied by generation, the Bankrate survey found. Baby boomer homeowners were more likely to regret high maintenance costs \u2014 a potential consequence of older people owning older homes. Younger generations of homeowners, like millennials, were more likely to regret taking on high mortgage payments and rates.\nDespite the shadow of regret, the survey has a big bright spot \u2014 55% of homeowners reported having zero regrets about purchasing their current home, particularly baby boomers. Nearly 60% of homeowners between the ages of 61 and 79 said they had no second thoughts.\n\u201cWhile some homeowners have a regret about the purchase of some kind, it is telling that the vast majority would do it all over again if they had the chance,\u201d Hamrick said.\nRespondents widely agreed that homeownership remains a part of the American dream, and 70% said they would buy their current home again if they had a do-over.\n\u201cFor those who might yet purchase a replacement home in future years, whether buying larger or downsizing, some of these would-be lessons learned can prove useful,\u201d Hamrick said.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Yoko Ono has a new neighbor at the Dakota.\nAn apartment directly next to the longtime home of the artist and peace activist \u2014 and former residence of the late John Lennon \u2014 has sold for $6.2 million, The Post has learned.\nAccording to StreetEasy records, the four-bedroom, 2.5-bath co-ophit the market in June 2024and sold for its asking price, marking a rare transaction inside the famously tight-knit Upper West Side building at 1 W. 72nd Street.\n\u201cThe apartment is a work of art and received multiple offers,\u201d Daniela Kunen of Douglas Elliman, who held the listing, told The Post.\nThe seventh-floor residence belonged to the late Paul H. Epstein, a prominent copyright attorney whose client list once included cultural luminaries Leonard Bernstein and Rodgers & Hammerstein \u2014 both towering figures in 20th-century American music. The late Bernstein was also a onetime Dakota resident.\nEpstein purchased the unit in 2012 with his husband, Garry Parton, and lived there until his death in 2022 at age 81.\nThe new buyer has not yet been identified.\nThe home\u2019s design mirrors the building\u2019s signature grandeur, with 13-foot ceilings, ornate wainscoting, five fireplaces and a formal gallery that unfolds into eight gracious rooms.\nA library currently staged as a dining room contains a discreet wet bar, and windows frame views of the Dakota\u2019s internal courtyard and the rooftops of the Upper West Side.\nDespite its age \u2014the building was completedin 1884 by architect Henry J. Hardenbergh of the Plaza Hotel fame \u2014 the Dakota remains one of the city\u2019s most exclusive and culturally charged addresses.\nOno first moved into the building in 1966 and remained there after Lennon\u2019s 1980 assassination outside its main entrance. While she now spends most of her time on a 600-acre farm in Franklin, NY, her presence and legacy remain integral to the co-op\u2019s mystique.\nAt one point, she and Lennon occupied as many as five units in the building, using the space for living, storage, guests and Ono\u2019s studio.\nThis sale is just the second at the Dakota this year, following the sale of the late Ilon Specht\u2019s home in February for $8.1 million. Specht was a pioneer for women in advertising, having\u00a0written a successful television commercial for L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Preference hair color in 1973.\u00a0She passed away in May 2024 at the age of 81 from complications of endometrial cancer, according to theNew York Times.\nMeanwhile, only one unit in the building is currently on the market \u2014 a five-bedroom, eight-bathroom residence listed for $17.5 million. It initially listed for $19 million in 2024.\nThough it lacks modern amenities like gyms or lounges, which today\u2019s buyers have demanded for years, the Dakota offers something few others can: a piece of living history.\nThe Dakota \u201cdoesn\u2019t need to appeal to everybody,\u201d architectural historian Scott Cardinal previously told The Post. \u201cAll it needs is 100 people who think it\u2019s awesome. I don\u2019t think it will ever have trouble finding people.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "Explore More",
        "content": "A home is now available on one of New York City\u2019s most exclusive streets \u2014 and it\u2019s straight out of an old English play.\nThe $749,000 two-bedroom unit sits along Pomander Walk, a 104-year-old gated enclave on the Upper West Side.\nThe idyllic co-op community \u2014 with its mock-Tudor style, plus blue, green and red shutters and doors \u2014\u00a0is like nothing else in Manhattan.\n\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re on a TV series from BritBox,\u201d said Compass agent Cole Burden, who is co-listing the property with Nest Seekers\u2019 Natalie Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special experience.\u201d\nListings on Pomander Walk areexceedingly rare. The secret street\u2019s 27 homes, totaling 60 units, reside off of the city\u2019s standard street grid \u2014 akin toSylvan Terrace in Washington Heights.\nThe micro-neighborhood is tucked away between West 94th and 95th streets, just blocks away from Riverside Park and Central Park.\nThe 600-square foot unit currently on offer last sold roughly 30 years ago, according to Burden. The home includes two bedrooms and one bathroom, with a small kitchen and neat built-ins. Burden said he was originally brought in to prepare the apartment for sale through his company SimplifyNYC, which he co-owns alongside his partner Caleb Dicke. Burden described the home as a renovation project.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve priced this in a place where buyers have some opportunity to really come in and make this property their own,\u201d he said.\nBurden and Weiss both have a special connection to the unique community \u2014 Burden told The Post that he first discovered the close-knit community in his 20s, through a close friend that lived there, and Weissgrew up on Pomander Walk.\nThe highly private community was built in 1921 by the architectural firm King and Campbell, and commissioned by Irish developer Thomas Healy.\nPomander Walk\u2019s bucolic, old-world charm was directly inspired by the set of a popular play of the same name. The historical British comedy \u201cPomander Walk\u201d premiered in 1910 and details nine days in the lives of couples living along a row of houses facing the River Thames.\nThe property, which counts among the city\u2019s few remaining mews and mew lookalikes, was landmarked in 1982. It has been reported that stars like Humphrey Bogart, Rosalind Russel and Lilian Gish once owned homes along the otherworldly lane.\nThe home includes a $2,000 monthly maintenance fee, according to the listing, with amenities like a live-in super, porter service, bicycle storage and private storage units available to residents.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "A Brooklyn Heights townhouse that has been a home base for a community of divorc\u00e9es has sold for $1 million above its $10 million asking price, Gimme Shelter has learned \u2014 and it was listed a mere seven days.\nThe seller of 17 Willow Place is Elise Pettus \u2014 a \u201cdivorce whisperer\u201d and founder ofUNtied. Unlike the Knot, which helps women plan their weddings, UNtied helps women navigate the world of divorce \u2014 especially those riding the \u201cgray divorce\u201d wave \u2014after Pettus wishedsomething like it was aroundwhen she was getting divorced.\nThink of her, The Post once wrote, as part of anew set of divorce conciergesfor wealthy New Yorkers outsourcing divorce-related stress and creating new communities for themselves. Some of the workshops and dinner parties she has hosted for her well-heeled community have been held within the charming ivy-covered walls and garden of this townhouse, as chronicled inthe New York Times.\nThe ritzy three-story spread is built on the site of an early 19th-century carriage house. Architect Robert Kahn sculpted the modern manse around the facade and sidewalls of the former structure \u2014 and the result is stunning. And the home certainly proved to be quite popular as a result.\nAs word spread that the house was about to hit the market, that network of women who had \u201can emotional connection\u201d to it helped fuel the buzz.\n\u201cThrough her network, Elise knew a million brokers. Hundreds of them. They [and other divorc\u00e9es] always gathered at the house for UNtied events. It meant a lot to everyone because their lives became better through the process of dealing with their divorces,\u201d a friend said.\nThe townhouse wasn\u2019t even ready to show when the calls started pouring in and potential buyers were offered 20- to 30-minute time slots to see it. The buyer, who wishes to remain anonymous, is an individual who saw the level of interest and put in a high bid, a source said.\nPettus bought her half of 17 Willow Place for $1.88 million in 2014 from her ex, Daniel Algrant, according to property records. Algrant is a filmmaker and writer who co-wrote and directed \u201cNaked in New York,\u201d a film produced by Martin Scorsese. In March, the month she listed the house, Pettus wrote an article for \u201cOprah Daily\u201d about the\u00a0moment she knewher marriage was over.\nAt 4,600 square\u00a0feet, the tony townhouse features four bedrooms and 3.5 baths. It was completed in 2012.\u00a0The minimalist property uses glass window walls and skylights to let in the light. It also comes with a coveted curb cut for a private garage.\nThe dwelling opens to a large, double-height living area with a dramatic three story curved staircase. The living area is also primed for entertaining, and features a woodburning fireplace and a two-story casement window wall that opens to an enchanted, walled-in garden.\nThe main bedroom is on the top floor and boasts a gas fireplace, plus a long hallway filled with closets.\nDesign details also include a rare, rear atrium courtyard.\nIdeal for a family or individual working from home, the residence features three workspaces and a screening room.\nThe listing broker was Joan Goldberg, of Brown Harris Stevens.\nAdvertisement",

Yearly taxes are $90,000.\nElsewhere on the property, Joel\u2019s recently renovated main house remains listed for sale. It comes with a helipad and a dock. It returned to the market last fall for $49.9 million after the completion of a major renovation, but has since seen discounts. Joel never moved back into the main home after the work began.\nThe gatehouse contains two master suites \u2014 both on the water. There is an outdoor kitchen inside a screened-in patio, where there is a built-in gas grill. For security, there is an electric gate, an intercom and a camera.\nAdvertisement",

A rare bridge hovering over city streets that joins them together.\nIndeed, if you ever wanted to traverse a bridge heading home from work \u2014 or host a dinner party suspended between two buildings above Manhattan with nothing below you \u2014 this apartment is the one for you.\nJust a handful of city apartments come with their own bridges \u2014 and now, one that\u2019s part of a $2.75 million Upper East Side penthouse listing is sweetening the local pot.\nThe\u00a0dramatic duplex, at 52 E. 78th St., most notably boasts this landmarked, turn-of-the-century steel-and-concrete bridge \u2014 along with three private balconies and a charming rooftop garden with a white picket fence and a dining area.\nIt\u2019s available for the first time in almost 20 years.\nThe seller, who requested anonymity, told Gimme Shelter it makes for unique and \u201cunforgettable\u201d dinner party conversation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a true townhouse in the sky. I even negotiated with the building to transform the bridge roof into a stunning garden. Living there felt like inhabiting a work of art,\u201d the seller said.\nThe trophy asset includes three bedrooms and 2.5 baths. There\u2019s also a chef\u2019s kitchen.\nThis history of this bridge dates to the now-defunct\u00a0Finch College \u2014 an elite liberal arts college for women. It connected the school to its dormitory.\nNow, it bridges an apartment that now serves as an office-slash-bedroom at 61 E. 77th St. to the duplex penthouse \u2014 and into its living room with 18-foot ceilings and a fireplace. A floating staircase leads to an upper level with two bedrooms, a bath and the roof garden.\nThe modernized bridge now comes with a glass ceiling and an under-lit glass floor, framed by triangular windows with city views; the original rectangular windows are preserved on the opposite side.\nThe seller bought it all for $735,000. It then underwent a two-year, million-dollar renovation led by the structural engineer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and was curated in collaboration with Kushner Studios.\nThe listing brokers are Mike Barit and Justin Rubinstein, of Compass.\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "Billy Joel\u2019s Centre Island, LI estate is back on the market \u2014 this time with a new configuration and a lower price tag for its centerpiece mansion.\nThe waterfront compound, known as MiddleSea, has relisted with a $29.9 million asking price for its 14-acre main residence.\nNews of this price cut followsWednesday\u2019s $7 million saleof the estate\u2019s gatehouse portion to a North Shore couple, and a broader repositioning of the property.\nBut the discount isn\u2019t quite what it seems, said Emmett Laffey, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Laffey International Realty, which is handling the listing.\n\u201cThe new price reflects the splitting of the two buildable waterfront lots, so the gross price remains the same,\u201d he explained.\nThe estate is now offered as three parcels total: the main house at $29.9 million and two neighboring 3-acre lots at $4.95 million apiece \u2014 bringing the full 21-acre offering to just under $39 million.\n\u201cWhen [Joel] bought this 20 years ago, he bought the main house,\u201d Laffey added. \u201cAnd then as he lived there, he bought the adjacent two lots, which are buildable lots, and he purchased a gatehouse. Now we\u2019re selling it like he bought it \u2014 in pieces. The smartest way to sell this incredible land and property is the way he purchased it.\u201d\nLaffey said there have already been several offers on the home, with each prospective buyer \u201ca fan\u201d of Joel\u2019s.\n\u201cYou do have some extreme fans,\u201d Laffey said. \u201cIt is very special. It\u2019s a very famous home to everyone on the North Shore of Long Island.\u201d\nJoel had originally listed the entire compound \u2014 non-divided \u2014 for $49.9 million in May 2023 while it was still under a lengthy renovation.\nAt the time, \u201cit was \u2026 a construction scene,\u201d Laffey said. \u201cAs an unfinished property, you can never sell this magnitude of a home.\u201d\nThe project ultimately stretched more than five years \u2014 far longer than initially anticipated \u2014 and the listing stalled.\n\u201cThe sale,\u201d Laffey added, \u201cwas going nowhere.\u201d\nThe estate\u2019s marquee attraction is this 20,000-square-foot main house that includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, oversized living areas, 30-foot cathedral ceilings and sweeping 180-degree views of Long Island Sound.\nThe residence also features marble and hardwood floors, a spa, a ballroom, a wine cellar and a guest house complete with a bowling alley. Additional amenities include a beach house, a pool, a private dock, a tennis court, a helipad, and a six-car garage within the maintenance house.\nJoel, who purchased the core of the property in 2002 for a reported $22.5 million, never moved back into the main house during the lengthy renovations.\nHe would stay in the just-sold gatehouse at that time, Laffey said, \u201cor the guest house near the main home.\u201d\nDespite parting with the property, Joel \u2014 whose rep declined The Post\u2019s request for comment \u2014 has no plans to leave the area entirely.\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m selling that house doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m leaving Long Island. I still have a house on Long Island,\u201d he said earlier this year. At 76, the musician \u2014 who now is battlinga brain disorder\u2014 added with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna spend a little more time in Florida like old Jewish guys from Long Island do.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "The long-awaited zoning rules would clear the way for skyscrapers to help revive downtown and ease housing crunch.",
        "content": "Downtown Boston could see a lot more skyscrapers if new zoning guidelines for the region\u2019s core business district are approved.The Boston Planning Department on Thursday unveiled what it hopes is the final iteration of a long-awaited downtown zoning plan, which outlines what can be built, and where, in core of the city. The zoning district runs roughly from the MBTA\u2019s Government Center station down along Tremont and Boylston Streets to Arlington Street, out to the MBTA Blue Line Aquarium station, and the Financial District in between. As it\u2019s now proposed, the zoning would cap new development along the Boston Common and Public Garden, as well as near the downtown waterfront, at 100 to 155 feet. The remaining downtown core, which encompasses most of the Financial District, would allow for buildings as high as 700 feet in height, unless they\u2019re barred by other regulations governing shadows or flight paths to Logan International Airport. Allowing skyscrapers to be built as-of-right, and without zoning variances, would let the city of Boston take advantage of its densest areas and clear the path for more mixed-use and housing development, said Boston\u2019s Chief of Planning Kairos Shen. That\u2019s especially important in a time when the office market is still struggling to find its footing post-pandemic.Related: City plan to allow 500-foot skyscrapers in Downtown Crossing hits the brakes after pushbackAdvertisement\u201cThere\u2019s general recognition that the downtown has not fully recovered its full vibrancy,\u201d Shen said. \u201cWe have to have the zoning to allow for people to actually think about more creative ways of investing in their property.\u201d AdvertisementThe zoning plan has been a years-long process to dictate what can be built and where in Boston\u2019s downtown core, and aims to balance the need to alleviate the city\u2019s housing crisis and and downtown\u2019s deep historic fabric, while also promoting the vitality of Boston\u2019s \u2014 indeed, New England\u2019s \u2014 economic hub. A new zoning plan would allow for more tall skyscrapers with minimal permitting in downtown Boston.Suzanne Kreiter/Globe StaffImplementing clear zoning rules will ease the path toward making real estate developments more viable, said Dave Greaney, whose Synergy Investments owns nine properties within the Plan Downtown area. As-of-right zoning cuts down on the risk of a project getting caught in a protracted city permitting and entitlement processes \u2014 which can often take years. \u201cAnything that promotes investment and development in the downtown is great and badly needed,\u201d Synergy CEO Dave Greaney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the impacts of an empty downtown as we came out of COVID, and how retail businesses struggled, how office buildings have struggled. We need development. We need housing. We need to put the housing where the jobs are. ... It makes all the sense in the world.\u201d",

Ellement, The Boston Globe\n\n308 Harvard Road, Stow\n\n$1.725 million\n\nStyleContemporary\n\nYear built1993\n\nSquare feet5,800\n\nBedrooms5\n\nBaths4 full\n\nSewer/WaterPrivate\n\nTaxes$20,204 (2025)\n\nFrom the street, a long and winding driveway leads to this sprawling contemporary sitting on a 2.6-acre treed lot that also has an expansive lawn framed by a classic New England stone fence.\n\nA wide walkway of granite slabs leads to the covered front porch, which at 120 square feet is large enough to host a wooden bench.\n\nThrough the front door, the 150-square-foot foyer has options: To the left is the dining room, on the right is the living room, and in the center is the stairway to the second floor. Moving straight ahead leads to the heart of the home: the kitchen.\n\nThe 196-square-foot dining room has a chair rail, crown molding, baseboard molding, and three double-hung windows on two exterior walls. A central light fixture made of six globes has a black frame the color of a cast iron pan.\n\nThe flooring is red oak, which is spreadthroughoutmost of this home.\n\nThe 675-square-foot kitchen is a great gathering place, compliments ofa J-shaped island and a raised bar with seating for four topped by speckled black granite. The island hosts a cooktop beneath four white pendant lights.\n\nSurrounding the island and the raised bar are two layers of solid wood cherry Shaker-style cabinets with a ceramic tile backsplashand more speckled black granite countertops. Some of the cabinets have clear glass doors. The appliances are stainless steel, including a wine chiller. The sink is underneath a pair of large clear glass windows.\n\n\nSteps away from the kitchen area is a breakfast/dining area occupied by an oval table with seating for four. Beyond the table are three large clear glass doors opening to the 713-square-foot two-level deck. It connects to the bluestone patio that lines the entire rear of the home, 1,614 square feet total.\n\nOn the left of the kitchen and behind French doors is the 352-square-foot family room, the kind of space where the homeowner should hand out sunglasses to visitors. Why? The left exterior wall has a set of three large windows with muntins that nearly run floor to ceiling. They jut out of the exterior wall, creating a window seat. There is a cathedral ceiling and on the second wall, a pair of double-hung windows.\n\n\nIn a straight line from the family room is an 320-square-foot office that also has a cathedral ceiling, followed by an 224-square-foot sunroom. The sunroom is the last room on the left side of the house and features double-hung windows on all three exterior walls and its own entry to the rear deck.\n\n\nThe 240-square-foot living room features a working wood-burning fireplace with a brick mantle and two double-hung windows on an exterior wall.\n\n\nReturning to the foyer and moving directly ahead, the hallway flows into the kitchen. It also provides access to the right side of the house. Off this hallway is the first-floor bathroom with a single oak vanity, a shower stall in the corner, and ceramic tile flooring.\n\nThe bathroom is Jack-and-Jill style, allowing its use from the first-floor bedroom. It\u2019s 360 square feet and has a three-window bump-out with views of the deck, patio, and backyard.\n\n\nJust outside the bedroom is the laundry room, with ceramic tile flooring and space for full-size appliances. This hallway also provides access to the attached three-car garage.\n\nAnd so to the second floor.\n\nThe primary suite occupies a large chunk of this level that also contains three other bedrooms and a full bath. The bedrooms range in size from 196 square feet to 266 square feet. The largest has the added attraction of a private balcony. The 104-square-foot full bath also has itsown balcony along with granite counters, a classic vanity, ceramic tile flooring, and a shower stall.\n\n\nThe primary suite is sized to match the overall home. Between the bedroom, the primary bath, and the very large and very private balcony, the suite totals about 1,317 square feet. This tally does not include the two walk-in closets in the bedroom or the third one in the bathroom.\n\nThe 575-square-foot bedroom features cathedral ceilings, oak flooring, and a reading nook underneath a double-hung window. There is another pair of windows near where the bed is currently situated. A slider connects to the 246-square-foot private deck that winds around the rear of the home and provides a great perch for morning coffee or a nightcap.\n\nNear the furthest end of the deck, a door opens into the 266-square-foot exercise room currently outfitted with gym flooring. And from there, one can access the full, private bath.\n\n\nIt\u2019s 230 square feet and not a classic rectangle, but instead 23 feet long by 10 feet wide. And the widest point is near the door connecting to the exercise room. That\u2019s also where the whirlpool bathtub is located, just a few steps from the water closet and separate shower. The bath has a Shaker-style double vanity made of cherry with Corian countertop underneath a pair of Shaker-style cherry wood mirrors. Flooring is ceramic tile.\n\nThe lower level is finished with a large family room and wide Brazilian cherry-engineered wood for flooring. The final full bath features a single porcelain pedestal sink, ceramic tile flooring, and a shower behind a glass door.\n\nThe home has 200 amp electrical service, a security system, ductless central air conditioning, and oil heat.\n\nRichard Wilcox, broker and owner ofDistinctly New England Properties and Real Estate Servicesin Sudbury, has the listing.\n\nJohn R.

        "content": "Billionaire David MacNeil and his wife Melissa just closed on a lake-to-ocean lot in Manalapan, Florida for $55.5 million in cash\u00a0\u2014 bringing their total spending to a staggering $94 million before the couple even begins to build their dream house there.\nAnd the billionaire calls it a deal.\n\u201cI actually think I got a bargain,\u201d MacNeil, the founder and CEO of WeatherTech, a car mat manufacturer, told Gimme Shelter in an exclusive interview.\nThe land \u2014 which has structures on it, all of which will be knocked down \u2014 is adjacent to another lot that MacNeil purchased for $38.5 million last year.\nThe property runs from the Intracoastal to the Atlantic. When both lots are combined, the end result will be a compound on 3.6 acres \u2014 and 340 feet on the ocean.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the second largest lot in Manalapan, and the only lot in Palm Beach with Intracoastal and ocean frontage is Mar-a-Lago, so this is very special,\u201d MacNeil said.\nThe seller of the $55.5 million lot at 1140 S. Ocean Blvd was celebrity developer Joe Farrell, whose clients over the years have included Madonna and Justin Bieber. The lot was also marketed for\u00a0$95 million, which included a not-yet-built spec house, asGimme reported exclusively.\nListing broker Margit Brandt, of Premier Estate Properties, also represented the seller.\nMacNeil tells Gimme that he is building a residence and a guest house on the massive site \u2014 and that work has already begun with the construction of a sea wall.\n\u201cWe are designing\u00a0an amazingly functional and extraordinarily well-built, aesthetically pleasing home that is classy, not ostentatious,\u201d said MacNeil, who will move in with his wife and three dogs \u2014 with lots of room for their adult kids to visit. The family\u2019s current home base is Fort Lauderdale, where they recently sold a $40 million home.\nThe architect of the Manalapan compound is Holdren\u00a0+ Lietzke, of Monterey, California; the builder is local-based company RWB Construction Management, MacNeil said.\n\u201cWe are building a home, not a house \u2014 with an amazing, timeless design. We are very excited with the preliminary plans,\u201d MacNeil said.\nHe added that the home will also have a large garage for his extensive car collection,\u00a0which starts in the 1920s and runs to this century.\nHaving a property on the Atlantic and the Intracoastal was \u201cextremely important because you get the ocean plus a boat on the Intracoastal. It\u2019s the best of both worlds,\u201d MacNeil said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting permits now, and we are very excited to get going.\u201d\nHe estimates it will take two and a half years to construct.\nManalapan is\u00a0just 10 miles south of Palm Beach and 9 miles north of Delray Beach, and it is becoming the go-to destination for billionaires, as Gimme previously reported.\nBillionaire\u00a0Larry Ellison, co-founder of software giant Oracle, owns the area\u2019s largest private residence, which he bought for$173 million in 2022. He also owns the former beachfront Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa in Manalapan at 100 S. Ocean Blvd., which had asked a stratospheric $300 million.\nAnother local developer Stewart Satter has listed land, and a home he hasn\u2019t built yet, for\u00a0$285 million \u2014a planned ocean-to-Intracoastal estate\u2014 on the site of a teardown mansion that he bought for $27.5 million last year. The 4-acre parcel is\u00a0one of the most expensive residential listings in US history.\nOther Manalapan\u00a0residents include Billy Joel, Tony Robbins and Farrell himself, who has owned a home there for two decades.\n\u201cManalapan is underrated,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cWhere else can you get these kinds of massive, multi-acre, ocean-to-lake spreads, with direct ocean access, right on the sand with no road? It offers close proximity to the action of Palm Beach but with additional opportunities for privacy, security and space.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "content": "After years of red-hot bidding wars, the housing market may be heading into a cold front \u2014 and it may cause prices to fall.\u00a0But there\u2019s a bit of a catch.\nThe number of US home sellers now dramatically exceeds the number of buyers, according toa new Redfin report, signaling a shift in power not seen since the real estate firm began tracking such data in 2013.\nAs of April, there were nearly 500,000 more homes on the market than buyers actively looking \u2014 marking the widest gap between the two groups in that span of time.\nThe imbalance hints at a broader market slowdown, not because homes are becoming more affordable, but because fewer people are willing \u2014 or able \u2014 to buy. And in order to sell, homeowners may have to reduce their prices for the pool of people who are actively on the hunt.\nFor now, despite the cooling demand, prices continue to climb.\nThe median sales price for an existing home rose 1.8% year-over-year in April to $414,000, a record for that month, according to the National Association of Realtors. That marks the 22nd straight month of annual price growth, even as affordability erodes.\nDriving the slowdown are elevated mortgage rates, which are hovering just under 7%.\nHigher borrowing costs are compounding monthly payments, deterring new entrants during what is typically the busiest season for home shopping.\nAt the same time, economic jitters \u2014 ranging from a volatile stock market to global trade concerns \u2014 are making consumers more cautious.\n\u201cBased upon previous spring selling seasons, I have noticed a lot of listings are sitting longer on the marketplace (this year),\u201d Karen Pohl, a real estate agent in Las Vegas, toldCNN.\n\u201cI think there are a lot of sellers who still have really ambitious pricing for their homes, and it may be time to get realistic with their pricing in order to be competitive in the marketplace.\u201d Pohl added that more sellers have begun offering concessions or cutting prices.\nThe surge in listings is the largest since March 2020, while the buyer pool is at its lowest point since the onset of the pandemic, with the exception of April 2020 when lockdowns froze activity.\nRedfin estimates buyer activity based on pending sales and the typical timeline from initial home tour to purchase.\nA recent survey from Bank of America shows that 75% of potential buyers are waiting for both home prices and interest rates to decline before making a move.\nStill, Redfin doesn\u2019t expect the most major price correction.\n\u201cGenerally, the ratio of sellers to buyers seems to be a predictor for home price growth, but with a lag of about three to six months,\u201d Chen Zhao, the company\u2019s head of economics research, told CNN.\n\u201cThe reason we think home prices will fall by 1% and not something larger is because it\u2019s actually very hard for home prices to fall, unless sellers have to sell,\u201d she said. \u201cSellers can always decide they don\u2019t like the prices that are currently in the market and decide to stay in their home.\u201d\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "With rising costs of purchasing and renovating, antique charm is not always a selling point.",
        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of a first-time home buyer.\n\nIn this market, not only are prices high, but so are interest rates, further tightening a budget. After several competitive open houses, you come across a beautiful antique Colonial for sale in Dedham, built in 1801. During your tour, you\u2019re drawn to its historic charm, but take note of the foundation problems and outdated electrical system, both of which will cost a pretty penny to remedy. Is this a house you\u2019re going to put in an offer?\n\nThe answer, increasingly, is no.\n\n\u201cAntiques aren\u2019t for the faint of heart,\u201d saidPamela Bathen, a broker associate with Oak Realty in Ashland. \u201cThey\u2019re not \u2018DIY grab some paint\u2019 type homes.\u201d\n\n\nFirst-time buyers don\u2019t necessarily have the budget to spend updating and maintaining a centuries-old house. Even for those who do, finding time to make those upgrades can be tough.\n\n\u201cAntique homes clearly need to be puttered with, because they\u2019re 200 years old,\u201d Bathen said. \u201cThey can be hard to sell, and I get it. If you\u2019re two software engineers who leave for work at 6:30 in the morning and get home at 5:30 at night, you don\u2019t want to putter with your house.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from theMultiple Listing Service(MLS) for the past six months, homes built before 1880 sold within 25 miles of Boston remained on the market for an average of 58 days. Homes built between 2010 and 2015 stayed on the market for 45. Antique homes also averaged 2,755 square feet while new homes skewed larger at 3,256 square feet.\n\n\nDana Bull, a real estate advisor with Compass in Marblehead, has sold dozens of antique homes on the North Shore. She said that historically, older homes always were the ones that sat on the market the longest. Then there was a shift: Millennials entered the market and started prioritizing living in walkable downtowns, where many antique homes were built. They continued buying antiques through the pandemic, but now the market has changed.\n\n\u201cInventory is up 20 percent,\u201d she said, explaining buyers have more choices. \u201cPeople are going back to really thinking, \u2018Do I actually want an antique?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nIn the real estate industry, an antique is most often defined as a home built before 1880. It\u2019s also a house that is highly romanticized, with wood-burning hearths and rambling front porches clouding the visions of buyers. Instagram accounts like@cheapoldhouses\u2014 which became popular in the mid-2010s \u2014 highlighted beautiful discounted properties across the country, continuing to bolster the idea that living in an old house is a charmed existence.\n\n\nButrecent data from Zillowshows that buyers are willing to pay almost 4 percent more than expected for a home that is already remodeled. In fact, remodeled homes get 26 percent more daily saves and 30 percent more shares on Zillow than similar homes.\n\nAnother key factor at play? A sprawling Illinois home featured on@cheapoldhousesfor $145,000, for example, is a far cry from a comparable one for sale in Massachusetts. New England is full of old and expensive homes. It\u2019s part of the reason open houses for antiques are well attended, but not flush with offers afterward.\n\n\u201cPeople are generally pretty upfront about the fact that, \u2018No, I just wanted to see it,\u2019\u201d Bathen said. \u201cBut we do get great turnout because people recognize that they\u2019re fabulous.\u201d\n\nPotential antique homeowners must weigh the price of renovations when purchasing, as the cost of labor and materials is on the rise. A 2024Houzz reportshows that the median spend on home renovations shot up 60 percent since 2020, from $15,000 to $24,000.\n\nConventional wisdom says homeowners should set aside approximately 1 percent to 4 percent of their home\u2018s value annually to pay for repairs and maintenance. With antique homes, it\u2019s more like 5 percent. For a $700,000 home, that\u2019s $35,000 per year.\n\n\u201cBuyers who are already stretching their budget to afford a home in today\u2019s market may not be willing or able to spend more on renovations or repairs,\u201d saidAmanda Pendleton, Zillow\u2019s home trends expert. \u201cA remodeled home may come with a higher price tag, but a buyer would get to spread that additional cost over the course of a 30-year mortgage versus paying cash upfront to make similar upgrades themselves.\u201d\n\nAside from the cost, an antique homeowner must also vet all kinds of contractors and home professionals, from plumbers to woodworkers. Plus, if a home is located in a designated historic district, there may be renovation specifications to follow.\n\nOld homes, while time, money, and labor-intensive, can be incredibly rewarding to those who purchase them. \u201cOne of my favorite sellers from Boylston said it best: \u2018We don\u2019t own antiques \u2014 we steward them,\u2019\u201d Bathen said. \u201cShe turned an outbuilding into an Airbnb that attracted \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 antique lovers.\u201d\n\nBull recommends carefully considering an antique\u2019s location when buying. An older property in Marblehead, for example, is deemed highly desirable, while an antique in Littleton, where there are many more contemporaries, may not be as desirable or valuable.\n\n\u201cIn order to be an owner of an antique, you have to be comfortable with imperfection. You\u2019re never going to make it perfect, no matter how well you maintain it or fix it up,\u201d Bull said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, and you have to actually like that.\u201d\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "Having conquered its home market, the Japanese toilet-maker Toto is selling more bidets in the United States. Toto\u2019s president says not even tariffs will halt its advance.",
        "content": "By River Akira Davis and Kiuko Notoya, New York Times Service\n\nKITAKYUSHU, Japan \u2014 In 1982, a peculiar commercial aired on televisions across Japan.\n\nAn actress in a pink floral dress and an updo drops paint on her hand and futilely attempts to wipe it off with toilet paper. She looks into the camera and asks: \u201cEveryone, if your hands get dirty, you wash them, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same for your bottom,\u201d she continues. \u201cBottoms deserve to be washed, too.\u201d\n\nThe commercial was advertising the Washlet, a new type of toilet seat with a then-unheard-of function: a small wand that extended from the back of the rim and sprayed water up. After its release, Toto, the Washlet\u2019s maker, was deluged with calls and letters from viewers shocked by the concept. They were also angry that it was broadcast during evening prime time, when many were sitting down for dinner.\n\nFour decades later, Japan has overwhelmingly accepted Toto\u2019s innovation. Washlet-style bidets, sold by Toto and a few smaller rivals, are a common feature in Japan\u2019s offices and public restrooms and account for more than 80% of all household toilets, according to government surveys.\n\nToto now sees a similar shift emerging in the United States.\n\nAfter decades of trying to persuade leery American consumers of the merits of bidets, Toto Washlets have become something of a social phenomenon \u2014 popping up on social media tours of five-star hotels and celebrity homes. Comedian Ali Wong devoted a segment of her 2024 Netflix special to Toto\u2019s \u201cmagical Japanese toilet.\u201d In 2022, rapper Drake gifted four Totos to artist DJ Khaled.\n\nAn industry report last year showed that more than 2 in 5 renovating homeowners in the United States are choosing to install toilets with specialty features, including bidet toilet seats. Toto\u2019s profits in its Americas housing equipment business have grown more than eightfold over the past five years \u2014 and the company has its sights on expanding even more.\n\n\n\n\u201cI could have never imagined how popular Washlets would become overseas,\u201d said Shinya Tamura, a former Washlet engineer who was recently appointed Toto\u2019s president. But as was the case with Washlets in Japan, \u201conce the fire is lit, they tend to hit a J curve,\u201d he said.\n\nToto was founded in 1917 in Kitakyushu, an industrial port city at the tip of Japan\u2019s southernmost main island. Like many Japanese companies, Toto excelled at adopting and refining overseas technologies, such as Western-style seated flush toilets, for the Japanese market.\n\nIn the 1960s, Toto noticed a little-known bidet-like device being used in the medical industry in the United States. It began redeveloping the device in Japan, enlisting more than 300 employees to test and optimize aspects like the water stream\u2019s flow, angle and temperature.\n\nThe Toto Washlet first appeared in 1980. At the time, the product had three primary functions: washing, drying and a heated seat. It was expensive, costing the equivalent of about $2,000 in today\u2019s currency, and early models were known to sometimes spray inspectors in the face.\n\nThe Japanese public was slow to warm to the devices. It took Toto 18 years to sell its first 10 million Washlets. But Toto added features \u2014 deodorizing in 1992 and automatic flushing and lid opening in 2003 \u2014 and sales picked up.\n\nIn current models, the water spray is kept at a precise 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature the company describes as \u201cwarm but not surprising.\u201d Toto sold another 10 million Washlets between 2019 and mid-2022 and has maintained a similar pace of sales since. Its all-time Washlet sales now exceed 60 million.\n\n\n\nThe rise of Toto Washlets makes sense in the cultural context of Japan, said Masako Shirakura, an industry analyst.\n\nIn contrast to Western countries, where toilets are sometimes mocked and generally accepted as being dirty, toilets tend to be more respected in Japan, Shirakura said. This traces back to a belief in Japan that gods or spirits reside in all things, even household objects like toilets, she said.\n\nJapan has also built a brand of capitalism, Shirakura said, that seeks to transform even minor inconveniences of modern life into business opportunities. This is evident in heated toilet seats, self-filling bathtubs and notebooks with ringed spines that flatten to avoid poking one\u2019s hands while writing.\n\n\u201cJapan has a very strong culture of endlessly challenging these types of things, and that\u2019s why it has been able to evolve and perfect things like Washlets,\u201d Shirakura said.\n\nToto-style bidet toilets first spread to Japan\u2019s neighbors, including South Korea and Taiwan. After they expanded to China in 1994, the country quickly became Toto\u2019s top overseas market, but sales outside Asia remained elusive.\n\nWhen Toto began selling Washlets in the United States in 1989, it encountered many of the same hurdles it faced early on in Japan.\n\n\n\nThe company was shut out of magazines and upscale malls that were reluctant to run advertisements for toilets, Tamura said. He recalls a 2007 backlash in New York from a Washlet billboard in Times Square displaying a row of naked backsides.\n\nBy the late 2010s, Toto had built an American sales network for its Washlets, using local business partnerships, listings on Amazon and Costco store shelves. However, it was having to rely mostly on word-of-mouth marketing, and demand lagged. Toto\u2019s annual sales in its Americas housing equipment business were stuck under $300 million \u2014 less than half of its Chinese proceeds at the time.\n\nThe company saw a big shift when the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020.\n\nDuring nationwide lockdowns, Americans struggling to get toilet paper began flocking to Washlets. In 2020, Toto Washlet sales in North America nearly doubled from the year prior. That boom has carried forward, even after toilet paper stocks have replenished, Tamura said.\n\nToto has also benefited from record numbers of tourists descending on Japan and becoming converts. Ryan Gregory, a biology professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, experienced Washlets for the first time during a recent trip to Japan.\n\nInitially, he was apprehensive. \u201cIt\u2019s not a region of your anatomy that you\u2019re used to having sprayed for most of us,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cI think fairly quickly you realize that North American toilets are vastly inferior.\u201d\n\n\nAfter leaving Japan, Gregory bought two Toto Washlets for his home. The Washlets have become a hit with visiting friends and family, he said: \u201cNow it\u2019s very much the case that anywhere we go it\u2019s like, \u2018Ugh it\u2019s not even heated, what are we doing here?\u2019\u201d\n\nMore recently, Toto, like many international businesses, has had to navigate the whiplash of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies.\n\nToto manufactures most of the Washlets it sells in the United States in Thailand and Malaysia, countries that Trump has threatened with additional tariffs of more than 20%. Trump\u2019s tariffs, if enacted, would most likely force Toto to raise its prices in the United States, Tamura said.\n\nEven so, he said, Toto sees plenty of room for growth, since Washlet-style bidets still account for only about 2.5% of American toilets.\n\n\u201cEven with tariffs, the United States will be the biggest growth market for us,\u201d Tamura said, adding that Toto is not changing its target of more than doubling its Washlet sales in the United States by the end of 2027.\n\nHe shared another personal goal: \u201cAs revenge, I kind of want to try Times Square again.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

Nashville saw an influx of activity as it offers plenty of charm, without losing the amenities of larger cities.\u201d\nA zoomed-out look at Nashville\u2019s housing market shows that in April, the median listing price in the city was just shy of $550,000, representing a 4% decrease from the previous year.\nDuring the same month, New York City and Los Angeles saw their median listing prices climb to $789,000 and $1,195,000, respectively.\nFiore, the Nashville Re/Max agent, says that many of his clients coming from Los Angeles are looking to spend well over $1 million in Nashville.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find any homes in L.A. under $1 million, so the majority of clients selling there and moving to Tennessee are spending over $1 million,\u201d says Fiore. \u201cBeing able to come to Tennessee, with no state income tax, and seeing how far their money goes out here compared to L.A., is a no-brainer.\u201d\nFellow Re/Max agent\u00a0Angela Terrance\u00a0notes that it\u2019s not just Big Apple dwellers and Angelenos looking to call Nashville \u201chome.\u201d Her clients include transplants from across California, from\u00a0San Diego\u00a0to\u00a0San Francisco, as well as from Chicago, Kansas, and Washington state.\nAnd while Terrance agrees that the majority of newcomers are drawn to Tennessee for lower taxes and higher affordability, there\u2019s another reason why many people are looking to relocate to the Southern metro.\n\u201cMany are coming here for political reasons,\u201d notes Terrance. \u201cThey are upset with the politics of their home state and find Tennessee to be a better fit.\u201d\nAnother trend Terrance has been seeing is an influx of multigenerational families relocating together.\n\u201cThey come all together and want several houses,\u201d she says of her out-of-state buyers. \u201cOr one moves, and down the road, a few more follow suit.\nWhere the new arrivals choose to settle in Nashville largely depends on their demographic and socioeconomic profile. Young professionals on a budget are typically looking to buy condos under $1 million, with amenities in or near the bustling downtown area, where they can be close to all the action, according to Ashton.\nMeanwhile, families with kids are usually in the market for single-family homes with half-acre to 1-acre lots in the suburbs, where properties go for over $1 million.\nAnd deep-pocketed transplants seeking more acreage and privacy often set their sights on towns like\u00a0Belle Meade\u00a0and\u00a0Leiper\u2019s Fork, where homes usually sell for upward of $3 million.\nFiore predicts that as home prices and property taxes continue to climb in California, individuals and businesses alike will be flocking to Nashville for a more affordable and \u201cenjoyable\u201d lifestyle.\n\u201cFor what you buy a 1,000-square-foot starter home for in L.A., you could be buying a great home with land in\u00a0Brentwood\u00a0or Franklin,\u201d notes Fiore, referring to two upscale Nashville suburbs.\nAdvertisement",

        "subhead": "",
        "content": "The past two years have seen a slowdown in housing production in Greater Boston, as the number of new homes permitted has plummeted due to economic constraints. Now, it may be getting worse. In its quarterly report issued this month, the real estate firm Colliers said the share of housing inventory under construction in the region fell to a 10-year low in the first quarter of 2025. That means very little housing is being built, in comparison to the typical pace over the last decade. It\u2019s a sign that Greater Boston\u2019s multi-year slowdown in permitting of new apartment projects is beginning to show in the number of projects that are actually underway or finishing construction. \u201cAll of the economic factors that have slowed construction over the last two years are still impacting the market,\u201d said Jeff Myers, research director at Colliers. \u201cAnd while none of this is necessarily new at this point, all of those things are compounding, and we\u2019re seeing fewer projects getting to the point of breaking ground.\u201dRelated: A 10,000-unit housing development at Suffolk Downs is on hold indefinitely. Here\u2019s why.AdvertisementAfter a surge in new apartments permitted in 2021 and 2022, housing production has fallen significantly as the economy has shifted. The two main drivers of that slowdown are rising construction costs and interest rates. Construction costs surged during the pandemic and still have not returned to pre-pandemic rates, meaning the cost of materials needed for building is significantly higher than it was a few years ago. The rise in interest rates starting in early 2022 has made it more expensive for developers to secure construction loans. And the investors who finance much of the region\u2019s housing construction are demanding higher returns because they now view housing as a riskier investment due to the high cost of building. So builders now need their projects to earn more, while dealing with higher costs for materials and debt. AdvertisementIn other words, every piece of the financing for new housing has become more expensive.The result is that the Boston area had just over 11,000 units under construction at the end of the first quarter, according to Colliers, roughly 36 percent below the second quarter of 2022, the post-pandemic peak for construction. Other projects have been permitted but haven\u2019t started construction because they couldn\u2019t secure financing. Those numbers concern developers, because they indicate that the region may be coming to the end of the wave of projects that were permitted in 2021 and 2022. Since permitting has been low in the years since, few projects are slated to come online in the next couple of years. Related: \u2018The numbers should work, and they just don\u2019t\u2019: Is Cambridge\u2019s affordable housing rule backfiring?Indeed, the number of new units permitted so far in 2025 continues to lag the region\u2019s historical average. Through the first four months of the year, just 3,022 new units were permitted in Greater Boston, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Building Permit Survey. That number was 4,095 in 2024, and 5,920 in 2022.And when few units are built, demand for housing is amplified and rents stay high. \u201cWe are still in a housing crunch,\u201d said Myers. \u201cAnd there is significant demand in this region.\u201dAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

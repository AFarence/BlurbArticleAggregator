        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nAfter six years of fighting, residents of the Fairlawn Estates in Mattapan can breathe a sigh of relief: their market-rate homes will permanently become affordable.\n\u201cBy securing these homes as permanently affordable, we are continuing our efforts to make Boston a home for everyone and ensuring that families can continue to live and thrive in their neighborhood without the fear of being priced out,\u201d Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement.\nIn anannouncementon Monday, the city said it invested $10 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to support Related Beal\u2019s acquisition of the Fairlawn Estates, permanently converting the housing to affordable homes.\nThe investment is also part of the city\u2019sAcquisition Opportunity Program, which helps developers buy and preserve existing affordable housing.\nThe acquisition was possible through city funds, private investment, and loans. The newly created Boston Acquisition Fund provided a nearly $1 million commitment.\nThe Fairlawn Estates comprises 12 apartment buildings and a leasing office on Fairlawn Avenue, Cummins Highway, and Bismarck Street.\nThe release said the Flatley Companies constructed the complex in the 1960s, and it was known for its affordability. However, in 2018, that all changed when the long-awaited commuter rail stop opened across from the apartment complex. The building was sold to an investor group, and the property was rebranded as SoMa at the T. Residents faced increased rents, which resulted in evictions.\nThe new owner, Related Affordable, an affiliate of Related Beal, has committed to permanently restricting all 347 units to affordable housing.\n\u201cAffordable housing is core to Related\u2019s DNA, and we are thrilled to provide a more sustainable living solution in such an important, transit-oriented location in Mattapan,\u201d said Kimberly Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal.\nThe release said Related Affordable plans to invest $6.4 million in immediate repairs and building upgrades, including roof replacements, balcony repairs, and appliance upgrades in all apartments. Related Affordable will also focus on making the buildings more energy efficient.\nThe investment will ensure that half the apartments are for households earning no more than 60% of the Area Median Income, while the other half are for those earning no more than 80%.\nThe agreement with Related also limits rent increases to no more than 2% per year and provides ongoing support for households with housing vouchers.\nThe conversion to affordable housing follows years of advocacy and organizing by Fairlawn tenants, City Life/Vida Urbana, and neighbors in Mattapan.\n\u201cThe constant stress of facing huge rent increases and eviction weighed on us every day over the past six years, and it wasn\u2019t right \u2014 but we want people to know that housing is a human right and we can win the homes we deserve,\u201d said Betty Lewis, of the Fairlawn Tenant Association. \u201cThis is a community victory won by neighbors working together.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "subhead": "You\u2019ll be waiting a while. Empty nesters aren\u2019t flying the coop anytime soon.",
        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nBaby boomers own a significant chunk of the housing stock in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t count on that changing to solve the housing shortages anytime soon.\n\nBaby boomers \u2014 those from age 58 to 76 \u2014 accounted for nearly 39 percent of the homeowner pool statewide in 2023, according to Redfin\u2019s most recent data.\n\nNationwide, about 21 million homes are \u201cempty nests\u201d \u2014 those with at least three bedrooms and occupied by residents 55 and up with no children at home,according to Zillow.That has the potential to more than make up for the estimated 4.5 million unit national home shortage.\n\nBut for all the talk of a pending \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of generational wealth \u2014 and housing \u2014 transfer to younger demographics, experts caution this won\u2019t be a flash flood of supply.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in our industry have been thinking about this idea that there would be maybe a big wealth transfer, that maybe there would be a lot of baby boomers [with homes] coming on the market at some point,\u201d saidOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. \u201cBut unfortunately, our research shows that there\u2019s just not enough of those older families.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers also are staying in their homes longer than ever, meaning you likely shouldn\u2019t expect a sudden jolt of new supply:40 percent of American baby boomershave lived in their current homes for at least 20 years, according to Redfin.\n\nRedfin also noted empty-nest baby boomers owned 25 percent of large homes (those with at least three bedrooms) in Greater Boston in 2022 \u2014 compared to millennials with children owning just 12.5 percent of the supply.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s keeping these older homeowners parked in their current abodes rather than downsizing? Money talks, but the high cost of moving \u2014 especially when it pertains to higher mortgage rates compared to what they might have on their existing homes \u2014 has caused many to decide not to leave their longtime homes.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of baby boomersnationally planned to age in place, an increasingly standard plan for older homeowners, according to Redfin.\n\nEmpty nests would need to be more concentrated in markets with the largest housing shortages \u2014 like Greater Boston \u2014 to make a dent in home prices. But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn the local market, Zillow notes there are 281,773 empty nests, or about 14 percent of the local housing supply. That\u2019s slightly less than the 16 percent national average of empty nests found coast to coast.\n\n\u201cBoston is a younger place, and there\u2019s just not enough of these older homes available, even if all of them came on the market someday,\u201d Divounguy said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just empty nesters occupying larger homes that\u2019s driving some of the supply shortage.\n\n\u201cMany baby boomers have had very prosperous careers, and that has led to many of them owning multiple properties, whether it be that they own a primary residence and secondary for vacationing, or perhaps a primary and then also in owning investment properties as part of their portfolio,\u201d saidSarah Gustafson, president of theMassachusetts Association of Realtors. \u201cWith that, they\u2019re taking up so much of that available inventory, it\u2019s exacerbating the housing shortage that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nMany older homeowners just prefer to stay where they are.\n\n\u201cThe most common reasons [for baby boomers deciding to age in place] are that people like where they live and that there is no good alternative for them,\u201d saidChen Zhao, economics research lead at Redfin. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it boils down to.\u201d\n\nThink of the pending generational wealth and housing supply transfer more like a trickle than a tsunami, according to the Redfin team. Higher mortgage rates and home prices increase the supply shortage in a market like Greater Boston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long while coming,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cBoston has probably one of the tighter home markets and is one of the places where it seems like the market is frozen.\u201d\n\nThere are a mix of policy levers a region like Greater Boston can pull to help younger generations with housing accessibility and affordability. Governor Maura Healey\u2019sUnlocking Housing Production Commissionexamined the state\u2019s housing shortage and notedsingle-family-only zoning is a key obstacle, blocking more housing construction.\n\nThe commission recommended eliminating single-family zoning across the state in a move that wouldn\u2019t ban single-family homes from being constructed. Instead, the measure would prohibit municipal governments from blocking many multi-unit housing proposals on residential lots.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not to wait and hope for existing homes to come on the market. It\u2019s to help the builders build more housing,\u201d Zillow\u2019s Divounguy said. \u201cBoston happens to be one of the more restrictive markets in terms of building restrictions. It means loosening some of these building restrictions in the metro area and allowing for more construction.\u201d\n\nThere also are much longer-term solutions to some of the housing shortage. Baby boomers and millennials are larger generations, and that presents a multigenerational need for housing.\n\nBut declining birth rates in the US and expected lower immigration rates also can mean decreased housing demand in the distant future \u2014 emphasis on distant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen immediately, but at some point this does make a difference for housing demand and our housing shortage,\u201d Zhao said.\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

The property, whichDebby Beltof Hammond Residential Real Estate has listed for an even $20,000,000, is on the market for the first time since\u00a02007.\nThe Brookline property encompasses 4.5 acres, with a main residence, cottage, and apartment over the detached garage. During the more than 15 years that the current owners have held the property, they have opened their doors to those in need, such as medical patients receiving care in Boston and, since 2020, Afghan refugees.\nThe estate offers six bedrooms, five full bathrooms, and three half bathrooms in 7,550 square feet of space, with interiors designed by Ronald Bradshaw. The design does not shy away from color or pattern, with vibrant wallpaper and window treatments in many of the rooms.The first of three floors in the main house includes a double living room with views of the grounds. The primary suite, as well as two additional bedrooms and an office, are on the second floor. The owner\u2019s space includes a private deck, dressing area, and walk-in closet. There are three more bedrooms on the third floor.\nThe property\u2019s sweeping grounds are home to a substantial terrace patio, koi pond, tennis court, and putting green. There\u2019s a heated in-ground swimming pool and a cabana with amenities such as a shower room, kitchenette, and stereo equipment.\nThe cottage on the Brookline property includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a one-car garage, and skylights. The final living space is a two-bedroom unit above the home\u2019s separate four-car garage. Two of the four garage bays are currently used as a gym, one of which has a powder room.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nWant to park in the heart of Beacon Hill? It\u2019ll cost you \u2014 $750,000, to be exact.\nA coveted spot in the Brimmer Street Garage is now up for sale, offering a rare chance to own a piece of prime city real estate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pure luxury purchase,\u201d said Rene Rodriguez, the senior vice president of Cabot and Company, the listing agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. It\u2019s not like everyone can go shopping at Hermes or take private jet travel.\u201d\n\u201cBut I get it though, because it is outrageous to a certain extent,\u201d Rodriguez continued. \u201cBut, if you have the money to do it, it\u2019s very convenient.\u201d\nLast year, thegarage had three to four transfers, with the highest-priced spot selling for around $565,000. However, several transfers were for only $1 because they were tacked onto a house sale, making it difficult to determine their market value.\nOften, owners sell the spaces privately, so when they do go to market, \u201cthey always create a splash,\u201d said Rodriguez.\nRodriguez said that private transactions sometimes leave money on the table. In this case, the sellers of the parking spot decided to see what they could get on the market.\nMany of the homes on Beacon Hill lack parking spaces, leaving residents with few options for covered, off-street parking, creating a competitive market.\nThe price of parking at the Brimmer Street garage has consistently increased year over year. Rodriguez said the spots first came on the market in the 1970s, and they were going for $7,500 per spot.\n\u201cBut a lot has changed since then,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nHousing prices have also dramatically increased, with many places going for millions \u2014 often without parking.\nRodriguez noted that at those costs, what\u2019s another $750,000 for the convenience of having a parking spot? Plus, it would increase the home\u2019s resale value.\nThe buyer does get some perks. In addition to being a place to park a car, the parking is all valet, it has a filling and charging station, and attended staff can wash the car.\nBut there are ongoing costs beyond buying the deeded spot itself. HOA fees apply, and because the spots are categorized as individual condominiums, they incur additional taxes. Altogether, Rodriguez said it\u2019s about $900 a month.\nBut if you\u2019re not lucky enough to snag a spot at the Brimmer Street Garage, there are the LAZ Charles Street Garage and the Boston Common garages nearby. But both are public, with no valet, and you\u2019ve got to compete with other drivers for limited spaces.\nOr, one can look for street parking.\nEither way, \u201cthe Brimmer Street garage is in a better location,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more exclusive, private parking situation.\u201d\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\nBe civil.

        "subhead": "A year after a landmark settlement called for a disruption in how real estate agents are paid, people say they still feel forced to pay them excessive commissions.",
        "content": "By Debra Kamin, New York Times Service\n\nWhen Mike Chambers was ready to sell his house in Boulder, Colorado, last month, he interviewed a handful of real estate agents who promised he could fetch $2.75 million or more if he listed with them.\n\nBut the promise would come at a cost: Each agent wanted him to pay a commission of at least 5%, or $137,500.\n\nFrustrated that not a single agent was willing to budge on the rate, Chambers, 39, decided to sell his house on his own, and he took to social media with the handle @realtorshateme to chronicle the process. His reels drew 50,000 views or more.\n\nWithin days, local agents were making their own social media posts that countered his points \u2014 an action Chambers described as an aggressive campaign aimed at preventing him from making a sale on his own.\n\nCall it the Realtor recoil.\n\nOne year after theNational Association of Realtors agreed, as part of a legal settlement, to change a key rule on real estate commissions \u2014 a rule that had long uphelda tradition of commissionsbetween 5% and 6%, little has changed.\n\nWhat was hailed as a watershed has so far produced a mere drizzle.\n\nSome economists predicted the rule change would upend the business model and bring competition to a long-stilted marketplace, breaking the standard 6% rate \u2014 one of the highest rates in the world \u2014 and forcing down home prices as a result.\n\nThough average commissions appear to be slipping, industry watchdogs say that Realtors and their brokerages have used workarounds and pressure on sellers like Chambers to subvert the settlement. So far, they\u2019re finding success.\n\n\u201cThe industry understood the threat to 5 or 6% rates right away, so looked for opportunities to discourage negotiation,\u201d said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Policy Center, who has been vocal about the need for greater consumer awareness in the real estate industry.\n\nReal estate commissions in the United States have long been baked into a home\u2019s listing price and then paid by the seller to their agent. The agent would then split that payout with the agent who brought a buyer, usually with 2.5% to 3% for each.\n\nThe rate of the commission split was communicated on private listing databases available only to agents, called multiple listing services, and in the lawsuit that led to the settlement,a group of home sellers in Missouriargued that the covert sharing of rates led to a lack of transparency about whom, and how much, home sellers were required to pay. They also argued it inflated fees.\n\nA jury agreed, and NAR and the brokerages were ordered to pay nearly $2 billion in damages. The settlement came five months later, with the NAR agreement to end the practice of commission-sharing over MLS databases as part of the deal. NAR also agreed to pay$418 million to settle the claims, and some brokerages separately settled for millions of dollars.\n\nAfter a six-month reprieve, the NAR rule changebecame official in August 2024. Average commissions dropped from 5.64% to 4.96% in the months that followed, which means a drop in commission of $2,870 on a median-priced home, according to a survey of 1,300 agents conducted by RISMedia, a real estate media company. (Two other studies, conducted by the online brokerage Redfin and the cloud-based real estate accounting firm AccountTech, found commissions have not changed, but those results could be considered biased because both organizations have a stake in the results.)\n\n\u201cThe system has been in place for 100 years. It\u2019s not going to change overnight,\u201d said Michael Ketchmark, the lawyer who represented the Missouri homeowners. \u201cIt\u2019s not like one day we started streaming movies and then Blockbuster video stores were suddenly gone. It was a slow progressive change in technology and that\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing here.\u201d\n\nMany agents say that since the settlement, they\u2019ve felt cornered by buyers and sellers alike to defend their value. Jeremy Larsen, a Realtor in Dallas, said that consumers who decide to navigate the home market without an agent are taking huge risks with their money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like walking into a courtroom without an attorney. Why would you do that? There\u2019s so many possible things that can go wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nOne viral Instagram video, created last month by a Realtor in Fresno, California, with 114,000 followers, shows a man driving down a suburban cul-de-sac and encountering a seller\u2019s agent standing outside a house for sale with a sign that reads \u201c0 percent\u201d \u2014 referring to the amount of commissions the sellers were willing to pay any agent who brought a buyer.\n\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nAt the house next door, also for sale, an agent holds a sign that reads \u201c3 percent.\u201d The man pulls over and says he\u2019d like to take a look.\n\nThe video may have been a joke, but its message was clear: Many agents, now banned from making offers of commission to each other on private Realtor-only databases, are not adapting to the intent of the settlement. Rather than encouraging buyers to now negotiate rates on their own, they continue to press sellers to offer commissions of 5% 6%, and then discuss commission splits among themselves.\n\nThose commission splits are largely happening the old-fashioned way: phone, email and text. In one TikTok video viewed by The New York Times, a real estate coach in Virginia with 60,000 followers, trains her viewers on how to build a landing page for each of her listings that sends automated messages to buyers\u2019 agents informing them of the commission they will receive if they bring a buyer.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n\u201cIt only took a matter of weeks really, for most agents to find a loophole. It\u2019s almost a joke,\u201d said Nick Aufenkamp, a Realtor in Washington who started a coaching business, DIY Homebuyer Academy, after the settlement to help buyers learn how to represent themselves in real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to see any change in this industry,\u201d Aufenkamp said. He estimates he has coached 30 clients who wanted to represent themselves in a home purchase and ran into a wall.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe National Association of Realtors \u201cis resolutely opposed to any attempt to circumvent the settlement,\u201d said a spokesperson, Troy Green, who added that any attempts from agents to influence buyers\u2019 or sellers\u2019 decisions in order to gain more commission \u201cis unequivocally not something that NAR condones.\u201d The organization has a fact sheet on its website explaining that steering is a violation of their code of ethics.\n\nBut Green added that the settlement \u201cexpressly allows\u201d agents to communicate offers of commission between each other on venues outside of the MLS databases.\n\nAnd there lies the rub, said Doug Miller, a Minnesota lawyer who five years ago brought one of the first lawsuits over inflated commissions to Cohen Milstein, a Chicago law firm.\n\n\u201cThe NAR settlement solves MLS steering. It did not solve steering,\u201d he said. \u201cSharing is caring. Unless you\u2019re a Realtor, and then it\u2019s collusion.\u201d\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nSome agents have turned to the legislative process to protect commission sharing. A few months after NAR lost its lawsuit, Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Rosino, a former broker, co-sponsored a bill requiring agents on both sides of a transaction to share their fees in writing. With the support of Oklahoma\u2019s influential Realtor association, that bill passed, and went into effect, in May.\n\nThe New York Times interviewed 15 buyers and sellers across the country, from Colorado to Ohio to Arizona and beyond, who said they were blocked out of the market when they tried to negotiate commissions, or navigate transactions without a real estate agent.\n\nIn Boulder, Chambers\u2019 home listing caught the eye of a local real estate agent, Lindsay Alfano. Alfano, 25, has been an agent for two years. She said Chambers had promised to pay a buyer\u2019s agent commission, and she told fellow agents at her brokerage, eXp, that she was planning to show the house to her buyers.\n\nShe received text messages mocking her and encouraging her to change course. The Times reviewed the messages.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working for free,\u201d one colleague said.\n\n\u201cSell your own listings,\u201d another wrote. \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nAlfano described her peers\u2019 reaction as eye-opening. \u201cThe amount of people that were so scared of this guy having access to what we do was a rude awakening for me,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe word is steering. If you\u2019re worried how much you\u2019re going to get paid based on the home that your client loves, you\u2019re doing it for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nChambers found a buyer in early March and his home is now under contract. He is now focused, he said, on building a new company that he says \u201cwill disrupt the real estate industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to pay someone for their services, of course, but I don\u2019t want to just light money on fire because there\u2019s a system that\u2019s forcing me to,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\n\nBe civil.

        "content": "By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\n\nHouses in New England are a special breed. Plenty of them are more than 100 years old, while others make the most of narrow floor plans on tiny lots. Historic districts, zoning restrictions, and other guardrails can add layers of red tape while renovating or expanding these homes.\n\nTo work around some of these rules, builders and architects have had to get creative \u2014 whether that\u2019s carving out additional storage space from some unused corner or transforming an oddly shaped nook into something more useful. Ahead, find three unique home projects that maximize each home\u2019s nooks and crannies.\n\n\nWhen Rajiv Raman set out to convert the garage of his 1870s Somerville home into another bedroom, he knew he might encounter a few challenges. For one, working within the home\u2019s small footprint would be complex, and removing and adding walls was likely to affect other parts of the house.\n\nThat was the case in Raman\u2019s small kitchen, which needed to be expanded to connect the garage to the main house. The problem? The only wall offering natural light into the space needed to go. \u201cWe knew that we would have to get rid of the bay window in our kitchen, but we didn\u2019t want to just wall it off,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe wanted to create some other source of light in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nSo he brainstormed with his architect, Patrick Rettig, to find a unique solution: Building a \u201cskylight nook\u201d as an additional lounge area for his two kids, with rows of windows to let sunlight into the kitchen. Now, this 5\u00bd-foot-tall bump-out is a place for the kids to play games, kick back with their Nintendo Switch or iPad, and do homework.\n\nSince the three windows on the wall looked directly out to their neighbor\u2019s roof deck, Raman attached window clings to create a frosted effect for privacy. For added customization, he ordered carpet fragments to cover the back of the built-in bench below the nook.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also this company on Amazon where you can just send them exact dimensions of very odd-shaped benches, and they\u2019ll custom make a cushion,\u201d he said, so he plopped the custom cushions on the bench to complete the new dining area created by the nook. The built-in bench and accompanying table freed up precious square footage in the kitchen, too.\n\n\u201cNow we have a kitchen you can actually walk around in,\u201d Raman said. \u201cIt really opened up the space by Somerville standards.\u201d\n\n\nRenovation projects located in historic districts naturally come with constraints. For his clients who lived in a half-Cape in Provincetown, Chris Brown, principal and founder ofb Architecture studio, knew the challenge was optimizing the home\u2019s original footprint without expanding it.\n\n\nThe first floor, in particular, was in desperate need of creative storage solutions. To find a place for everyday essentials, Brown modified the home\u2019s central staircase, building full-depth drawers below them for shoes and other mudroom accessories. Two triangular and two rectangular drawers are now equipped with heavy-duty drawer glides, allowing them to hold considerable weight.\n\n\nJust around the corner, the team also built an appliance storage cubby on the remaining underside of the staircase. Each cubby was custom-sized and built to fit both the coffee maker and microwave, effectively preventing them from cluttering the countertops.\n\n\u201cAnd then we still had a little bit of leftover space, and the clients asked \u2018What about a small wine fridge?\u2019\u201d Brown said. He devised a way to squeeze an eight- to 12-bottle wine fridge in the remaining nook. Now, Brown reasoned, the clients can enjoy an ideal use of that space.\n\n\u201cMaybe half of our projects, sometimes more, are dealing with at least some existing conditions, and certainly zoning and square footage constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love doing these types of creative, fun built-ins that let us think a little differently about what that space could be.\u201d\n\n\nWhile expanding their primary bathroom, the owners of a duplex in Charlestown were presented with a small conundrum: They needed to encroach into the floor plan of the adjoining guest bedroom \u2014 unevenly.\n\n\n\u201cIt became an odd footprint,\u201d explained Dennis Duffy, principal ofDuffy Design Group, since the expanded bathroom left an angular \u201chole\u201d in the bottom section of the wall.\n\nAt the same time, Duffy said the clients were keen to have a place where their guests could relax on their own, either to watch TV or read. The solution then materialized: The extra space could be converted into a \u201cpit\u201d for reading and relaxing, as well as additional sleeping space for visiting children. (Later, a TV was installed in the nook.)\n\n\u201c[The clients] loved the solution of the modular \u2018pit,\u2019\u201d Duffy said. They enthusiastically agreed to a graphic treatment off the interior wall, featuring strips of wood and offset disk light fixtures.\n\nAs for what to relax upon, the team selected a layout with cushions inspired byRoche Bobois\u2019s iconicMah Jong collection, a modular sofa that can be converted into countless different shapes.\n\nThe result is a cozy relaxation pit balancing equal parts comfort and style.\n\n\u201cHaving begun my career in New York City, I\u2019m used to working with small spaces,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI learned early on to try to find the best functional solutions for spaces like this, as long as it stays on message with the concept and adds functionality.\u201d\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\n\nThat stubborn, dirt-flecked pile of snow in the shady corner of my garden serves as an unwelcome reminder of the winter season, now only a few weeks from coming to an official end. Sunshine and warmer temperatures this past week have lifted my spirits nearly as much as seeing the first of the blooming snowdrops I planted last year push through the earth. Students of nature will have observed the buds swelling on trees and shrubs, while the bud scales of early blooming willows shyly reveal their silvery, furry flower buds underneath.\n\nWe are on the cusp of spring returning to New England. Gardeners recognize the invigorating energy, the drive to return outside that spring awakens within us. Whether you have started seeds in your basement, greenhouse, or kitchen, the excitement is palpable.\n\nMy thoughts now turn to bed preparation, clean up of winter debris, and cutbacks of last year\u2019s stems. Here are a few things to consider as you get ready for spring cleanup.\n\nLeaving stems standing over winter has loads of benefits, from protecting the crown of the plant, providing habitat and nesting for bees and other wildlife, as well as extending the aesthetic interest of your garden. But now that winter is almost over, when is it safe to cut those stems back? A good rule of thumb is to wait until you observe flying insects in your garden. In our area, that\u2019s usually from late March into early April, depending on the weather trends.\n\nFor mulch, I like to leave as much leaf litter in the beds as possible in the fall while collecting leaves from the lawn into a pile. If I have time and motivation, I may run them over with the lawn mower to chop them smaller. That pile of composting leaves is now a great source to top-dress any sections of planting beds blown bare by winter winds. Smaller pieces are easy to work with around the emerging stems, leaves, and blossoms of spring bulbs and perennials.\n\nFor some tips on bed preparation, let us turn to a reader question:\n\nQ.This spring, I plan to move a 6-foot-long by 3-foot-deep bed of hydrangeas about 4 feet behind their current location. The new location currently is overrun with various wild woodland plants/weeds. The new location is lower than the current bed, and I will fill it with about 3 to 4 feet of new loam. Once transplanted, I will add about 3 inches of mulch.\n\nMy question is: Should I use a herbicide to kill current, unwanted undergrowth before filling with new loam? Will using a herbicide create a risk to the transplanted hydrangeas? Will simply adding 4 to 4 feet of new loam on top of existing wild plants stifle any new growth without applying herbicide?\n\nKevin,Natick\n\nA.The tenets ofintegrated pest management(IPM) teach us to approach pest or weed management in an environmentally sensitive manner. The first step is to observe and learn about your problem. Our reader has identified unwanted plants that may threaten his plans to establish a new bed. Before reaching for the herbicide, let\u2019s consider a few nontoxic solutions that would solve the problem without using chemicals.\n\nThe next step in this scenario would be to consider a physical barrier to smother the unwanted plants. Given the amount of loam planned to be added on top, I would put down a layer of cardboard first before the loam is piled on. While the herbicide might not impact the hydrangeas, it will affect the beneficial life found in the loam. Soil is alive with countless organisms that help break down and repackage organic matter into forms that plants can use. Keeping your soil healthy will keep your garden growing abundantly.\n\nIf you believe the weeds to be especially tenacious, you can escalate the solution to nontoxic herbicides that use active ingredients like vinegar, citric acid, or botanical oils.Arbico Organicsis a great source for these types of products. Organic herbicides are safe to use around people and pets and will not affect the soil kingdom.\n\nAfter exhausting all other alternatives, then and only then, consider turning to chemical herbicides. The IPM approach ensures that we continue to move away from the days of blanket spraying your plants to the use of organic products delivered with very targeted applications using the smallest amount needed. Happy spring, my fellow gardeners, I hope to see you over the garden gate soon!\n\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

It features sliding doors that open out to the main deck. The dining area is off the 320-square-foot kitchen, which has an integrated refrigerator and high-gloss white cabinets. A gray stone island anchors the space, which has same pale hardwood flooring that runs throughout the home.

This home in coastal Winthrop\u2019s Cottage Park neighborhood is the right size for anyone looking to downsize.\n\nFor those looking to enjoy their leisure time, this antique home that\u2019s been updated isless than a half-mile from the Winthrop Golf Clubandless than a mile from Winthrop Beach.\n\nFrom the driveway, a stairwell on the right side of the house leads up to the farmer\u2019s porch, which is about 24 feet long and nearly 5 feet wide. The decking is composite.Under it is a sizablestorage area with a decorative panel door.\n\n\nThe front door opens into the 88-square-foot foyer that includes a stairwell to the second floor on the right. Directly ahead is the kitchen, but a left turn is the right choice at this point. Moving through the doorway leads into the 149-square-foot living room.\n\nThere are three double-hung windows on two exterior walls, white oak hardwood flooring (as in the foyer), and a cooling fan in the center of the ceiling. An accent wall is covered with wood-like paneling. A cast iron radiator is in one corner of the room, carrying warmth during the cold months through hot water/steam via a gas boiler.\n\n\nA wide opening leads into the dining room. It\u2019s 136 square feet, and has thin crown molding with a wood-like appearance. There are two double-hung windows on the two exterior walls, hardwood flooring, and an antique period medallion as the central light fixture. The current owner has placed a table with seating for six. On the right side, there is a wide pass-through into the kitchen, and at the end of the room is a custom-built China cabinet that is original to the 145-year-old home.\n\n\nKitchens are considered the heart of the home, and this iteration absolutely qualifies. It\u2019s visible from the front foyer, can be entered from the driveway, and there\u2019s a clear glass slider to the backyard.\n\nThe kitchen\u2019s 256 square feet is gallery style and hasSamsung stainless steel smart appliancesand white ceramic tile flooring. Entering from the foyer, two levels of wooden white cabinets appear on the right, with square white tiles for the backsplash that have black line cuts throughout. The counters are gray laminate. The sink is under a window, followed by the gas range, and above it, the microwave. There are barstools on the other side of the pass-through to the dining room that provides a casual bar eating area.\n\n\n\nThe stairwell connects to the upper floor, the two bedrooms, and the full bath.\n\nThe 39-square-foot updated bath uses sandy brown porcelain tile to create a welcoming environment that suggests a day at the beach, while a rectangular skylight provides sunny skies. A shower curtain guards the white porcelain tub and brown-toned backsplash. The oak natural wood-stained single vanityis topped by a white porcelain sink and counter.The porcelain tile flooring is beige with an Italian marble style.\n\n\nThe two bedrooms are near mirror images of each other, although the primary is larger and has more windows.\n\nLocated at the rear of the home, the primary is 239 square feet and features a large skylight with a curtain set into the cathedral ceiling. There is a large closet and double-hung windows on three exterior walls. The flooring is hardwood.\n\n\nThe second bedroom is 165 square feet and also has a skylight. The closet has white bifold doors and a pair of double-hung windows in the front of the home.\n\n\nThe basement is 442 square feet.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nAnyone who has ever taken a field trip to Salem will recognize the name tied to 252 Essex Street in Beverly, which is currently on the market for $600,000.\nGiles Corey, a farmer accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials, pleaded \u201cnot guilty.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d achieve a fair trial and refused to speak. He was subsequently sentenced to death by pressing\u00a0and became one of the most notable figures from the witch trials with the phrase he repeated as he died: \u201cMore weight.\u201d According to legend, that\u2019s what Corey repeatedly said to his executioners as they added more stones on top of him. (He was also written as a character in Arthur Miller\u2019sThe Crucible.)\nThe four-bed, two-bath property, which was first built in 1675 and underwent a variety of transformations over the years,\u00a0belonged to William Cleaves, who was Corey\u2019s son-in-law.\nSet on .79 of an acre, the 2,315-square-foot home looks almost plucked out of Corey\u2019s era thanks to everything from the wide-plank pine floors to the well in the basement (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s on city water now).\nA few steps up, on the right side of the home, under a small porch, brings you into an 184-square-foot kitchen, the first space built in the home. It features green tile floors, an operational 1930s stove, and a walk-in pantry. There\u2019s also a door to an additional staircase to the second story. Next door is the second dining room, a 222-square-foot space featuring wood floors and a ceiling with beams that resemble logs. The remnants of a chimney stack sit in the corner. A 267-square-foot living room has wide plank floors and a fireplace that should be inspected before use. Two windows overlook the stunning gardens and street. A green door to the right of the fireplace leads to the downstairs bathroom, which features a shower. A door to the left of the fireplace moves into the foyer, home to the main entrance of the home.\nContinue through to the second dining room, a charming 241-square-foot space with a built-in hutch, beamed ceiling, and easy access to the back patio through a door. The main kitchen, a 169-square-foot space, is next door and has a washer/dryer that\u2019s included in the sale, track lighting overhead, and a door to the other front porch. A French door leads into a pantry, while a thinner French door leads to a mini pantry. Another door leads to the back patio.\nHead back into the foyer to access the main staircase to the second story, where you\u2019ll find each of the four bedrooms. The top of the staircase is also home to the second full bathroom, which has a tub. A bonus room measuring 239 square feet is a great addition to the second story, and a walk-up attic provides extra storage space.\nThe home features a fieldstone and dirt basement. There is also a separate 1-car garage that measures 344 square feet, as well as a storage space that measures 121 square feet.\nThe home\u2019s outdoor spaces are some of its greatest features. The backyard, which is partially protected by conservation restrictions, is filled with trees, giant rocks, and a treehouse. The front yard is home to beautiful gardens, where wisteria hangs, and garden plots outlined by stone are frequently noticed by passersby.\n\u201cThe gardens are something that almost everybody knows,\u201d saysDiantha Phosithanof Engel & V\u00f6lkers By the Sea, who has thelisting.\nThe home will need a new roof \u201cpretty much right away.\u201d\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByCameron Sperance\n\nThe Bay State might have the misfortune of being labeled \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d but experts point to how it\u2019s not as bad as itcouldbe from a property tax standpoint. That distinction goes to New Jersey \u2014 at least this year, anyway.\n\nStill, Massachusettshome buyersshouldn\u2019t be caught off guard by property tax increases, which can add even more financial stress to homeownership.\n\n\u201cOver time, property taxes have inched up, but I think it\u2019s really about how the counties and the state manage their financials,\u201d saidEllen Steinfeld, senior executive vice president of consumer lending and payments at Berkshire Bank.\n\nProperty taxes are what homeowners pay to their city or town based on the assessed value of their home and the municipal tax rate. This tax rate varies by community and largely depends on a municipality\u2019s financial status and spending levels.\n\nIf you average these tax rates,the effective property tax rateacross Massachusetts is 1.14 percent on every assessed dollar \u2014 making Massachusetts the 18th highest of any US state and the District of Columbia, according toRocket Mortgage.\n\nNew Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the country. Illinois, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut round out the top five, respectively.\n\nPlus,a study the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership and the Donahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, released Monday ranked the state 46th (from strongest to weakest) in the nation when it comes to state and local tax collections per capita as a competitive weakness.\nMore Fall House HuntThe fix is in. Shoppers flock to buy homes that need work.All the world\u2019s a stage, so make your home its starThe median home price in Mass. in July was $650k. Here\u2019s what that gets you now.\nRates can vary significantly within the state itself.\n\nAlmost one-third of Massachusetts municipalities have split property tax rates between commercial and residential dwellings, according to thePioneer Institute of Public Policy Research, a maneuver some states use to offset the high cost of housing with a reduced tax burden. This often means municipalities with higher commercial bases can have lower residential taxes.\n\nBucolic Wendell \u2014 with a municipal property tax rate of $22.15 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 had the highest rates in the state in fiscal 2024, according to theMassachusetts Department of Revenue. Chilmark on Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2014 at $2.12 per $1,000 of assessed value \u2014 has the lowest. Some communities like Boston also offer a residential tax exemption that \u201creduces your tax bill by excluding a portion of your residential property\u2019s value from taxation. Last fiscal year, the residential exemption will [have] saved qualified Boston homeowners up to $3,610.53 on their tax bill.\u201d\n\nCommercial and industrial property owners paid 58 percent of all property taxes in 2022 compared to 42 percent of residential property owners, per the Pioneer Institute report. But there is concern this balance could shift more toward residential property owners amid higher vacancy rates in commercial buildings following the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into property taxes, but generally, I don\u2019t see higher property taxes as a bad thing,\u201d saidDaryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cThe downside of having property taxes very low is that it makes housing a more appealing financial investment, and then that can crowd out first-time home buyers if investors are buying homes simply because it has favorable taxes.\u201d\n\nFurther, it\u2019s important for homeowners to keep tabs on how frequent towns reassess property values to avoid sticker shock.\n\n\u201cSome municipalities do their assessments frequently, so the changes aren\u2019t as big,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cSome will do assessments more sporadically, and then people can get pretty big shocks when they go and see how much their home has been reassessed for.\u201d\n\nA reassessment doesn\u2019t have to be the final verdict, however. You can contest an assessment by filing an abatement application with your local tax assessor\u2019s office for potential overvaluation. Further, senior citizens are eligible for property tax credits and exemptions.\n\nMassachusetts has a safeguard against municipalities going overboard with hikes: Proposition 2\u00bd prevents a town from raising the rate more than 2.5 percent a year without a majority override vote.\n\nThere was an expectation coming out of the pandemic thatoverride votes would increase amid rising inflationand dwindling government relief funds to cover budget shortfalls. That appears to be precisely what happened.\n\nProp 2\u00bd override votes are becoming increasingly common: Nearly 100 such votes have taken place in the past 18 months \u2014 the most seen in more than a decade, the Globe\u2019s James Vaznisreported in July. About two-thirds of them were successful.\n\nPerhaps the nickname \u201cTaxachusetts,\u201d at least when it comes to property tax hikes on the horizon, isn\u2019t such an overstatement after all.\n\nSend comments to[email\u00a0protected].\nAddress newsletterGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\nIf you\u2019re buying a condo, you\u2019ve probably reviewed the rules and regulations of the condominium association to confirm they don\u2019t conflict with your planned use of the property. But did you check out the association itself? Failing to ensure that the association\u2019s finances are healthy can lead to huge bills for unsuspecting unit owners.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that a buyer could have a special assessment in the thousands of dollars,\u2019\u2019 saidLinda Barrett, vice president of Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boston. \u201cShould the building\u2019s roof need to be replaced, you could end up with a very high special assessment if the association does not have good reserves.\u2019\u2019\nOwners of condominiums pay regular assessments, usually monthly or quarterly, to cover the operating expenses of the association, as well as reserves \u2014 funds stashed away for future capital projects. But condo associations also can charge unit owners special assessments for emergencies or unusual circumstances, such as damage to the building caused by a winter storm.\nThat\u2019s why Barrett always prepares her condo buyers beforehand. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure buyers not only review the condominium documents, but two years of the budget as well,\u2019\u2019 she said. When she writes an offer, she also includes a contingency allowing the buyer to review the minutes of association board meetings for the past two years. \u201cYou could read in the minutes from a year ago that there\u2019s a problem with the roof,\u2019\u2019 she said. That could signal that a special assessment is in your future.\nRelatedSticker shock: Special assessments can send condo costs even higher. What buyers should be asking.\n\nPrior to closing on a one-bedroom condominium in Boston\u2019s Seaport District two years ago, Anne Stemlar, a legal administrator in Boston, reviewed the association\u2019s financial statements. \u201cI was looking at the health of the organization and what kind of financial reserves they had,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nStemlar concluded that the association was well run, with healthy reserves, a capital budget, and a plan for improvements. But she had an advantage since she had owned two units previously and served on a condo association board of directors. First-time buyers should rely on their real estate agent and lawyer for help reviewing these documents. \u201cAsk a lot of questions, and make sure you come to a comfort level,\u2019\u2019 Stemlar said.\nIn addition to reviewing the rules and regulations of the association to ensure you won\u2019t be in violation if you own a large dog, drive a truck, or want to rent your unit, be sure to conduct the following due diligence on the financial stability of the association:\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the past two operating budgets, as well as two years\u2019 worth of board and annual meeting minutes. Be wary if assessments haven\u2019t increased over time; since the cost of goods and services have gone up, maintenance fees should have followed.\n\u25a0\u00a0Review the reserve study of the major capital components of the building, and make sure there are adequate funds to replace them on schedule.\n\u25a0\u00a0Ask questions. Dawn Bauman, senior vice president for government and public affairs at theCommunity Associations Institute, an industry group, said condo buyers should inquire about routine maintenance of the building, whether the board expects to increase assessments, and whether there is a current special assessment or one pending or imminent. Try to talk to the seller, the property manager, and board members.\n\u25a0\u00a0Be skeptical about the operating budget for new construction. Developers often subsidize the expenses of the association by paying costs such as landscaping or snow removal, so it\u2019s common for assessments to increase once the unit owners take control of the association.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t ignore insurance.Spencer M. Houldin, president of Ericson Insurance Advisors in Boston, suggested that condo buyers determine the insurance obligations of both the association and the unit owners. Typically, Houldin said, the association insures the building, while owners are responsible for everything inside their units. Have your insurance agent or lawyer review the association\u2019s insurance to make sure it\u2019s sufficient to rebuild the structure. All unit owners should carry anHO-6 policythat covers the interior of their units and liability.\n\u25a0\u00a0Don\u2019t waive your right to review association financials. \u201cIt\u2019s a seller\u2019s market, and buyers are willing to overlook things like reserves because they\u2019re just happy they found a place and their offer was accepted,\u2019\u2019 saidMichael Merrill, a real estate and condominium law attorney in Boston. But even if you waive mortgage and inspection contingencies, be wary of waiving a budget review.\n\u201cThat way, when you do become an owner, you\u2019re not surprised by the amount of money you may have to put in to solve a problem,\u2019\u2019 Merrill said.\nRobyn A.

        "content": "By Ann Carrns, New York Times Service\n\nWishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.\n\nBut many people don\u2019t realize myriad programs offer grants or loans to help home buyers come up with the necessary funds. \u201cThere are tons of programs to assist them,\u201d said Deatra Kemp, an advocate for first-time home buyers in Milwaukee.\n\nThe programs can ease some of the daunting numbers behind buying a house. The median price of a home has risen to more than $400,000, meaning the once-traditional 20 percent down payment \u2014 an amount paid in cash toward the purchase of a home, in addition to the amount borrowed for a mortgage \u2014 would be about $80,000. And typical house prices are significantly higher in some parts of the country like Massachusetts. The Warren Group reported Tuesday that the median sales price for a single-family home in the state hit $615,000 in December, a year-over-year jump of 11.1 percent. The median condo price in Massachusetts was $521,750, a 5 percent increase.\n\nEven putting down 5 percent to 10 percent is a stretch because rising rents have made it harder for people to save, said Teig Whaley-Smith, chief alliance executive for the Community Development Alliance, a nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes affordable homeownership as a path to racial equity. \u201cFor working families,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s next to impossible.\u201d\n\nPlus, increasing mortgage interest rates, which drive up monthly costs, don\u2019t help. Last week, rates fora 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose above 7 percentfor the first time since May, according toFreddie Mac, the federally backed mortgage finance giant.\n\nSonu Mittal, senior vice president and head of the single-family acquisitions division at Freddie Mac, said that outside of high prices and interest rates, which consumers can\u2019t control, raising a down payment \u201ccontinues to be the No. 1 barrier to homeownership.\u201d\n\nBut down-payment assistance options can help buyers come up with the necessary cash. When combined with loan programs that allow buyers to put less money down \u2014 as little as 3 percent of the home\u2019s purchase price, in some cases \u2014 the help can make buying a home a reality.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible in some cases to put no money down. Two federal government programs offer zero percent down-payment loans to borrowers who meet specific criteria. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers full financing for veterans and those on active military duty, and the Department of Agriculture guarantees zero percent down-payment loans in rural areas.\n\n\u201cTwenty-percent down is a myth,\u201d Kemp said. The typical down payment for first-time buyers in 2024 was 9 percent, according to theNational Association of Realtors. Yet the notion that higher down payments are needed persists. As a result, many people of modest means don\u2019t even consider the notion of owning a home, said Kemp, vice president of programs atActs Housing, a nonprofit that provides financial coaching and other services to help renters become homeowners.\n\nStill, finding the right assistance program isn\u2019t easy.A 2023 report from the Urban Institute,a nonprofit research group, identified more than 1,600 government programs across the country designed to help with down payments. Some are offered by the federal government, others by state housing finance agencies or county and local governments. Community-funded organizations and even commercial lenders may also offer help.\n\nMost, but not all, programs serve first-time buyers, and most set income limits for borrowers \u2014 typically based on the median income in the home\u2019s area. The dizzying assortment of programs, which have varying criteria and geographic restrictions, can make it challenging to identify and apply for available help.\n\n\u201cHome buyers don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Ashley Moore, community lending manager withChase Home Lendingin Houston.\n\nSome programs offer grants, which don\u2019t need to be repaid, but most offer help in the form of a low- or no-interest second mortgage, meaning there is additional debt on the home. Payments on the loans, however, are often deferred, meaning you don\u2019t have to start paying them back right away, and the loans may be forgiven if you remain in the home for a certain period of time \u2014 often five years.\nMore on home buyingMore home buyers are asking relatives for down payment helpMedian down payment tops $105k for metro Boston home buyersSpring House Hunt: Why you don\u2019t need 20% down to buy a home\nJung Hyun Choi, principal research associate for the Urban Institute\u2019s housing finance policy center, said borrowers may combine benefits of several different down-payment programs, a practice sometimes called \u201cstacking,\u201d to come up with the necessary funds. But it can take time and effort to find and apply for various programs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty complicated,\u201d she said, and can drag out the buying process.\n\nGroups like Acts Housing seek to help borrowers identify the right programs and often find that borrowers are eligible for more than one. \u201cWe love to stack,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nActs Housing recently worked with a buyer who was able to get $19,500 in down-payment assistance from a combination of grants from federal and private lenders and a city program, she said. The buyer put down less than $700 out of pocket at closing for a home in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cGet all the grants you deserve,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave any money on the table.\u201d\n\nThe borrower, Latoya Myrick, 44, who works in community services, said the assistance had enabled her to buy a duplex for about $200,000, realizing a longtime goal of owning her own home. She had tried before, she said, but didn\u2019t have enough for a down payment. She closed on Jan. 6 and will soon move in. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d\n\nOther resources are emerging to help home buyers find down-payment assistance. Freddie Mac in late 2023 began offering a free online search tool,DPA One,to help lenders and housing counselors match eligible borrowers with down-payment help.\n\n\u201cLoan officers may not even know there is a program available,\u201d Mittal said. \u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t miss those opportunities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say how many homes have been purchased because of the new offering, Mittal said, but the tool is gaining traction. About 7,000 loan officers use the tool, which now has information on about 800 programs across 50 states and the District of Columbia. (Home buyers can try DPA One, but it\u2019s mainly intended for professionals.)\n\nAnother option isDown Payment Resource, an online search tool. Borrowers enter details about themselves and the type of home they want and can get information about programs for which they may be eligible.\n\nYou can also contact your state housing finance authority or work with a housing counseling agency certified by the federalDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentto learn about available programs. You can search on the HUD website for agencies in your area.\n\n\nWill using a down-payment assistance program cause the interest rate on my loan to be higher?\n\nSome predatory lenders may charge a higher rate to borrowers using assistance programs, Kemp said. When that happens, counselors at certified housing agencies can work with buyers to find lenders who won\u2019t penalize borrowers using down-payment help, she said.\n\nCan I use a family gift to help with a down payment?\n\nLenders may allow gifts from close family members to be included as part of a down payment. In 2024, 8 percent of homebuyers (and 21 percent of first-time buyers) said they had used a gift from a relative or friend, according to the National Association of Realtors. You may need to provide a letter signed by the donor to document that the money doesn\u2019t need to be repaid, according to credit bureauExperian.\n\nDo private lenders offer assistance with down payments?\n\nSome do. Chase, for instance, offers grants of up to $7,500 in eligible areas, including federally identified neighborhoods with majority Black, Hispanic, or Latino populations, that can be used toward a down payment or to reduce a home loan\u2019s interest rate or closing costs.

        "content": "By Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\n\nWhen it comes to online gardening trends and how they translate to reality, mileage can vary.\n\n\u201cChaos gardening\u201d lit upTikToklast year, its advocates tossing fistfuls of seed into soil \u2014 or even grass \u2014 while seeming to hope fora wildflower meadow. There are reasons that a planned approach can yield more reliable results: crowding plants can outcompete one another, and not all seeds will thrive in every yard placement. But for some who practice it in the Boston area, chaos gardening is more than an online trend: It\u2019s a longtime mindset they say has helped them maintain a more forgiving relationship with their spaces, easing up on their expectations and enjoying the garden on its own terms.\n\n\u201cI do have ideas for what I want to grow, but whatever works,\u201d said Dana Werbin, who gardens in Jamaica Plain. \u201cIf a seed grows there, that means it likes the conditions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Werbin\u2019s approach lacks design: It\u2019s just that the garden is, to a greater extent than some, also the designer. Their \u201cvolunteer\u201d tomatoes \u2014 ones that sprout from dropped seeds, tend to do better than planted seedlings, for example.\n\n\u201cI could make the decision to rip it up and plant it elsewhere, but it already made the decision that it likes where it is, so I\u2019m not gonna mess that up,\u201d they said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s going to give me good tomatoes.\u201d\n\nWerbin\u2019s description of their garden is a picture of both chaos and order. They don\u2019t know exactly where something will grow, but the garden will let them know. That\u2019s where they will find the scallions this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a percentage of, like, 70 percent chaos, 30 percent order,\u201d they said.\n\nFor Kris Engdahl, the decision opened up a neighborhood conversation.\n\n\nShe sees her chaos garden approach as an outcropping ofmilpa gardening, a sustainable and regenerative indigenous practice related to the \u201cthree sisters\u201d method of planting corn, beans, and squash together. Engdahl\u2019s Watertown front yard received a lot of street salt, which seemed to encourage crabgrass. So, she tore it up and tried flowers: roses, marigolds, and impatiens. But her interest turned to growing food, and she thought,why not?She replaced flowers with a range of vegetables and herbs. Sometimes she added more flowers. Sometimes, tricolor chard. She followed her whims, and soon the garden followed its own.\n\n\nAs  it evolved, the garden\u2019s proximity to the sidewalk attracted interest. Located a short walk to a community path, the foot traffic is frequent. The variety became a magnetic conversation-starter. A group of passersby, with her permission, harvested cilantro. A woman took chard and returned the next day with a delicious recipe she made with it.\n\nWith each season, different plantings would express themselves with more or less influence. One year, Engdahl\u2019s garden was dominated by dill and daikon (white radish). Sometimes pumpkins popped up; sometimes green beans would thrive.\n\nAnd while it can feel that way to Engdahl, to its admirers, the garden was not independent from its gardener. Last year, Engdahl said she fell behind on maintenance \u2014 stymied, as we all experience \u2014 by life and the heat wave. And even during these cold intermediate months, someone checked in.\n\n\u201cI had somebody on Sunday [ask]: \u2018How are you doing? We love looking at your garden. I was concerned about you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes the balance will seem off in some way, and Engdahl will correct it. One season\u2019s parsley, which produced months of winter broths, became next season\u2019s rabbit food.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will do something, and it will be wrong, but gardens are dynamic,\u201d she said. She plans to continue this year, following up on her practice of \u201cno dig\u201d gardening, adding her own homemade compost.\n\nGarden designerDemetra Tseckareshas found the chaos gardening mindset useful when responding to clients who are looking for lower maintenance. Meadows are a great fit for replacing a sunny lawn. Tseckares will hand-seed the area, but is careful to select intentionally, avoiding pre-sold mixes that can often include invasive or aggressive plant species.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get people to understand what a beautiful garden looks like in a different way, because these super neat, super tidy \u2026 cleaned-up gardens that don\u2019t allow a single leaf or a single stem to stand are dead zones, they kill an entire generation,\u201d Tseckares said of the insects that may use stems and leaves for habitat, supporting other parts of the wildlife population.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a more sustainable approach \u2014 including financially.\n\n\u201cYou can change it every year, or it will just do its own thing,\u201d she said, noting that gardeners can harvest seeds at the end of the season for next year\u2019s plantings.\n\nWerbin\u2019s next season, like many gardeners, will begin well before the last frost. Using a small greenhouse, they will start seedlings during the cold season. But they also will practice experimental sowing with a packet of their own mixed seeds as an intentional surprise, to see what comes up.\n\nNot every experiment is fruitful. Last year, Werbin nurtured a plant they thought was ginger. It turned out to be grass.\n\n\u201cI was giving so much love to this weed, thinking that it was going to turn into something, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d they said.\n\nBut care and forgiveness are never wasted. Now Werbin, who has a professional horticulture background, is studying for a career pivot into nursing.\n\n\u201cCultivating a rapport with your patients is just like getting the soil ready,\u201d she said. Their approach to gardening required openness and nonjudgmental thinking. They talk to their plants. And they are carrying that practice into their nursing study.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the same student nurse, if I didn\u2019t have that experience,\u201d said Werbin.\n\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\u00a0protected].\n\n\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

(AP) \u2014A luxury home that had been on the verge of tumbling into Cape Cod Baydue to erosion has been demolished.\n\nA potential collapse of the 5,100-square-foot home threatened oyster beds in nearby Wellfleet Harbor, but a dispute over its removal had left it teetering on the edge of a sandy bluff for months. But on Monday, heavy machinery rolled in to remove the house piece by piece, with trucks carrying it away. By Tuesday, only its concrete slab, chimney and a generator remained.\n\n\u201cOn one side, it is sad because it was a beautiful house that became a landmark in that place,\u201d said John Cobler, a member of the Wellfleet Environmental Commission. \u201cOn the other, I am happy that it is gone. It is a great relief for our town and for our environment.\u201d\nA luxury house is close to tumbling into Cape Cod Bay. Will anyone stop it?\nCobler said attorneys for owner John Bonomi filed a request with the town last week to remove the house. An attorney for Bonomi declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nThe house was built in 2010 on the bay side of the Cape Cod peninsula. Its original owners sought permission in 2018 to build a seawall to stave off erosion. The commission rejected the seawall out of concern for unintended effects on the beach and how water carries nutrients in the bay. They also questioned whether it would save the house.\n\nIn 2019, Bonomi, a New York attorney, bought the house for $5.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the erosion advanced. A report prepared for Wellfleet last year estimated the house would fall down the bluff within three years, potentially sending debris into a harbor where shellfish farmers grow the town\u2019s namesake oysters, and the environment commission asked Bonomi for a plan to remove the house.\n\nJust a week before the demolition, strong winds battered the cape for three days, exposing more of the home\u2019s concrete pillars.\n\nAn attorney for Bonomi had told the commission at its January meeting that the house had been sold to a salvage company that would not fund removal of the house. But the town\u2019s conservation agent noted at the time that no transfer of deed had been recorded, and a check of records Tuesday also found no record of sale.\nSign up for the Today newsletterGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

        "content": "By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\n\nQ.Our next door neighbors recently installed a Mitsubishi heat pump system. We love the idea of heat pumps and have strongly considered installing one ourselves. However, our sleep at night and peace during the day have been destroyed ever since they started using their heat pump. Our house is getting hit with heavy, low frequency sound/vibrations. It sounds like a train or giant truck idling beside one\u2019s ear and sometimes the sound waves seem to harmonize to such a point that a long, almost groaning, vibratory pulse is heard and felt. The owners themselves do not seem to be effected, but the three fan/compressor units all face our house directly and everything is built on rock here. We suspect that the sound and vibrations are being transferred through the rock and resonating with our own home construction materials. Certain weather and atmospheric conditions seem to amplify and significantly worsen the sound. Have you heard of or experienced this issue and, if so, do you have any suggestions?\n\n\u2014\u00a0MICHELLE\n\nA.This is a tough one. There are a lot of opinions out there given that conditions vary from installation to installation. We have not encountered this problem yet. A few suggestions:\n\nSince many low-frequency noises are associated with vibrations, the easiest first pass would be to ask your neighbors to place vibration-dampening pads under the unit. That could help somewhat.\n\nOur HVAC company said that it is possible to have the fan blades changed to a more aerodynamic model/material. This is the most likely culprit, but is likely to be a costly fix.\n\nAnother option is to have a roof built over the units. We have done that before in certain instances, given that these heat pumps need to be kept clear of snow in the winter to operate properly. Your neighbors could insulate the roof frame with sound-deadening insulation like rock wool. If so, this could mitigate some of the low-frequency noise.\n\nQ.We have a wood stove inserted into our fireplace. We were told to have our chimney cleaned every four cords of wood. That is very different from your advice (How often should you have your chimney swept?, Jan. 19). Also my husband was diagnosed with a pulmonary disorder, so we are being more conscious of particulates in the air that would irritate his lungs. What are your thoughts on both of these?\n\n\u2014 SARAH\n\nA.I would not advise waiting until you burn four full cords of wood to clean your chimney. Especially if there is some soft woods like pine or spruce mixed in with your hardwoods. Soft woods leave far more creosote buildup than hardwoods like oak and maple. One of the reasons we suggest yearly cleaning for people who burn wood regularly is because it gets a professional\u2019s eye on your whole chimney. They clean it, inspect for animal infiltration, check the masonry, etc. It\u2019s like having a quality mechanic regularly looking under the hood of your car.\n\nGiven that a family member has pulmonary concerns, I think you should be extra vigilant. The smoke from wood-burning fires is particularly hazardous if not contained. It may seem natural and nontoxic, but the particulates emitted can get deep into the lungs.\n\nSomething to consider is an exhaust fan at the top of the chimney that mechanically draws the smoke up through the flue. We have used them when we were worried about how well a chimney would draft. Another less expensive option would be to have an air cleaner in the room taking care of any smoke that may escape from the smoke chamber.\n\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

        "content": "ByBeth Treffeisen\nThe beloved Newburyport \u2018Pink House\u2019 will be demolished in the coming weeks after Gov. Maura Healey failed to find an alternative to save the iconic structure.\nLast fall, Gov. Maura Healeystepped into figure out a way to preserve the landmark before it hit the demolition blocks. But, on Friday, Healey announced that a solution with the house\u2019s owners, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, was not met.\n\u201cThough the house will be removed, we remain committed to working together to evaluate additional steps we can take to ensure that the legacy of the Pink House will endure,\u201d Healey said in a statement.\nAdvocacy from State Sen. Bruce Tarr, State Rep. Kristen Kassner, the nonprofit Support The Pink House, and the community has helped bring this topic to the forefront,but to no avail to save itso far.\n\u201cWhile I am both frustrated and disappointed that we couldn\u2019t find a way to save this iconic structure that is important in so many ways, I am deeply appreciative to everyone who worked tirelessly to achieve the common goal of preserving this structure,\u201d said Sen.

The site will replace the former WLVI TV station commercial building with two residential buildings and an adjoining community park.\nBoston-based commercial and residential developer Copper Mill and POB Capital, a Chicago-based commercial real estate investment management firm, are proposing the new mixed-use development near the JFK/Umass MBTA stop.\nThe project includes two buildings, one 204 feet high and the other 206 feet high, totaling about 650,000 square feet of mixed-use space. It will consist of 750 residential units, ground-floor retail, below-grade parking, and outdoor green space.\nThe project is the first phase of the Planned Development Area, which the BPDA approved in December 2023.\n\u201c(Copper Mill) is committed to delivering a mixed-use program that serves the long-term interests of the Savin Hill, Columbia Point and greater Dorchester neighborhoods,\u201d wrote CEO Andrew Flynn in aletterto the city.\nThe developers say that after speaking with community members, they identified transit-oriented housing and the redevelopment of the decommissioned radio station building on the property as the most significant needs in the neighborhood.\nThe site is north of the formerBoston Globeheadquarters \u2014 now called Southline, a lab and office space \u2014 east of I-93, and south of two residential buildings.\nAbout 150 units, or 20% of the housing proposed for the site, is slated to be affordable.\nAccording to theproject notificationfiled with the city, the proposed site at 75 Morrissey Blvd. has a long-vacant single-story commercial building from the 1950s.\nThe redevelopment area in the master plan also includes 35-45 Morrissey Blvd., which houses a one-story Star Market and liquor store, and 55 Morrissey Blvd., a two-story building that was previously occupied for decades by various radio and TV broadcasters but was vacated in 2022 and replaced with a short-term license forThe Record Company.\nThe master plan includes turning the 8.9-acre property into a mixed-use neighborhood with seven new commercial and residential buildings.

        "content": "ByMegan Johnson\nLess than a year after formerPatsplayer Matthew Judon was traded to the Atlanta Falcons, the linebacker has listed his palatial Dedham home for $2.898 million.\nThe five-bed, seven-bath (five full, two half) home at 7 Schoolmaster Lane, which measures 9,967 square feet (including the finished lower level), is set on 1.63 acres. It was built in 2001.\nPerched at the beginning of the street behind a fieldstone wall overlooking the Dedham Country & Polo Club, a short flight of steps up to the front door brings guests into the stunning two-story foyer under a sparkling chandelier. Boasting an open floor plan, it features hardwood floors and custom woodwork running throughout the dramatic space. To the right, you\u2019ll find the 415-square-foot formal living room that\u2019s helmed by a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace under a coffered ceiling. To the left is a 201-square-foot office featuring a vaulted ceiling, extensive built-ins, and two windows overlooking the front yard.\n\u201cWhen you enter, it has a great wow effect,\u201d saidJeff Groperof the Jeff Groper Group, who shares thelistingwith Courtney Gonsalves. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a masterpiece.\u201d\nBack in the foyer, four stairs take you to the entertainment area. A formal dining room is the ideal spot to entertain guests under a tray-style ceiling. A large, open kitchen measuring 295 square feet is helmed by a center island featuring quartz countertops with beveled edges. Top-of-the-line Thermador and Sub-Zero stainless steel appliances complement the quartz on the backsplashes. The kitchen seamlessly flows into the great room, which is the perfect spot for relaxing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way people love to live now, with that wide open floor plan,\u201d Groper said. \u201cYou can be in the kitchen but still be involved with what\u2019s going on in the family room.\u201d\nFrench doors lead out to the backyard, which is completely fenced in. A stone patio is great for the warmer months.\nBack inside, the stairs lead up to the second floor, which is home to four of the bedrooms. Each bedroom is en-suite, including the stunning 414-square-foot primary bedroom, which features dual 81-square-foot walk-in closets and a cozy fireplace. The primary suite\u2019s bathroom, a 239-square-foot oasis,\u00a0 is particularly stunning and features extensive amounts of quartz throughout. There\u2019s also a soaking tub, multi-head shower, double sinks, and a private toilet area. The floor is also heated.\nHead downstairs to the finished lower level, which features comfortable hangout spaces like a rec room, wet bar, and an entertainment/media area. The lower level is also home to the fifth bedroom, which measures 188 square feet, and a bathroom.\u00a0The home also has a three-car garage that measures over 771 square feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in wonderful condition, and it\u2019s just a great layout,\u201d said Groper, who notes how close the home is to nearby highways.\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\n\n\u00a92025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

But on the 35th floor of the Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center, life felt as easy as a summer afternoon, and Richard Baumert was marveling at the lap pool: 75 feet long, surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, its water a bewitching shade of . . . let’s call it concierge blue.“You’re doing laps in the sky!” exclaimed Baumert, the managing partner of Millennium Partners. He sounded as awed as a child — and as strategic as a developer positioning his building against rival luxury buildings. “This is a huge draw for people.”Down on earth, where rents have grown punishing and some Bostonians are being pushed from their homes, affordable housing has become a central issue in the mayoral campaign.AdvertisementBut in the sky — the city’s new status neighborhood — the fight is not over meeting the basic needs of life, but over lifestyle. It’s a war of amenities. On beast mode.Club VIP is a pet day care and wellness spa in The Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeIn a world where two-bedroom condos routinely go for $2 million plus, monthly homeowners associations costs can run you $2,000 or more, and penthouses sell for tens of millions of dollars, buildings are no longer just buildings. In the words of Ricardo Rodriguez, a Coldwell Banker luxury real estate agent, they’re “vertical country clubs.”There are resident-only restaurants run by fancy chefs. Golf simulators that come with a wet bar. Children’s playrooms that are so perfectly staged no children should be allowed. Decks landscaped to evoke the Mediterranean, screening rooms for private movie nights, IV drips, “Succession”-worthy work spaces, fitness centers with locker rooms more lavish than many homes. Places just for stretching. Service so gracious it spoils you for interactions with members of your own family.The golf simulation room is part of The Collective business club in The Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeAt The Four Seasons One Dalton, not only is the driveway covered, the sidewalks are heated. EchelonSeaport has three pools, one with a waterfall and cabanas; and a basketball court that converts into a pickleball court. At Raffles Boston Residences, there are butlers and perhaps something even better — a framing for your life that sounds like it was written by Don Draper himself.Advertisement“Home,” the website reads. “It is here that we return time and again, after all our voyages of discovery. It is the beginning and end of every journey, a feeling we carry in our hearts, a memory that calls us back.”The basketball court and gym at Echelon Seaport.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeBut perhaps most important — and competitive of all — are amenities for the dogs.At The Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center in the Financial District, canine services include aromatherapy facials, ($50), agility training ($300 for six sessions), and luxury boarding at a New Hampshire farm ($105 a night).During a recent tour of the dog spa, Baumert said the building also offers canine acupuncture ($65) and Reiki. As he spoke, Lila, a long-haired Dachshund, looked on, perhaps eager to have her chakras read (for $50), or maybe saddened that she doesn’t live at The Sudbury in Bulfinch Crossing.The Raffles hotel in the Back Bay at 40 Trinity Place, Boston.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThere, in addition to glorious outdoor spaces for humans — including a pool and an open-air ninth-floor “front porch” with rocking chairs — there’s outside space for dogs, too. To run, and also to relieve themselves.“Some buildings make them go indoors,” said Simona LaPosta, a real estate agent with Advisors Living, who was showing a reporter around. She allowed herself a quick wince, perhaps at the thought of the odor or maybe to drive home a selling point.Many of the city’s luxury towers have been built in areas that lack the charm of Back Bay or Beacon Hill, but who cares! There’s no need to ever leave (except to fly to your other homes).Club VIP is a pet day care and wellness spa in The Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeAs David Bates, a real estate agent with William Raveis, wrote in his lively newsletter: “Bostonians once flaunted their social position by living in historic buildings with premier addresses. Today, however, the city’s wealthiest residents can flex their status by owning high-floor residences in Boston’s new residential skyscrapers.”AdvertisementIndeed, the city’s newest luxury tower, the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Boston, South Station Tower, is over a train station.But no matter. “Life Above the Clouds” is how the location is positioned on the website. “Beginning at an elevation of more than 450 feet” the residences “comprise a collection of extraordinary private homes and amenities in the sky.”The kitchen, dining, and living area at the Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIf we were in New York City, nicknaming convention would practically demand we call this new neighborhood “BoSky.”Just a generation ago, Boston was a town where even doormen weren’t that common. But in the summer of 2000, the game changed, according to a 2023 Globe Spotlight report on Boston’s housing crisis and the luxury tower building boom. That’s when the Trinity Place condo building opened in Copley Square, with a then-astonishing claim: that life there would bring a “Total Fulfillment of Needs.” Since then, more than 50 sizable developments featuring multimillion-dollar condos — both new construction and renovations — have opened in Boston.And by now, woe to the building that doesn’t offer at least a dog-washing station, indoors though it may be.The game room in The Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeIn late February, Bates, the real estate agent, did a keyword search for amenities in the 763 condos on the Boston market. The goal was to see what’s become a must-have — even in nonluxury buildings.“Concierge,” he said, reading out a keyword. “There are 224, even some in East Boston. One hundred and forty-one [listings] have a pool. Decks, that’s 268. Valet, there are 95. Forty-nine have some kind of sports simulator.”AdvertisementA few years ago, with amenity madness blooming, the term “fully amenitized” entered the lexicon (with coinage claimed by power broker Maggie Gold Seelig) and now it’s even arrived in Beacon Hill.The library lounge at Echelon Seaport.Brett Phelps for The Boston Globe“The Archer Residences joined two historically significant buildings to create the first fully amenitized, full-service luxury condominium in Beacon Hill,” reads the website for the seven-story project on Temple Street.Alas, even in BoSky, sometimes there must be a nod to reality. As the website for Ritz-Carlton Residences over South Station tries to boast, the location provides “. . . immediate vehicular access to I-90, I-93 and the Ted Williams Tunnel.”There’s one nightmare no amount of amenitization can buy you out of: Boston drivers.Choose a lane, buddy!The lounge in The Millennium Residences at Winthrop Center.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeBeth Teitell can be reached at beth.teitell@globe.com.

       "  'content': 'The agency managing federal real estate sparked quite a kerfuffle on Tuesday when it published a list of more than 400 buildings across the country and in Puerto Rico that it deemed “non core” to government operations and thus ripe with redevelopment potential.The General Services Administration said many of the 443 properties — including the newly built $530 million Volpe Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge that replaced a 1970s-era office — were “functionally obsolete.”Related: Trump administration lists federal buildings in Mass., nationwide, that it might put up for sale.But other properties on the list are not as up to date, such as the John F.

The administration said it would consider selling the 443 properties or pursue other deals — public-private partnerships, ground leases, sale-leasebacks — along with possible co-working agreements between government agencies.AdvertisementBy Wednesday, however, the full “non-core property list” was no longer available on the GSA website. Instead, the list is advertised as “coming soon.” The Boston Globe saved a copy; check out the full list below.There are 20 properties in New England on the list — two in Connecticut, four in Maine, nine in Massachusetts, one in New Hampshire and four in Vermont. (Rhode Island’s federal buildings were not included.)In a Wednesday statement, the GSA said it received “an overwhelming amount of interest” and that it anticipated republishing the list “in the near future after we evaluate this initial input.”“Just because an asset is on the list doesn’t mean it’s immediately available for sale,” the GSA’s Wednesday statement said.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

       "  'subhead': 'The mayor’s enthusiasm for the White Stadium project stands in sharp contrast to seven years ago, when she blocked a plan for a New England Revolution stadium as a city councilor',\n",
       "  'content': 'It wasn’t that long ago that one of the most powerful members of the Boston City Council raised all sorts of questions about whether the city was moving too quickly to sell city land to a private developer for a professional soccer stadium.The councilor? Michelle Wu, who in 2018 stood in the way of then-Mayor Marty Walsh’s plan to help Robert Kraft build a soccer stadium for his New England Revolution. Walsh wanted to issue a request for proposals, or an RFP, to sell an 18-acre city-owned tow lot in South Boston off the Southeast Expressway, as a way to give Kraft an opportunity at a site for a long-planned Revs stadium.But Walsh had to get his plan past Wu, who at the time chaired a council committee that had to declare the lot surplus property before it could be sold. And she wasn’t going to just greenlight it.“Rather than just take a vote and move on, we should hear more from the public and gather more [information],” Wu told the Globe at the time. “Public land should be used for the greatest public good. We haven’t seen any analysis yet of what the greatest good would be.”AdvertisementMy my, how the tables have turned.The lot never went up for sale — it’s still where you go when your car gets towed from downtown — and Kraft moved on, setting his sights on building a stadium in Everett. But the more things change, the more they stay the same.Wu’s now the mayor, trying to help a new professional women’s soccer team turn White Stadium in Franklin Park into a gleaming new home. And now she, too, is getting in hot water over the city’s RFP process.The White Stadium arrangement is different than the tow lot in that Wu is not selling the 10,000-seat facility to a private developer, but rather leasing it to Boston Unity Soccer Partners for 10 years. Under the deal, the city would continue to own the stadium, and the team would share it with Boston Public Schools. The city and team will split the cost of the renovation, which is expected to exceed $200 million.AdvertisementThe city tow lot south of downtown was once seen as a potential site for a stadium for the New England Revolution. But then-City Councilor Michelle Wu blocked a deal.David L. RyanWhite Stadium has been crumbling for decades, and many a mayor has tried to renovate it. The Wu administration contends that having a private partner is the only way the city can afford to fix it, and the deal struck with the team still gives the community and BPS full-day access to the stadium for all but 40 days of the year.But much as Wu did seven years ago, critics say the White Stadium plan is opaque, misguided, and being rammed through. The city, they say, needs to do more research on how best to renovate the stadium for BPS.This week we learned, as first reported in the Boston Herald, that Wu’s City Hall has been in talks with Boston Unity Soccer Partners about White Stadium as early as September 2022. With the seed planted, the city issued an RFP in April 2023 for a lease of White Stadium in a “public-private partnership.”We can all guess what happened next: The RFP went out, and Boston Unity Soccer Partners was the only group that submitted a proposal.Opponents of the White Stadium plan — some neighbors and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy — have seized on the Herald story, based on email exchanges between the team and city officials, as proof the team had an inside track on the stadium.Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft had choice words, too, calling the report evidence of a “secretive and rigged RFP process.”Wu has vigorously disputed that characterization, calling it “inaccurate.” Indeed, there’s nothing untoward about potential bidders having conversations with the city before an RFP is filed, and it’s conceivable that the RFP generated only a single response.Advertisement(Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has had a minority interest in the women’s soccer team, and last week she announced she is pulling out of the team’s investor group.)As for what happened in 2018, Wu got on the phone on Thursday to say that she has been “completely consistent” on how there should be public discussions about how to use public land. She said the Walsh administration’s proposal to sell the tow lot for a soccer stadium never went anywhere because no one was willing to publicly offer details at a hearing Wu chaired at the time.“I was never opposed to a soccer stadium in Boston,” she said. “I’ve always felt that we should try to bring that amenity and economic development opportunity and excitement to the city.”Wu went on to say that after becoming mayor she reached out to Robert Kraft about having the Revs stadium in Boston. She said she never heard back. (On Friday, a spokesperson for Robert Kraft said he never heard from the Wu administration.)The White Stadium deal reflects how she feels that public land should not be sold off, similar to how she felt as a councilor in 2018, and how public land as a general principle “should stay wherever possible, under the public trust, under public ownership, because that is how you have permanent control over what happens.”Still, that hasn’t placated opponents who have sued the city to halt the project, with the case set to go to trial on March 18. Demolition is well underway, and Wu said the construction schedule is on track. The women’s team is planning to play in the renovated White Stadium by its inaugural season next spring.AdvertisementMeantime, it’s a mayoral election year. Stadium opponents and supporters are worked up. And just as you thought the L’Affaire White Stadium couldn’t get any messier — it has.So, for Wu, perhaps we’ll file this one under: Do as I say, not as I do.Shirley Leung is a Business columnist.

       "  'hed': 'Middleborough sues Healey, state over MBTA housing law requirements',\n",
       "  'subhead': '',\n",
       "  'content': \"The town of Middleborough sued Governor Maura Healey and the state housing office Friday, seeking an exemption from the controversial MBTA Communities Act, which requires cities and towns served by the T to make it easier to build multifamily housing within their borders.The lawsuit asks for a waiver from the law’s zoning requirements under a recent opinion from State Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who called the law an “unfunded mandate” because, she said, the Legislature did not designate adequate funds for its implementation.Related: More controversy erupts after state auditor says Mass. housing law is an ‘unfunded mandate’Middleborough, the town said in the lawsuit, has already built housing near its commuter rail station in recent years, and should not be forced to make room for more. Adhering to the law’s requirements would be a “significant expense” because the town does not have the infrastructure to accommodate more development, it said. Lawyers for the town added that the state has gone too far in punishing towns it deems noncompliant, carrying out a “campaign of threats, intimidation, and coercion.”Middleborough, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles south of Boston, has been at odds with the state over MBTA Communities for years. Its Select Board in 2022 voted to ignore the law’s requirements, making it the first town to take an official stand against the law. Last year, Town Meeting there overwhelmingly voted down a plan to comply, and the Select Board again decided this year against submitting an action plan for compliance under an extended state deadline.AdvertisementThe town wrote to DiZoglio’s office last year requesting her to weigh in on the law, and when Middleborough officials received her opinion last week calling it an unfunded mandate, they moved quickly to prepare a lawsuit.For the Healey administration, this is yet another roadblock for a law that it inherited from the Legislature but has become central to its housing strategy.The administration set a goal in February of building 222,000 new homes by 2035 in order to head off the housing shortage, which is quickly warping the economic reality of everyday residents. The state is well behind the pace of construction needed to meet that goal, and officials see MBTA Communities — Massachusetts’ most consequential new housing law in decades — as key to course correcting. Most of the state’s housing production over the last several decades has happened in Boston and a few neighboring communities. The law is designed to stimulate housing production in the suburbs and towns in Eastern Massachusetts that have long shut out new development.Related: 222,000 new homes must be built over the next decade to fix housing shortage, state saysAdvertisementBut towns have not taken kindly to the law. Some see it as an affront on Massachusetts' tradition of local government decisions over land-use rules, and many do not want to encourage the production of more homes, particularly apartment buildings.The law requires 177 cities and towns with access to the T create zoning districts that allow for multifamily housing, but it does not mandate building.Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued the town of Milton last year for failing to meet the law’s requirements, and the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law, though it also ruled that the state must put the guidelines that shape its implementation through a formal regulatory process.Campbell, in a statement Friday, said her office will defend the law.“I am grateful to the majority of communities that understand the importance of responsible zoning, and my office and I intend to successfully defend this law in court,” Campbell said. “It is regrettable that the Auditor’s incorrect legal assessment has spurred challenges to a law meant to address our housing crisis.”Middleborough officials say the town created a multifamily zoning district in 2021 that has since yielded 174 multifamily units, a quarter of which are set at affordable rents. And over the last 20 years, the town has seen 881 housing units built within a mile of its commuter rail station.Related: How will the state’s historic rezoning mandate affect your community?AdvertisementIt argues that should be enough to satisfy the requirements of MBTA Communities. But under the law, the town has to create zoning that makes room for at least 1,471 units. The zoning the town passed in 2021 only allows for 549 units.Lawyers for the town said it has been unfairly punished for not complying with the law’s requirements “through the withholding and/or recission of more than $6.5 million in funding for school programs, infrastructure projects, and other initiatives that are necessary to provide the very housing the Act was enacted to create.” Those funding programs are discretionary, and the state has, in some cases, tied towns’ chances of approval to their MBTA Communities compliance status.“This isn’t something new in Middleboro. We recognize the need for more housing near public transit as a function of responsible town planning,” Middleborough Town Manager James McGrail said Friday. “We’ve done our part. We are not anti-housing. The fact that we’re even having to go to court to sort this out is crazy.”Andrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'A team of Boston developers and Chicago investors have unveiled their designs for a pair of 18-story apartment towers on the site of the former WLVI television studio in Dorchester, the first phase of an already approved project that would bring five other buildings to that stretch of Morrissey Boulevard.Local development firm Copper Mill and an entity managed by Chicago-based investor POB Capital are proposing two towers with a combined 754 apartments near the JFK/UMass MBTA stop, next to the former headquarters of The Boston Globe, now a lab and office complex called Southline.The development team “is committed to delivering a mixed-use program that serves the long-term interests of Savin Hill, Columbia Point and greater Dorchester neighborhoods,” wrote Andrew Flynn, Copper Mill’s founder and chief executive, in a December letter to the Boston Planning Department.AdvertisementA rendering of two 18-story residential towers proposed at 75 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester.CBTDesigned by Boston-based CBT Architects, the towers — one at 204 feet facing Morrissey Boulevard, another at 206 feet facing Interstate 93 — would each have three levels of underground parking. Between them, the developers have planned a roughly half-acre community park.The Morrissey Boulevard project stretches nearly 9 acres from 35-75 Morrissey Blvd., including the Star Market grocery store and former TV studio along with the former Beasley Media radio studios. A seven-building master plan, approved by the Boston Planning and Development Agency board in 2023 — albeit under a different developer — calls for three apartment buildings and four office/lab buildings.The BPDA board-approved master plan calls for a grocery store to be included within the third planned residential tower. The radio site at 55 Morrissey Blvd. now houses The Record Co., which offers affordable recording studio and rehearsal spaces. Beasley relocated to Waltham last year, and The Record Co. has said it intends to stay in 55 Morrissey through January 2027.The development would include a community park between the two new residential towers.CBTOf the 754 apartments planned at 75 Morrissey Blvd., about 150 — or 20 percent — would be set aside as affordable. Copper Mill said it intends to start construction in the first half of next year, wrapping up by early 2029.The site is located across Morrissey Boulevard from the mammoth 21-building Dorchester Bay City mixed-use project. The BPDA board approved the master plan for that 36-acre project in fall 2023.AdvertisementCopper Mill is also proposing a 25-story apartment tower on Elm Street in Somerville, a project that earlier this year prompted dueling flyer wars. Flynn was formerly the top local executive of London-based private student housing developer Scape, which in 2019 explored building a 250-unit apartment tower and two years later proposed lab space at the Davis Square site.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

       "  'subhead': 'There’s one hitch: The site has a legacy of industrial contamination',\n",
       "  'content': 'Massachusetts state officials have offered up a prime location in Woburn for development: the 26-acre Anderson Regional Transportation Center.The transportation hub, at 100 Atlantic Ave., is owned by a joint venture of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and is home to a station for the MBTA’s Lowell commuter rail line, Amtrak’s Downeaster line, and Massport’s Logan Express shuttles. Any development would need to retain or enhance the various transit uses. However, because of a history of pollution there, residential and school uses are currently not allowed.The goal is to find a developer willing to take some or all of the 2,400 surface parking spaces and consolidate them in a multi-level garage, opening up land for development. For now, the transit agencies are seeking “expressions of interest” from developers to better understand the site’s potential and the market demand. Responses are due by April 30.Other development activities nearby include the rezoning of 53 acres east of the rail line, to allow for multifamily construction in compliance with the MBTA Communities Act, the start of construction of a 425-unit multifamily project northwest of the transit hub, and permits issued for a 250-unit multifamily project north of the hub and a mixed-use project just to the west of it.AdvertisementOne of the biggest challenges, though, will be dealing with the property’s contamination and its legacy as a Superfund site (a federal designation that identifies highly polluted properties). Industrial operations at the property, part of what was once known as the Industri-Plex site, contaminated the nearby Aberjona River as well as adjacent wetlands and the Mystic Lakes over the course of more than a century, through the 1960s. The transit agencies, in developing the Anderson center more than 20 years ago, built 25 acres of parking and a subsurface “geotextile” barrier to help contain the underground pollution.For a developer to proceed with residential construction, the transit agencies said, it would need to work with federal and state environmental regulators to reevaluate the residential restriction.The transit hub is named after Jimmy Anderson, a child who died at the age of 12 from leukemia and whose case was made famous in the book and the movie, “A Civil Action,” about groundwater pollution in Woburn.AdvertisementJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

       "  'content': 'Michael Montanino grew up in East Boston, around the corner from Santarpio’s, a foster kid in a house with nine other children. He dealt with learning disabilities and lingering effects of malnutrition from his earliest years, then went on to run track in high school and graduate from North Shore Community College.Montanino struggled with alcoholism in his college years — a problem that led him to living on the streets for nearly two years. He’d bounce back and forth from the Constitution Beach Walk to Jeffries Point, to the library and the flower shop. Sometimes he did food app delivery on foot for $7 an order.“That was my homeless life, just going from one thing to another ... never really knowing where my next meal was coming from,” he said.AdvertisementThese days, though, Montanino is calling Jamaica Plain home. He’s one of the new residents at 3368 Washington St., a five-story, $105 million residential building celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. Developed by Boston-based The Community Builders and homeless services provider Pine Street Inn, the building — to be named “The Lyndia” in honor of Pine Street Inn executive director Lyndia Downie — is the largest permanent supportive housing development in New England. The 202-unit building includes 140 studios for formerly unhoused people referred by Pine Street in one wing, and 62 affordable units for families in another.The city of Boston provided some $17.3 million to the project, and supported it amid a lengthy lawsuit that challenged its zoning.Related: ‘Permanent supportive housing’ may be controversial to would-be neighbors, but it’s been beneficial to those who live in it | Shirley Leung“To solve homelessness, you have to tackle the roots of the problem, which is making sure that people can have a home, and have support in living in their homes,” said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. “You really have to have a plan for homes to be accessible and supportive for everyone.”Downie has long championed permanent supportive housing, which is basically an apartment with social services on site, and Pine Street has gradually grown its inventory of such buildings in recent years. Advocates say tackling the roots of homelessness requires more than just handing out grants, and instead making sure individuals have both a roof over their heads and access to health and wellness support systems to guide them through a world-upending transition. Montanino said he is frequently connected with security and outreach personnel, case managers, a personal landlord, and property managers, all of whom helped him move — and stay — off the streets.Advertisement“They’re all hands on deck here,” he said.Michael Montanino in his new unit at 3368 Washington St.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe 3368 Washington project includes support services like onsite mental health counseling, 24/7 security, and key fob-activated elevators. Residents are directly referred by Pine Street Inn. On a recent tour of the building, fliers for workforce development programs with Pine Street and Roxbury Community College were available for anyone to read.The property was formerly a low-slung warehouse, which Pine Street bought in 1997 and over the years used for a variety of functions, including office space for case workers and a small woodworking program. As Pine Street ramped up its housing development efforts, the site stood out, particularly given its proximity to the Green Street Orange Line station. Most developers responded to Pine Street’s bid for proposals with pitches for around 40 to 60 units, Downie said. But Bart Mitchell, CEO of The Community Builders, aimed higher.“Bart and I went over to look at the site, and Bart, even that day, said, ‘Look, if we can get some height relief, we can do something really sustainable here. We can get some scale,’” Downie said. “That was what, for us, was so exciting. ... The more long-term people you can move out, the better chance you have of meeting shelter demand.”The project hasn’t been without its challenges. The landlord of a neighboring property sued in 2020, alleging the zoning process to allow the project was flawed. Though the lawsuit eventually settled, the delay cost “multiple millions” of dollars, said Andy Waxman, Community Builders’ senior vice president of real estate.AdvertisementPine Street and The Community Builders are collaborating on similar projects, including 900 Morrissey Blvd. in Dorchester, which is under construction now. While many community groups in Jamaica Plain, including the Egleston Square Neighborhood Association and the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council, supported 3368 Washington, other projects across the city have seen fierce pushback from neighborhoods.The exterior of 3368 Washington St. in Jamaica Plain. The 202-unit project will include 140 units designated for supportive housing for individuals referred by Pine Street and 62 units for families.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff“It’s an unknown for a lot of people, so I think it creates more anxiety for people — in an understandable way — not knowing exactly what it is,” Waxman said. “Permanent housing with the level of support that Pine Street Inn provides — that combination is great. And so it takes people some time to learn that.”Potential residents apply through the Boston Housing Authority, and then are screened by Pine Street. Folks have moved in gradually over the past few months, Downie said, and the building is expected to be full by June.With a gentle demeanor and a quick smile, Montanino proudly showed off his new home last week. He’s learning to cook, and there are spices and oil next to his stove — he’s done steaks and chicken, burgers, and salads. He’s volunteering, and has lined up a job — he starts in April. He dreams of adopting a child, as his mother did him.“My life’s back,” Montanino said. “I get up early in the morning. I count my blessings, for sure.”Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com. Follow her @bycathcarlock.',\n",

       "  'content': \"When Fortis Property Group announced a $1 billion refinancing of One Lincoln St. in 2022, the developers championed the deal as a milestone for downtown Boston’s revitalization.Fortis had landed a deal to lease 11 floors of the 36-story office building to private equity company HarbourVest and promised a heap of amenities — rooftop tennis and basketball courts, an artisanal market, and biergarten — to draw more tenants to fill the rest of the half-empty tower. Those plans attracted sophisticated investors, including San Francisco-based DivcoWest and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, according to a real estate industry source with knowledge of the deal.“This is an important moment for our firm and all of our partners,” said Joel Kestenbaum, president of Brooklyn-based Fortis, at the time. “And we couldn’t be prouder to see this deal come to fruition after nearly a year in the making.”Next week, the 503-foot tower will go up for auction — a move forced by one of Fortis’s unpaid lenders.AdvertisementIt’s a stunning turn of events for a building whose blue glass and gray granite facade has long been one of the most prominent points on Boston’s skyline. For two decades, it was home to State Street Corp., until 2023, when the financial giant decamped for a new tower across town.One Lincoln never recovered, and today — despite HarbourVest’s arrival — the building still stands about half empty. There are at least four big loans on the tower, and with little rent coming in, Fortis has struggled to pay down its substantial debt. Now lenders want the money back. In the auction process, a new owner will likely take over the building.The facade at One Lincoln St.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFortis did not respond to a request for comment.While it’s not clear how much One Lincoln will fetch at auction, it’s fair to expect a far lower sum than the $1 billion valuation it commanded in 2022. That’s a reality facing many commercial real estate owners in Boston right now. Five years after COVID upended the city’s office market, a long-delayed reckoning on the value of office towers is coming, with major implications on the city’s tax base and the future of downtown.Advertisement“It’s like the stock market — it’s not a loss until you sell it,” said Dion Sorrentino, associate director of market analytics at CoStar Group in Boston. “They’re going to hold it for as long as they can.”For a dozen years after the 2008 financial crisis, commercial real estate prices steadily rose in Boston, generating eye-popping sales numbers and fueling the city’s budget. Rock-bottom interest rates made borrowing easy and cheap. Companies poured into downtown to tap the city’s talented young workforce. By the end of 2019, office vacancy was in the single digits and investors spent more than $8 billion that year alone to snap up commercial real estate that, by all accounts, was going to remain valuable for years to come.Then came the pandemic. Demand for office space plummeted, and today the vacancy rate is 21.1 percent, according to real estate firm Newmark. Meanwhile interest rates skyrocketed. That made it more expensive to borrow money for development projects and to refinance existing debt, particularly loans made at low, pre-COVID, interest rates.A developer has proposed converting 400 Atlantic Ave., a low-lying brick office facing Boston Harbor, into a hotel.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffDowntown landlords could hang on, for a time.While there are abundant smaller owners, many premier buildings in Boston are owned — in full or in part — by large real estate firms such as Boston Properties and Tishman Speyer; private equity like Rockpoint Group; or investment arms of pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, such as Oxford Properties and Norges Bank. Their deep pockets bought them time, and lenders offered extensions on repayments for a year or two, said Mark Fallon, director of research and strategy at real estate brokerage Hunneman in Boston.AdvertisementFor years, that “extend and pretend” phenomenon kept Boston’s commercial real estate sales market in relative stasis. Meanwhile owners fished for lucrative new leases to pay down their debt. The prospect of converting office to lab space — expensive, but with the potential to draw in high-paying life-science companies as tenants — continued to generate hope for a turnaround.But mostly, local owners have held off on selling for a simple reason, said Jeffrey Havsy of Moody’s Analytics.“They didn’t have to,” he said. “There was no forcing mechanism, if the debt wasn’t due.”Now though, those bills are coming due, prompting new momentum in the sales market. For many, the decision to sell will be difficult and costly: Havsy said many downtown buildings could sell for 40 to 60 percent of their pre-COVID price.The trend is one that city officials and financial watchdogs are monitoring closely. Some 71.1 percent of Boston’s $4.6 billion budget is funded by property taxes — much of it on commercial property — and price declines could hit that revenue hard. But the change could also lower rents, potentially broadening the number of tenants who can afford space downtown.Related: Corporate signs are proliferating on Boston's skylineA price reset, Havsy said, can also loosen up opportunities for investors with cash and patience, like Norges Bank. In December, an arm of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund paid $248 per square foot for just over half of 33 Arch St., according to research from real estate firm Avison Young. That’s less than half the $606 per square foot that retirement behemoth TIAA paid to buy the 33-story downtown tower in 2011. (Norges bought out the first half of TIAA’s stake in 2013.)Advertisement“In a period of heightened dislocation in the office sector, we see this as an opportune moment to invest,” said Norges real estate executive Per Løken in a statement. Along with offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Norges also bought just over half of 501 Boylston St. in Back Bay — noting its $194.9 million in existing debt — giving it full control of the building after it bought the first half in 2018.TIAA did not respond to a Globe request for comment.That kind of real estate calculus — or perhaps musical chairs — can get tricky fast, leaving a fair amount of uncertainty as to what buildings are actually worth. In the past five years, it’s been tough to discern the pandemic’s impact on office values, and, in turn, municipal tax revenues — in large part because many owners haven’t had to sell.“What is happening now is a reset,” said Jason S. Weissman, founder of Boston Realty Advisors. “And we’re seeing it all over.”Many of the city’s largest taxpayers are commercial landlords. One Lincoln, the tower up for auction in March, owes more than $15 million in net tax to the city this fiscal year. The 32-story office tower at 99 High St., which went up for sale in July, owes $8.6 million in net taxes. The value of those buildings has an outsize impact on city finances, one reason Mayor Michelle Wu last year sought to hike commercial tax rates to keep revenue flowing. That effort stalled in the state Senate, but she is trying again this year.The 32-story office tower at 99 High St. was listed for sale in July 2024.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffIndeed, a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in downtown property values could represent a mammoth hit to city finances. The Boston Municipal Research Bureau, an independent financial watchdog organization, in November explored how the city could diversify its revenue sources to not be so heavily dependent on property taxes.AdvertisementOf course, not all buildings are selling for a loss. An entity of Qatari investor Ezdan Holding Group paid $99.5 million for the 11-story office at 855 Boylston St. in Back Bay in fall 2023 — more than double what the property sold for in 2000. And, generally speaking, newer and higher-end buildings have maintained stronger demand from tenants willing to pay top-tier rents.But for buildings with low occupancy, it’s difficult to restructure debt, said Aaron Jodka, the director of US capital markets research for Colliers. That’s opening up avenues for buyers — family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other private investors — who are seeing “a generational acquisition opportunity,” Jodka said, and sometimes a chance to try something other than office space.One example: JAJ Investment Group, the Luxembourg-based family office of French financier Jacques Chahine, plans to convert 400 Atlantic Ave. — a low-lying former law office facing Boston Harbor — into a hotel. The office was formerly the longtime home of Goulston & Storrs, which moved to nearby One Post Office Square last April.“When there is upheaval and change in the market, it does create new opportunities for others,” Jodka said. “Unfortunately, there’s usually the pain the previous owner has to go through.”Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

       "  'subhead': 'The proposal by Mayor Michelle Wu’s challenger is not really rent control in the traditional sense, housing experts and political observers say. Regardless, his embrace of the term appears to be a calculated move.',\n",
       "  'content': \"On the day he launched his mayoral campaign, Josh Kraft went on the offensive, assailing Mayor Michelle Wu over her record on bike lanes and housing construction. That was no surprise.But one avenue of attack raised eyebrows across the city. Kraft said he would make good on a progressive policy promise that Wu had tried but failed: Bringing rent control back to Boston.“Mayor Wu promised us rent control three years ago,” Kraft said. “We will deliver it finally.”That Kraft, the son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft and a favored candidate in some corners of the business community, would lean into an issue that many economists believe does more harm than good and most landlords despise, signals just how big a problem the cost of housing has become for everyday Bostonians. Yet the specifics of his proposal suggest he’s trying to walk a fine political line to appeal to two very different political constituencies that rarely see eye to eye: the business community and tenants.While Kraft calls his proposal rent control, housing experts and political observers said it is not really rent control in the traditional sense of the hard rent caps seen in New York City, San Francisco, and Boston before state voters outlawed them here in 1994. It is instead an optional program for landlords who would receive tax breaks if they agree to cap annual rent increases. While it could be appealing for property owners to participate, it is not mandatory. And critics argue Kraft’s plan may simply provide some landlords with tax breaks, while doing little to protect struggling renters.Related: Josh Kraft’s tax break for ‘good landlords’ already exists, and the Boston City Council just voted for itAdvertisementBut his embrace of a term once considered politically untenable appears to be a calculated move. The idea of rent control has become increasingly popular in some corners of the city as rents climb relentlessly upward. And these days, political observers say, winning an election in Boston requires a whatever-it-takes approach to housing affordability.“[Kraft’s proposal] is not rent control, but the fact that he’s proposing it shows how significant an issue housing has become for the city,” said Josh Zakim, a former city councilor who served alongside Wu and who now runs a housing advocacy group. “It’s the biggest issue facing the city and the Commonwealth, and I don’t think you can run a serious campaign for public office here without a plan to address it.”AdvertisementKraft’s plan takes considerable cues from the version of rent control that Wu tried unsuccessfully to push through the state Legislature in 2023. Like Wu’s plan, it would tie allowable rent hikes to inflation, with a hard cap of 10 percent per year. While Wu’s set no income guidelines, Kraft’s plan would be open to tenants who make less than 200 percent of the Area Median Income, more than $300,000 for a family of four, which he said would prevent luxury buildings from participating.Mayor Michelle Wu looked on as the City Council voted to approve her proposal to restore rent control in Boston in 2023. The measure later died on Beacon Hill.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe StaffThe biggest differences are that Kraft’s program would be optional for landlords, and would come with a sweetener: property tax breaks of 20 percent for participating buildings. Kraft said he’d pay for that with tax revenue generated by new residential construction, which he hopes to spark by lowering affordable housing requirements.The city requires 20 percent of units in new developments to be set aside at affordable rents. Kraft wants to lower it to 13 percent, the rule that was in place before Wu took office.Kraft’s campaign said that because the money would be distributed to landlords in the form of grants, as opposed to formal tax rebates, his plan would not need to go through the state Legislature (though that point is disputed by some advocates and legislators).“Josh’s opt-in rent control plan would provide real relief to renters, unlike Mayor Wu’s failed plan that has helped no one,” the Kraft campaign said in a statement. “This is yet another unfulfilled promise which Mayor Wu needs to explain to voters instead of calling names and making excuses.”Related: Who is Josh Kraft, the nonprofit leader and son of the Patriots owner challenging Michelle Wu for mayor?AdvertisementFor her part, Wu assailed Kraft’s plan, calling it “fake rent control.” She said he is using the promise of rent control to win over struggling renters who are hurting, while offering them no real protections.“This program, a voluntary program, is not going to … protect against the worst offenders [of extreme rent hikes],” Wu said on GBH’s Boston Public Radio last week. “It is a use of resources without offering the types of protections that we really need.”Wu has not reintroduced her rent control plan since it died in the Legislature last year.So far, no prominent tenant groups have come out in support of Kraft’s plan, but it’s getting a positive reception among some real estate interests, who lobbied against Wu’s plan and ultimately helped sink it on Beacon Hill.Developers and landlords generally oppose mandatory rent caps because they limit a building’s profitability, making it more difficult to attract the investors needed to build and therefore slowing new construction. They’re also a political constituency that appears at least intrigued by — if not yet openly supportive of — Kraft’s candidacy.“We have long been opposed to rent control because we have seen the impact it has on housing production,” said Tamara Small, chief executive of real estate trade group NAIOP Massachusetts, which does not endorse political candidates. “When the investors that finance housing development hear the words rent control, they flee. But this proposal is clearly different. I don’t think it would hurt production the way [Wu’s] proposal would.”AdvertisementAn apartment building under construction in Jamaica Plain last year. New construction has slowed in Boston amid higher interest rates and materials costs. Mayoral challenger Josh Kraft has said he'd lower affordable housing requirements to help boost new projects.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe StaffWhile it’s unclear how many landlords may opt in to such a program, some have already indicated they may be interested. In some cases, the program may actually be profitable for landlords, as they’d get tax breaks even in years when they wouldn’t normally raise the rent above the proposed cap.Take Chris Lehman, cofounder of real estate investment group Groma. His group typically raises rent by an average of 3 to 5 percent a year across its more than 300-unit portfolio, well below the cap Kraft proposes. He conducted a financial feasibility analysis of Kraft’s plan at the request of his campaign, and found that savings on taxes would make up for lost rent. He said he would consider enrolling the majority of his units.Related: Lessons in modern-day rent control, 3,000 miles from Boston“If there were an actual rent control, we would of course oppose it,” he said. ”But this program could mean lower rent increases for our residents without hurting development.”What remains to be seen is whether Kraft’s rent moderation policy will be enough to win over housing advocates and tenants who have historically come out in force for Wu and who have often demanded stronger affordability requirements in new development. At least one group of advocates, the Coalition for a Truly Affordable Boston, is more focused on his plan to cut affordability, which they called a “direct attack on Boston’s affordability and housing justice efforts.”“Increasing housing supply alone does not guarantee affordability — especially when developers are not required to build homes that meet the needs of our residents,” said Shameeka Moreno, a member of the Boston Tenant Coalition.AdvertisementAnd lawmakers who’ve long worked on housing issues say they’re skeptical that Kraft’s plan would generate enough affordable units to cancel out the ones lost by lowering affordable housing requirements, or do much to control Boston’s soaring rents at all.“He doesn’t know the meaning of the words he’s using — it’s not rent control,” said State Senator Lydia Edwards, a Wu ally and former city councilor from East Boston. “I welcome creative policy solutions and that this is a major issue in the mayor’s race. But this feels like he’s using the term rent control in order to try to get some attention and some headlines.”Andrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

But through the school’s co-op program, she found herself at a construction meeting detailing renovation plans for the Harvard University Faculty Club. The project superintendent commanded the room, understood all aspects of the job, and was pushing it to the finish line.“I was like: I want that guy’s job,” Slaven said.Related: From 2023: A movement is building to get women into constructionAdvertisementSlaven on Thursday won the mentorship award at the Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts annual Inspire Awards, which honor exemplary women in the construction business.At Shawmut, Slaven started with a three-year rotation program, spending one year learning project management, another learning estimating, and another learning the role of a superintendent. When she started, maybe one-quarter of her rotation’s 20-person cohort were women. The most recent cohort was about half women, she said.Kumba Wahkor (center) rode the hoist/elevator to the sixth floor of 585 Kendall.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffShawmut’s culture is one where teammates push for others to improve and rise up, Slaven said, whether it be giving someone credit or being an unofficial mentor.“Their generosity and inspiration and really what they saw in me that I may not have seen in myself — they really believed in me from the beginning,” Slaven said. “I thought to myself: I need to be paying this forward. Mentorship is a critical role. Because it’s not just about teaching technical skills to somebody else. It’s about inspiring somebody’s confidence, and encouraging their growth.”AdvertisementIronworker Hannah Cahill at 585 Kendall in Cambridge.David L.

       "  'subhead': '',\n",
       "  'content': 'The stately brick homes on Beacon Hill aren’t the only real estate that’s selling for a premium fee.A single parking spot in a garage on Brimmer Street is on the market for $750,000, according to a real estate listing posted last week. It’s just the latest spot to notch a steep price tag in the neighborhood, where it seems the only thing more coveted than housing is parking.“It’s a great long-term hold,” said Rene Rodriguez, a realtor for Cabot & Company and one of the spot’s two listing agents. “They’re not going to be building any more parking on the hill.”The parking space, first reported on by the Boston Herald, is located in a luxury garage just off Storrow Drive that offers refueling, car washing, and other concierge services, according to the listing.AdvertisementRodriguez said the spot belongs to a family that recently closed a deal to sell their home in the neighborhood. Some potential buyers have shown interest in the space, but it was still “very much available” as of Thursday, he added.Brimmer Street Garage, which bills itself as Beacon Hill’s “most exclusive venue to capture a parking space,” operates as a condominium; the spots are sold privately as deeded, taxable pieces of property.When homes are sold on Beacon Hill, the sellers usually include the value of their parking spaces in the overall sale price. Oftentimes, the deeds to the spaces are transferred by a symbolic payment, Rodriguez said.“When [sellers] go to record the sale of the house, they also record the sale of the parking because it’s a fully separate deed, and they’ll just record it as $1,” he said. “So we actually don’t know what the true value was ... for that parking space.”But when parking spaces come on the market separately, they can fetch well over half a million dollars.“The owners of this space thought it made more sense to bring it to market and see what the market would bear,” Rodriguez said.In 1979, single parking spaces at the Brimmer were being sold for $7,500, or roughly $35,000 in today’s money, according to the garage’s website.AdvertisementLast year, the most expensive parking spot in the garage sold for $565,000, Rodriguez said.It’s rare for a parking space at a “full service” garage like the Brimmer to come on the market, he said.“If you’re spending $5 million, $10 million, $20 million for a house on the Hill and you don’t have any parking — at that point, for purchasing a spot, it becomes splitting hairs whether you pay $500,000 or $600,[000] or $700,000,” he said.Camilo Fonseca can be reached at camilo.fonseca@globe.com.

       "  'subhead': 'Apartment buildings need a lot of wood. And around here, wood mostly comes from Canada.',\n",
       "  'content': 'There are two main ingredients in cost of building housing: labor and materials. Here in New England especially — where builders have long wrestled with the cost of construction — the 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports instituted this week by President Trump will make the latter even more expensive.Much of the softwood lumber and mass timber that goes into apartment buildings in Massachusetts comes from Canada, as does fabricated steel and aluminum. While costs vary, it’s typical for materials to make up between 40 and 50 percent of a construction budget — with anywhere from 6 to 12 percent of that coming from imported goods, said Mike Kearns, chief operating officer of the New England region for construction management firm Shawmut Design and Construction in Boston.New tariffs are likely to spark a domino effect on costs, he says. A 25 percent premium on Canadian lumber could prompt a run on domestic suppliers — a market that’s already at maximum capacity, Kearns said — which will in turn likely bring those domestic prices up, and further extend an already stressed supply chain.Related: The $600,000 problem: Why it costs so much to build housing in Greater BostonAdvertisementBuilders are constantly on the hunt for ways to bring costs down, but the tariffs are likely to affect whether a project’s economics work — and whether builders can build. Indeed, in the Northeast, lumber costs comprise typically 15 to 18 percent of the cost of building a new home.“It’s always this balancing act,” Kearns said. “If that value proposition isn’t there, then that’s when you could see something pause.”Kearns stressed, however, that the industry is “a long way from seeing [tariffs] shut down work,” and that there are ways to navigate costs.Still, any adjustment in the existing tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber results in almost universal groans among wood suppliers who watch the changes closely, said Paul Rogers, purchasing manager at Shepley Wood Products, a supplier with offices in Hyannis, Nantucket, and Wellfleet. If the price of Canadian lumber effectively goes up 25 percent, the price charged by American mills in turn “goes up in sympathy,” Rogers said.“Everybody follows the numbers,” Rogers said. “It doesn’t matter what side of the border it’s coming from.”AdvertisementThe margin on lumber is already slim — “in the single digits,” Rogers said — and tariffs further limit a lumber supplier’s ability to negotiate pricing. Canadian softwood lumber like spruce, pine, and fir have carried tariffs since 1980, said Shepley president Tony Shepley. Now those will go up even higher.An apartment building under construction in Everett in 2023.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffFor development projects in the Northeast, architects will often specify that they want Canadian softwood lumber — both for how it’s grown and how it survives in the Northeastern climate, said Rita Ferris, president of the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association, which represents independent lumber and building material suppliers from Maine to Washington, D.C.There’s huge concern about tariffs further slowing development of residential housing, which has already faced huge cost pressures, Ferris said.“We just don’t grow enough of our own to meet our own demands,” Ferris said. “We totally get the goal of putting America first and having American workers and all of that. But if you can’t supply yourself, it’s really an extra burden.”Tariffs are of course nothing new to the construction industry. Prior presidential administrations have instituted tariffs on materials including steel and lumber, boosting their overall price, wrote Paul Brussow, president of Rider Levett Bucknall North America, in the firm’s recent quarterly construction cost report. That report saw typical costs in Boston climb 5.4 percent over the last year, second only to Chicago among major markets.“While tariffs have had an impact, it was nothing compared to what inflation has done in recent years,” Brussow wrote in January. “When coupled with inflation and labor shortages, this trifecta, in the last few years, has strained supply chains, raised construction costs, and affected project timelines.”Related: A 10,000-unit housing development at Suffolk Downs is on hold indefinitely. Here’s why.AdvertisementAdditional tariffs “are more likely to exacerbate these challenges, particularly for metals, plastics, and essential construction materials, potentially adding thousands to the cost of residential and commercial projects,” Brussow wrote.For Riverdale Mills, a Northbridge company that makes steel wire mesh used in products like fences and lobster traps, the new tariffs are a one-two punch of bad news. Riverdale buys much of its steel from Canada — and an additional 25 percent tariff on steel will kick in on March 12. So by mid-month, the company will be paying 50 percent more for its most important raw material.The company’s chief executive, James Knott Jr., said Riverdale can’t avoid the tariffs by buying American steel, because US steelmakers used the tariffs as an excuse to jack up their own prices. They didn’t even wait for the tariffs to begin.“Back in February, the domestic guys all raised their prices in advance of those tariffs,” Knott said.Knott has no intention of switching to a US source.“Rather than buy from a domestic supplier, I’m going to buy from my reliable supplier in Canada,” said Knott, “because all the prices are equal.”Ironically, Knott said that most of the US suppliers are foreign-owned, but his Canadian supplier is owned by a US firm.The tariffs will harm him in another way, said Knott. About 35 to 45 percent of Riverdale’s products are exported. But since the tariffs have boosted his production costs, his exported steel mesh will be too expensive to compete on world markets.Meanwhile Shepley of Shepley Wood Products said he would hope for “common sense and cooler heads” to prevail.Advertisement“It’s our mission as an industry to protect consumers, to not let housing get driven further out of reach, and to get things settled down,” Shepley said. “So this was a bit of a shock to the system, but we’ll hope that everybody pulls themselves together and gets this going.”Steel and lumber, two major components in housing construction, both face substantial price increases amid 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada.David L.

       "  'content': 'In the latest test for Boston’s beleaguered office market, Rockpoint Group is preparing to put the two interconnected offices at 75-101 Federal St. in downtown Boston on the market in partnership with Wells Fargo, and is tapping brokerage Newmark to market the buildings for sale in the coming weeks, The Boston Globe has learned.Three real estate industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the pending listing. Rockpoint and Wells Fargo both declined to comment, while a representative for Newmark did not respond.The complex spans about 853,000 square feet and is about 71 percent occupied, according to data from real estate firm CoStar Group.Related: One of Boston’s skyline-defining towers is on the auction block — and expected to sell at a big discountThe pending sale comes amid a broad price reset for Boston’s office market, with a growing roster of towers going up for sale for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shook up demand for office space. Real estate experts expect downtown properties could be worth between 40 percent and 60 percent less than they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and several recent sales bear out that thesis.Rockpoint Group has owned 75-101 Federal, at least in part, since 2015, when it purchased the conjoined offices for $326.5 million. Rockpoint sold a 50 percent stake in the buildings to Carr Properties in March 2020 — the very same week COVID was declared a national emergency — for about $185 more per square foot than it had paid five years previously. (Carr sold its stake back to Rockpoint last year for an undisclosed price). Also that week, Rockpoint and Carr finalized a $292 million mortgage with Wells Fargo, according to Suffolk County records, a mortgage with a maturity date of March 12, 2025.AdvertisementThe 75-101 Federal St. buildings have entrances on both Federal and Devonshire streets in downtown Boston. Here, one of the towers is reflected in the facade of 100 Federal St. David L. Ryan/Globe StaffThe brick and stone 75 Federal St. building dates to 1929 and was once described by the Boston Landmarks Commission as “the most elaborately decorative Art Deco skyscraper standing in Boston.” The 31-story tower at 101 Federal St. was built as an adjoining office in 1988. The towers are connected by a block-long lobby linking their two entrances — one on Federal Street, the other on Devonshire Street — that was renovated in 2016.AdvertisementTwo real estate industry sources said Rockpoint and Wells Fargo are working closely on the sale and collectively decided to bring Newmark’s capital markets team in to market the property. The 262,000-square-foot 75 Federal St. is 78 percent occupied, while the 591,000-square-foot 101 Federal St. is 64 percent occupied, according to CoStar.Related: Take a look at the first skyscraper proposed in downtown Boston since the pandemicIt’s not clear for how much the towers could sell. Several recent deals have seen properties trade at big discounts, with significant implications for both the city’s tax base and their owners’ balance sheets.For example, after purchasing 179 Lincoln St. near South Station in January 2020 for $155.7 million, a Blackstone entity sold the five-story building to Boston’s Synergy Investments last March for $76.5 million — a 51 percent price decline, according to research from Avison Young. Also last March, Synergy purchased 101 Arch St. in Downtown Crossing for $78 million — some 36 percent less than it sold for in 2005, and some $11 million less than the property had sold for in 2002.Catherine Carlock can be reached at catherine.carlock@globe.com.

Under a plan approved in 2023, Winn and the authority plan to raise /$2 billion over the next two decades to redevelop the entire 30-acre complex into a mixed-income, mixed-use property with 3,300 apartments, retail space, and a community center.The first phase, dubbed Building A, will also include a new Veterans Park with an accessible tot lot, bike lane, new trees, and reconfigured streets safer for pedestrians.Advertisement“For almost nine decades, Mary Ellen McCormack has been a cornerstone of Boston’s commitment to affordable housing,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “Today, we take a major step forward in ensuring that this historic community remains a vibrant, inclusive home for generations to come.”Tenants have been involved in planning the entire project, according to Carol Sullivan, executive director of the Mary Ellen McCormack Task Force, a resident advocacy group. “I am very proud of this partnership and cannot wait to see the smiles on the residents’ faces when they move into their new, affordable homes,” Sullivan said in a statement.An artist's rendering of the first building in the planned redevelopment of South Boston's Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex.The Architectural TeamWinnCompanies chief executive Gilbert Winn said the redevelopment project would be a model for similar projects across the country. “This first building jumpstarts an ambitious and inspired undertaking many years in the making that will ultimately give rise to a new mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood,” Winn said in a statement.Ed Flynn, who represents the McCormack area on the City Council, said the redevelopment’s new park and community center will offer improvements to benefit all South Boston residents. “I couldn’t be more excited to see it through to completion in 2026,” Flynn said in an email.The project’s financing, $62 million for the building and $8 million for infrastructure, came from a variety of sources including a construction loan from Bank of America, federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Energy Tax Credit equity from Bank of America, a tax-exempt bridge loan and tax-exempt first mortgage loan from MassHousing, and a subordinate loan from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund maintained by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing & Livable Communities.AdvertisementThe McCormack project, built during the Great Depression, currently includes 1,016 deeply subsidized apartments across 35 buildings.

       "  'content': 'For the last six years, Annie Gordon has not gone a day without worrying about facing eviction or a huge rent increase.Now, she can relax.Developer Related Beal, with financial backing from the City of Boston, is buying the 347-unit Mattapan apartment complex where Gordon has lived for nearly 50 years and setting rents at affordable rates, putting an end to a lengthy saga that saw fixed-income tenants battle with a landlord that bought the property in 2018 and raised rents dramatically.“The feeling is overwhelming relief,” said Gordon, who is 74. “When I got the call with the news, I couldn’t even believe it because we’ve been fighting, trying to stay in our homes for so long. There’s still a part of me that can’t believe it. We fought so hard, and we actually won.”AdvertisementSome tenants wept when they heard the news, Gordon said.“The toll this took on all of us,” she said, “was huge.”The city is contributing more than $10 million to the purchase to guarantee affordable rents for all of the units, as well as protections against big rent increases, officials said at a press conference at Fairlawn Estates, as the property was known before it was purchased in 2018. Half of the units will be set at rents affordable to tenants making 60 percent of the area median income, or $78,360 for a household of two, and the other half will be set at 80 percent AMI. Related’s deal with the city also caps annual rent increases at 2 percent a year.Related’s affiliate, Related Affordable, would not say how much they are spending to purchase the 12-building property, but DSF Group paid $65 million to buy it in 2018.Boston’s $10 million contribution is coming through its Acquisition Opportunity Program, which provides funding to community and housing groups to finance the purchase of market-rate housing to be maintained as permanently affordable. The groups behind the transactions can borrow against the city’s contribution to obtain additional capital. In this case, the city said it was able to secure nine times its $10 million investment in private funds.At 347 units, Related’s purchase of the Mattapan property is by far the largest such acquisition under the AOP. In 2022, the city helped finance the purchase of 36 small apartment buildings totaling 114 apartments in East Boston for affordable housing.Related: Leader of Mattapan tenant organization staves off eviction ... for nowAdvertisementThe program is part of a broader strategy by Mayor Michelle Wu that has seen the city pour hundreds of millions of pandemic recovery dollars into the construction and acquisition of affordable housing. By purchasing market-rate homes, the city can avoid the prohibitive costs it takes to build new affordable housing, while maintaining buildings in neighborhoods that are gentrifying rapidly.“The City of Boston is so proud to play a role in restoring Fairlawn as an affordable home, because for decades, these units were known that way: an affordable place to raise a family,” Wu said Monday. “Over the last few years especially, the rent here was hiked up ... and families were forced out of Fairlawn, out of Mattapan, and out of the city.”Now, “it’s a new day,” said city housing chief Sheila Dillon.Fairlawn was built in the 1960s off Mattapan’s Bismarck Street, and it eventually became a community cornerstone because its cheap rents supported a community of longtime tenants, some of whom live on fixed incomes.Annie Gordon in her Mattapan apartment in June 2020.Pat Greenhouse/Globe StaffA few of those tenants spent years advocating for the addition of the Mattapan commuter rail stop, but when it was finally built, the apartment complex became attractive for prospective investors, Gordon said.That’s when DSF bought the place. Rents immediately rose, in some cases, by hundreds of dollars. Many tenants couldn’t afford the increases. Some left, but others stayed and fought, refusing to pay the increases and forming a tenant association with the help of tenant group City Life/Vida Urbana.Related: From 2022: In East Boston, a big move to keep renters in their homesAdvertisementLast year, DSF moved to evict Gordon, but a judge sided with her and let her stay.“Tenants have been traumatized by this,” said Gabrielle Rene, the Mattapan community organizer for City Life. “This has been years of pain and struggle.”The saga at Fairlawn Estates highlights how vulnerable many residents of the city are to big rent increases, and why policy makers should prioritize protections for renters, said Gordon. People like Gordon would benefit directly from something like rent control, she said. And the city should also pass the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would require landlords to give tenants and housing groups the opportunity to purchase apartment buildings before they go up for sale on the private market, she said.Related’s purchase is a rare victory for tenants in a city where apartment buildings change hands and rents soar frequently. Many of those sales have much different endings.“We’re grateful,” said Gordon. “I’m grateful I get to stay in my home.”Residents and advocates gave a round of applause during the announcement Monday. They have long protested the current owner of the Fairlawn apartments.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com. Follow him @andrewnbrinker.',\n",

       "  'content': \"It is a freezing winter evening, and Thomas Macdonald cannot find apartment 41A.He figured it would be on the fifth floor of this 19th century building in Boston’s Symphony neighborhood, but there, the highest number was 39. Now a bead of sweat dribbles down the side of his forehead as he leads a trio of Northeastern University students in sweatpants back down four flights of creaking stairs and into a narrow basement.Roughly 10 minutes of searching and two calls to the building owner later, he finally discovers apartment 41A, at the bottom of an outdoor staircase that is hidden by a stand of bushes.Now, he can go to work.The current occupants of unit 41A sit awkwardly in their bedrooms as Macdonald leads the students around the basement apartment. The place smells vaguely of cat urine, and there is a network of pipes running across the ceiling that may, or may not, transport the building’s sewage. Macdonald explains that if they want a three-bedroom for around $4,500, this is the most spacious option they’ll find.Related: What’s the rent where you live? See the latest rental costs in towns around Mass.Advertisement“You have to be straightforward with people about what’s realistic for them,” Macdonald says after the tour as he walks back to his Honda Civic, parked hastily behind a food truck. “They already hate us.”By “us,” Macdonald means Boston’s army of rental brokers, and “hate” may in fact be an accurate descriptor of how many renters feel about them.The word “broker” is a charged term in Boston these days, invoking a sense of dread — a knot in the stomach — among renters who associate them with jingling rings of apartment keys, ill-planned tours, and the often-massive sum they demand, known as a broker’s fee, before you can sign a lease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroker Thomas Macdonald checks out an Allston apartment.  \\n   \\t\\t(John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Macdonald photographs the unit for his company's website.\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\t (John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\\n\\nThat fee is typically equal to a month of rent, and combined with a security deposit and other required payments, can contribute to a five-figure upfront move-in cost in a rental market that is already jaw-droppingly expensive and stacked against renters.But beyond the dollars, much of the antipathy toward brokers stems from the fact that many renters do not see what, if anything, brokers do on their behalf.AdvertisementWith the ubiquity of online listings, renters can easily search for apartments themselves, yet in many cases, they still have to pay a broker to sign a lease. And after New York City outlawed tenant-paid broker fees last year, Boston and neighboring cities like Cambridge and Somerville constitute the only major urban center in the United States where renters are obligated to pay.Related: Renters hate to pay broker fees. Could this be the year those fees go away?That could soon change. Momentum is building for a law in Boston that would charge the fees to whoever hires the broker between the landlord and the renter, rather than allowing landlords to decide. Key legislators have signaled their support, and Governor Maura Healey has signed on.Some brokers have taken that recent push as an affront on their profession, and warn that the housing market cannot function without them. Their job, they say, is to find renters a good deal.Renters aren’t so sure.“We’re expected to pay this guy?” one of the students remarked under his breath as Macdonald wandered through the Symphony building searching for apartment 41A.Macdonald has only been a broker for a few years, but he knows the business. He wears a navy suit bulky enough for a professional wrestler and oozes with the confidence of a 22-year-old, which he is. He crushes energy drinks instead of coffee, and the empty cans litter his car’s floorboards. He fires off text messages at red lights, because, he says, “time is money.” He hopes to parlay the money he makes leasing rentals into investment properties someday.Related: NYC is about to make landlords cover most brokers fees. Will Boston follow suit?Macdonald is the youngest broker at Jacob Realty on Newbury Street, one of a handful of brokerages run by Boston real estate mogul Demetrios Salpoglou. He lives with his parents in New Hampshire and starts his day around 7:30 a.m., after an hour’s drive to work.AdvertisementOn a recent day, Macdonald settles into his desk near a drafty window overlooking Newbury Street. The room fills with chatter of brokers calling landlords and loudly drafting voice-to-text messages to prospective tenants. In a back room, there is a wall with thousands of keys to apartments Jacob helps rent.Thomas Macdonald sat at his desk in the Jacob Realty office on Newbury Street.David L. Ryan/Globe StaffMacdonald usually starts his days scanning Salpoglou’s database of 215,000 rental units for apartments that are about to hit the market or that have lingered for awhile.This morning, he has spotted a couple of one-bedrooms in Allston that are about to hit the market, both renting for over $2,000 a month.“Can you make the moving costs any easier?” he asks the landlord on the phone, angling for a sweetener he can offer would-be tenants, like a break on the security deposit.The landlord says no.Real estate brokers have been around in Boston for as long as people have needed homes. Brokers say they serve an important purpose: helping people navigate the cutthroat housing market to find a home where they can build their lives. But they tend to work mostly on behalf of landlords in this housing market, where homes are in high demand. Those owners typically have enough leverage to push the broker fee off to their tenants.Sites like Zillow and Apartment List allow apartment-hunters to narrow down options, but in many cases, they can’t tour a unit without interacting with a broker who has listed the place on a landlord’s behalf.It can be a lucrative venture. Macdonald would not say how much he makes in a year, but its an eat-what-you-kill business. Most rental brokers’ compensation consists entirely of fees they charge on apartment rentals, and it can vary widely from broker to broker. A successful broker can easily make six figures by leasing expensive apartments at an efficient clip. Others who lease just a few units a month make considerably less. There are thousands of brokers in Boston battling for the listings and leases of the city’s more than 300,000 apartments. On Newbury Street alone, there are several dozen brokerages.Advertisement“Brokers and leasing agents provide a valuable service, and we get compensated for those services,” said Eric Shabshelowitz, vice president of the luxury real estate agency Cabot & Company. “Years ago, it was landlords who paid the fee, but the market has changed.”Related: Governor Healey announces plan to eliminate renter-paid broker feesSome brokers focus on hawking cheaper rentals to Boston’s flood of college students. Others work in specific neighborhoods.Rob Oteri, who founded the rental site JPRentals, focuses mainly on apartments in Jamaica Plain, where he lives. He said he tries to maintain personal relationships with landlords and works diligently with prospective renters to help them find the best place for them in their price range.When brokers do their job well, Oteri said, the fee shouldn’t be quite so painful. But theirs is a volume business, and some brokers simply try to lease as many units as possible as quickly as possible. That leads to instances, he said, when brokers show up to lead apartment tours without ever having seen the unit.“I certainly understand the frustration with some brokers who maybe have a ‘turn and burn’ mentality about the work,” Oteri said. “But a good broker earns their money by working closely with tenants to get them the best deal.”AdvertisementMacdonald’s day has taken him into Allston, near Commonwealth Avenue, where he has picked up keys from one of the city’s biggest student landlords, Alpha Management, so he can take photos of Alpha apartments that will soon come on the market.His first stop is a clean but tiny one-bedroom with a closet too thin for a person to stand in. It has nice natural light and a full kitchen.“This one will go fast,” he says while taking note of the “standalone closet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThomas Macdonald checks out an apartment in Allston before creating a listing on his brokerage's website.\\n   \\t\\t(John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Macdonald on the phone in the Jacob Realty office.\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\t (John Tlumacki/Globe Staff)\\n\\nAs he drives toward his next stop, he defends the value of his profession.Finding apartments without brokers, he says, would be harder, because there would be no one to cultivate and centralize listings and organize tours. And his knowledge of the market helps him find renters the best deals, which is his top priority.“It’s the free market,” he says. “I love it.”Related: Renters are vexed by broker fees. Brokers say they earn their money.The next unit, a few blocks away, is quite different: An upper-floor studio with a big window and a sprawling view of the city. There’s a new mattress, a large bag of marijuana on top of the fridge, and a fresh eviction notice in the entryway. Macdonald takes a few photos.Then he shows those Northeastern students the basement apartment and returns to the office, where he begins posting his photos and updating listings on Jacob’s website. He also looks around for more three-bedroom options for the students.Around 8 p.m., Macdonald gets a text.Thanks for showing us around. My roommates and I will be looking elsewhere.He curses and lets out a sigh.“That’s the name of the game — I did all of that work, showed those kids around, and at the end of the day, I didn’t make a dime,” Macdonald says. “Gotta work harder tomorrow.”View SurveyAndrew Brinker can be reached at andrew.brinker@globe.com.

       "  'content': 'ByRobyn A. Friedman -- Globe Correspondent\\nIf you’re buying a condo, you’ve probably reviewed the rules and regulations of the condominium association to confirm they don’t conflict with your planned use of the property. But did you check out the association itself? Failing to ensure that the association’s finances are healthy can lead to huge bills for unsuspecting unit owners.\\n“The worst-case scenario is that a buyer could have a special assessment in the thousands of dollars,’’ saidLinda Barrett, vice president of Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boston. “Should the building’s roof need to be replaced, you could end up with a very high special assessment if the association does not have good reserves.’’\\nOwners of condominiums pay regular assessments, usually monthly or quarterly, to cover the operating expenses of the association, as well as reserves — funds stashed away for future capital projects. But condo associations also can charge unit owners special assessments for emergencies or unusual circumstances, such as damage to the building caused by a winter storm.\\nThat’s why Barrett always prepares her condo buyers beforehand. “It’s my job to make sure buyers not only review the condominium documents, but two years of the budget as well,’’ she said. When she writes an offer, she also includes a contingency allowing the buyer to review the minutes of association board meetings for the past two years. “You could read in the minutes from a year ago that there’s a problem with the roof,’’ she said. That could signal that a special assessment is in your future.\\nRelatedSticker shock: Special assessments can send condo costs even higher. What buyers should be asking.\\n\\nPrior to closing on a one-bedroom condominium in Boston’s Seaport District two years ago, Anne Stemlar, a legal administrator in Boston, reviewed the association’s financial statements. “I was looking at the health of the organization and what kind of financial reserves they had,’’ Stemlar said.\\nStemlar concluded that the association was well run, with healthy reserves, a capital budget, and a plan for improvements. But she had an advantage since she had owned two units previously and served on a condo association board of directors. First-time buyers should rely on their real estate agent and lawyer for help reviewing these documents. “Ask a lot of questions, and make sure you come to a comfort level,’’ Stemlar said.\\nIn addition to reviewing the rules and regulations of the association to ensure you won’t be in violation if you own a large dog, drive a truck, or want to rent your unit, be sure to conduct the following due diligence on the financial stability of the association:\\n■\\xa0Review the past two operating budgets, as well as two years’ worth of board and annual meeting minutes. Be wary if assessments haven’t increased over time; since the cost of goods and services have gone up, maintenance fees should have followed.\\n■\\xa0Review the reserve study of the major capital components of the building, and make sure there are adequate funds to replace them on schedule.\\n■\\xa0Ask questions. Dawn Bauman, senior vice president for government and public affairs at theCommunity Associations Institute, an industry group, said condo buyers should inquire about routine maintenance of the building, whether the board expects to increase assessments, and whether there is a current special assessment or one pending or imminent. Try to talk to the seller, the property manager, and board members.\\n■\\xa0Be skeptical about the operating budget for new construction. Developers often subsidize the expenses of the association by paying costs such as landscaping or snow removal, so it’s common for assessments to increase once the unit owners take control of the association.\\n■\\xa0Don’t ignore insurance.Spencer M. Houldin, president of Ericson Insurance Advisors in Boston, suggested that condo buyers determine the insurance obligations of both the association and the unit owners. Typically, Houldin said, the association insures the building, while owners are responsible for everything inside their units. Have your insurance agent or lawyer review the association’s insurance to make sure it’s sufficient to rebuild the structure. All unit owners should carry anHO-6 policythat covers the interior of their units and liability.\\n■\\xa0Don’t waive your right to review association financials. “It’s a seller’s market, and buyers are willing to overlook things like reserves because they’re just happy they found a place and their offer was accepted,’’ saidMichael Merrill, a real estate and condominium law attorney in Boston. But even if you waive mortgage and inspection contingencies, be wary of waiving a budget review.\\n“That way, when you do become an owner, you’re not surprised by the amount of money you may have to put in to solve a problem,’’ Merrill said.\\nRobyn A.

       "  'subhead': '“I do have ideas for what I want to grow, but whatever works.”',\n",
       "  'content': 'By Lindsay Crudele, The Boston Globe\\n\\nWhen it comes to online gardening trends and how they translate to reality, mileage can vary.\\n\\n“Chaos gardening” lit upTikToklast year, its advocates tossing fistfuls of seed into soil — or even grass — while seeming to hope fora wildflower meadow. There are reasons that a planned approach can yield more reliable results: crowding plants can outcompete one another, and not all seeds will thrive in every yard placement. But for some who practice it in the Boston area, chaos gardening is more than an online trend: It’s a longtime mindset they say has helped them maintain a more forgiving relationship with their spaces, easing up on their expectations and enjoying the garden on its own terms.\\n\\n“I do have ideas for what I want to grow, but whatever works,” said Dana Werbin, who gardens in Jamaica Plain. “If a seed grows there, that means it likes the conditions.”\\n\\nIt’s not that Werbin’s approach lacks design: It’s just that the garden is, to a greater extent than some, also the designer. Their “volunteer” tomatoes — ones that sprout from dropped seeds, tend to do better than planted seedlings, for example.\\n\\n“I could make the decision to rip it up and plant it elsewhere, but it already made the decision that it likes where it is, so I’m not gonna mess that up,” they said, “because it’s going to give me good tomatoes.”\\n\\nWerbin’s description of their garden is a picture of both chaos and order. They don’t know exactly where something will grow, but the garden will let them know. That’s where they will find the scallions this season.\\n\\n“It’s a percentage of, like, 70 percent chaos, 30 percent order,” they said.\\n\\nFor Kris Engdahl, the decision opened up a neighborhood conversation.\\n\\n\\nShe sees her chaos garden approach as an outcropping ofmilpa gardening, a sustainable and regenerative indigenous practice related to the “three sisters” method of planting corn, beans, and squash together. Engdahl’s Watertown front yard received a lot of street salt, which seemed to encourage crabgrass. So, she tore it up and tried flowers: roses, marigolds, and impatiens. But her interest turned to growing food, and she thought,why not?She replaced flowers with a range of vegetables and herbs. Sometimes she added more flowers. Sometimes, tricolor chard. She followed her whims, and soon the garden followed its own.\\n\\n\\nAs  it evolved, the garden’s proximity to the sidewalk attracted interest. Located a short walk to a community path, the foot traffic is frequent. The variety became a magnetic conversation-starter. A group of passersby, with her permission, harvested cilantro. A woman took chard and returned the next day with a delicious recipe she made with it.\\n\\nWith each season, different plantings would express themselves with more or less influence. One year, Engdahl’s garden was dominated by dill and daikon (white radish). Sometimes pumpkins popped up; sometimes green beans would thrive.\\n\\nAnd while it can feel that way to Engdahl, to its admirers, the garden was not independent from its gardener. Last year, Engdahl said she fell behind on maintenance — stymied, as we all experience — by life and the heat wave. And even during these cold intermediate months, someone checked in.\\n\\n“I had somebody on Sunday [ask]: ‘How are you doing? We love looking at your garden. I was concerned about you,’” she said.\\n\\nSometimes the balance will seem off in some way, and Engdahl will correct it. One season’s parsley, which produced months of winter broths, became next season’s rabbit food.\\n\\n“Sometimes I will do something, and it will be wrong, but gardens are dynamic,” she said. She plans to continue this year, following up on her practice of “no dig” gardening, adding her own homemade compost.\\n\\nGarden designerDemetra Tseckareshas found the chaos gardening mindset useful when responding to clients who are looking for lower maintenance. Meadows are a great fit for replacing a sunny lawn. Tseckares will hand-seed the area, but is careful to select intentionally, avoiding pre-sold mixes that can often include invasive or aggressive plant species.\\n\\n“I’ve been trying to get people to understand what a beautiful garden looks like in a different way, because these super neat, super tidy … cleaned-up gardens that don’t allow a single leaf or a single stem to stand are dead zones, they kill an entire generation,” Tseckares said of the insects that may use stems and leaves for habitat, supporting other parts of the wildlife population.\\n\\nAnd it’s a more sustainable approach — including financially.\\n\\n“You can change it every year, or it will just do its own thing,” she said, noting that gardeners can harvest seeds at the end of the season for next year’s plantings.\\n\\nWerbin’s next season, like many gardeners, will begin well before the last frost. Using a small greenhouse, they will start seedlings during the cold season. But they also will practice experimental sowing with a packet of their own mixed seeds as an intentional surprise, to see what comes up.\\n\\nNot every experiment is fruitful. Last year, Werbin nurtured a plant they thought was ginger. It turned out to be grass.\\n\\n“I was giving so much love to this weed, thinking that it was going to turn into something, and it wasn’t,” they said.\\n\\nBut care and forgiveness are never wasted. Now Werbin, who has a professional horticulture background, is studying for a career pivot into nursing.\\n\\n“Cultivating a rapport with your patients is just like getting the soil ready,” she said. Their approach to gardening required openness and nonjudgmental thinking. They talk to their plants. And they are carrying that practice into their nursing study.\\n\\n“I wouldn’t be the same student nurse, if I didn’t have that experience,” said Werbin.\\n\\nLindsay Crudele can be reached at[email\\xa0protected].\\n\\n\\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

       "  'content': 'By Ann Carrns, New York Times Service\\n\\nWishing you could buy a home? It can be challenging to save enough for a down payment, given how much houses now cost.\\n\\nBut many people don’t realize myriad programs offer grants or loans to help home buyers come up with the necessary funds. “There are tons of programs to assist them,” said Deatra Kemp, an advocate for first-time home buyers in Milwaukee.\\n\\nThe programs can ease some of the daunting numbers behind buying a house. The median price of a home has risen to more than $400,000, meaning the once-traditional 20 percent down payment — an amount paid in cash toward the purchase of a home, in addition to the amount borrowed for a mortgage — would be about $80,000. And typical house prices are significantly higher in some parts of the country like Massachusetts. The Warren Group reported Tuesday that the median sales price for a single-family home in the state hit $615,000 in December, a year-over-year jump of 11.1 percent. The median condo price in Massachusetts was $521,750, a 5 percent increase.\\n\\nEven putting down 5 percent to 10 percent is a stretch because rising rents have made it harder for people to save, said Teig Whaley-Smith, chief alliance executive for the Community Development Alliance, a nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes affordable homeownership as a path to racial equity. “For working families,” he said, “that’s next to impossible.”\\n\\nPlus, increasing mortgage interest rates, which drive up monthly costs, don’t help. Last week, rates fora 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose above 7 percentfor the first time since May, according toFreddie Mac, the federally backed mortgage finance giant.\\n\\nSonu Mittal, senior vice president and head of the single-family acquisitions division at Freddie Mac, said that outside of high prices and interest rates, which consumers can’t control, raising a down payment “continues to be the No. 1 barrier to homeownership.”\\n\\nBut down-payment assistance options can help buyers come up with the necessary cash. When combined with loan programs that allow buyers to put less money down — as little as 3 percent of the home’s purchase price, in some cases — the help can make buying a home a reality.\\n\\nIt’s also possible in some cases to put no money down. Two federal government programs offer zero percent down-payment loans to borrowers who meet specific criteria. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers full financing for veterans and those on active military duty, and the Department of Agriculture guarantees zero percent down-payment loans in rural areas.\\n\\n“Twenty-percent down is a myth,” Kemp said. The typical down payment for first-time buyers in 2024 was 9 percent, according to theNational Association of Realtors. Yet the notion that higher down payments are needed persists. As a result, many people of modest means don’t even consider the notion of owning a home, said Kemp, vice president of programs atActs Housing, a nonprofit that provides financial coaching and other services to help renters become homeowners.\\n\\nStill, finding the right assistance program isn’t easy.A 2023 report from the Urban Institute,a nonprofit research group, identified more than 1,600 government programs across the country designed to help with down payments. Some are offered by the federal government, others by state housing finance agencies or county and local governments. Community-funded organizations and even commercial lenders may also offer help.\\n\\nMost, but not all, programs serve first-time buyers, and most set income limits for borrowers — typically based on the median income in the home’s area. The dizzying assortment of programs, which have varying criteria and geographic restrictions, can make it challenging to identify and apply for available help.\\n\\n“Home buyers don’t know where to start,” said Ashley Moore, community lending manager withChase Home Lendingin Houston.\\n\\nSome programs offer grants, which don’t need to be repaid, but most offer help in the form of a low- or no-interest second mortgage, meaning there is additional debt on the home. Payments on the loans, however, are often deferred, meaning you don’t have to start paying them back right away, and the loans may be forgiven if you remain in the home for a certain period of time — often five years.\\nMore on home buyingMore home buyers are asking relatives for down payment helpMedian down payment tops $105k for metro Boston home buyersSpring House Hunt: Why you don’t need 20% down to buy a home\\nJung Hyun Choi, principal research associate for the Urban Institute’s housing finance policy center, said borrowers may combine benefits of several different down-payment programs, a practice sometimes called “stacking,” to come up with the necessary funds. But it can take time and effort to find and apply for various programs. “It’s pretty complicated,” she said, and can drag out the buying process.\\n\\nGroups like Acts Housing seek to help borrowers identify the right programs and often find that borrowers are eligible for more than one. “We love to stack,” Kemp said.\\n\\nActs Housing recently worked with a buyer who was able to get $19,500 in down-payment assistance from a combination of grants from federal and private lenders and a city program, she said. The buyer put down less than $700 out of pocket at closing for a home in Milwaukee.\\n\\n“Get all the grants you deserve,” Kemp said. “Don’t leave any money on the table.”\\n\\nThe borrower, Latoya Myrick, 44, who works in community services, said the assistance had enabled her to buy a duplex for about $200,000, realizing a longtime goal of owning her own home. She had tried before, she said, but didn’t have enough for a down payment. She closed on Jan. 6 and will soon move in. “I’m so grateful.”\\n\\nOther resources are emerging to help home buyers find down-payment assistance. Freddie Mac in late 2023 began offering a free online search tool,DPA One,to help lenders and housing counselors match eligible borrowers with down-payment help.\\n\\n“Loan officers may not even know there is a program available,” Mittal said. “We want to make sure we don’t miss those opportunities.”\\n\\nIt’s too soon to say how many homes have been purchased because of the new offering, Mittal said, but the tool is gaining traction. About 7,000 loan officers use the tool, which now has information on about 800 programs across 50 states and the District of Columbia. (Home buyers can try DPA One, but it’s mainly intended for professionals.)\\n\\nAnother option isDown Payment Resource, an online search tool. Borrowers enter details about themselves and the type of home they want and can get information about programs for which they may be eligible.\\n\\nYou can also contact your state housing finance authority or work with a housing counseling agency certified by the federalDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentto learn about available programs. You can search on the HUD website for agencies in your area.\\n\\n\\nWill using a down-payment assistance program cause the interest rate on my loan to be higher?\\n\\nSome predatory lenders may charge a higher rate to borrowers using assistance programs, Kemp said. When that happens, counselors at certified housing agencies can work with buyers to find lenders who won’t penalize borrowers using down-payment help, she said.\\n\\nCan I use a family gift to help with a down payment?\\n\\nLenders may allow gifts from close family members to be included as part of a down payment. In 2024, 8 percent of homebuyers (and 21 percent of first-time buyers) said they had used a gift from a relative or friend, according to the National Association of Realtors. You may need to provide a letter signed by the donor to document that the money doesn’t need to be repaid, according to credit bureauExperian.\\n\\nDo private lenders offer assistance with down payments?\\n\\nSome do. Chase, for instance, offers grants of up to $7,500 in eligible areas, including federally identified neighborhoods with majority Black, Hispanic, or Latino populations, that can be used toward a down payment or to reduce a home loan’s interest rate or closing costs.

The price? $7,495,000.\\nThe legendary actress,who died in 1969, rented the home while her daughter,Liza Minnelli, performed at theCape Cod Melody Tent.

Across the room, a bay window offers a sunny spot on a built-in seat.

The newly created Boston Acquisition Fund provided a nearly $1 million commitment.\\nThe Fairlawn Estates comprises 12 apartment buildings and a leasing office on Fairlawn Avenue, Cummins Highway, and Bismarck Street.\\nThe release said the Flatley Companies constructed the complex in the 1960s, and it was known for its affordability. However, in 2018, that all changed when the long-awaited commuter rail stop opened across from the apartment complex. The building was sold to an investor group, and the property was rebranded as SoMa at the T. Residents faced increased rents, which resulted in evictions.\\nThe new owner, Related Affordable, an affiliate of Related Beal, has committed to permanently restricting all 347 units to affordable housing.\\n“Affordable housing is core to Related’s DNA, and we are thrilled to provide a more sustainable living solution in such an important, transit-oriented location in Mattapan,” said Kimberly Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal.\\nThe release said Related Affordable plans to invest $6.4 million in immediate repairs and building upgrades, including roof replacements, balcony repairs, and appliance upgrades in all apartments. Related Affordable will also focus on making the buildings more energy efficient.\\nThe investment will ensure that half the apartments are for households earning no more than 60% of the Area Median Income, while the other half are for those earning no more than 80%.\\nThe agreement with Related also limits rent increases to no more than 2% per year and provides ongoing support for households with housing vouchers.\\nThe conversion to affordable housing follows years of advocacy and organizing by Fairlawn tenants, City Life/Vida Urbana, and neighbors in Mattapan.\\n“The constant stress of facing huge rent increases and eviction weighed on us every day over the past six years, and it wasn’t right — but we want people to know that housing is a human right and we can win the homes we deserve,” said Betty Lewis, of the Fairlawn Tenant Association. “This is a community victory won by neighbors working together.”\\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

       "  'content': 'ByCameron Sperance\\n\\nBaby boomers own a significant chunk of the housing stock in Massachusetts. Don’t count on that changing to solve the housing shortages anytime soon.\\n\\nBaby boomers — those from age 58 to 76 — accounted for nearly 39 percent of the homeowner pool statewide in 2023, according to Redfin’s most recent data.\\n\\nNationwide, about 21 million homes are “empty nests” — those with at least three bedrooms and occupied by residents 55 and up with no children at home,according to Zillow.That has the potential to more than make up for the estimated 4.5 million unit national home shortage.\\n\\nBut for all the talk of a pending “silver tsunami” of generational wealth — and housing — transfer to younger demographics, experts caution this won’t be a flash flood of supply.\\n\\n“A lot of people in our industry have been thinking about this idea that there would be maybe a big wealth transfer, that maybe there would be a lot of baby boomers [with homes] coming on the market at some point,” saidOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. “But unfortunately, our research shows that there’s just not enough of those older families.”\\n\\nBaby boomers also are staying in their homes longer than ever, meaning you likely shouldn’t expect a sudden jolt of new supply:40 percent of American baby boomershave lived in their current homes for at least 20 years, according to Redfin.\\n\\nRedfin also noted empty-nest baby boomers owned 25 percent of large homes (those with at least three bedrooms) in Greater Boston in 2022 — compared to millennials with children owning just 12.5 percent of the supply.\\n\\n\\nWhat’s keeping these older homeowners parked in their current abodes rather than downsizing? Money talks, but the high cost of moving — especially when it pertains to higher mortgage rates compared to what they might have on their existing homes — has caused many to decide not to leave their longtime homes.\\n\\nSeventy-eight percent of baby boomersnationally planned to age in place, an increasingly standard plan for older homeowners, according to Redfin.\\n\\nEmpty nests would need to be more concentrated in markets with the largest housing shortages — like Greater Boston — to make a dent in home prices. But that isn’t the case.\\n\\nIn the local market, Zillow notes there are 281,773 empty nests, or about 14 percent of the local housing supply. That’s slightly less than the 16 percent national average of empty nests found coast to coast.\\n\\n“Boston is a younger place, and there’s just not enough of these older homes available, even if all of them came on the market someday,” Divounguy said.\\n\\nIt’s not just empty nesters occupying larger homes that’s driving some of the supply shortage.\\n\\n“Many baby boomers have had very prosperous careers, and that has led to many of them owning multiple properties, whether it be that they own a primary residence and secondary for vacationing, or perhaps a primary and then also in owning investment properties as part of their portfolio,” saidSarah Gustafson, president of theMassachusetts Association of Realtors. “With that, they’re taking up so much of that available inventory, it’s exacerbating the housing shortage that we’ve seen over the past couple of years.”\\n\\nMany older homeowners just prefer to stay where they are.\\n\\n“The most common reasons [for baby boomers deciding to age in place] are that people like where they live and that there is no good alternative for them,” saidChen Zhao, economics research lead at Redfin. “That’s really what it boils down to.”\\n\\nThink of the pending generational wealth and housing supply transfer more like a trickle than a tsunami, according to the Redfin team. Higher mortgage rates and home prices increase the supply shortage in a market like Greater Boston.\\n\\n“It’s going to be a long while coming,” Zhao said. “Boston has probably one of the tighter home markets and is one of the places where it seems like the market is frozen.”\\n\\nThere are a mix of policy levers a region like Greater Boston can pull to help younger generations with housing accessibility and affordability. Governor Maura Healey’sUnlocking Housing Production Commissionexamined the state’s housing shortage and notedsingle-family-only zoning is a key obstacle, blocking more housing construction.\\n\\nThe commission recommended eliminating single-family zoning across the state in a move that wouldn’t ban single-family homes from being constructed. Instead, the measure would prohibit municipal governments from blocking many multi-unit housing proposals on residential lots.\\n\\n“The solution is not to wait and hope for existing homes to come on the market. It’s to help the builders build more housing,” Zillow’s Divounguy said. “Boston happens to be one of the more restrictive markets in terms of building restrictions. It means loosening some of these building restrictions in the metro area and allowing for more construction.”\\n\\nThere also are much longer-term solutions to some of the housing shortage. Baby boomers and millennials are larger generations, and that presents a multigenerational need for housing.\\n\\nBut declining birth rates in the US and expected lower immigration rates also can mean decreased housing demand in the distant future — emphasis on distant.\\n\\n“I’m not saying it’s going to happen immediately, but at some point this does make a difference for housing demand and our housing shortage,” Zhao said.\\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

The nearly 114-square-foot space does not have a closet but could easily function as a home office or den.\\nBack in the hallway, there’s a glass staircase on the left and a long hallway that features utilities, storage, and laundry. There’s also a full bathroom with a tub and access to a 193-square-foot bedroom that boasts stunning views of the brick-filled neighborhood. Next door to that is a slightly bigger bedroom (198 square feet) that features double-door closets and beautiful views of the neighborhood and Farnsworth Street. The en-suite bath has a glass-enclosed shower and an entrance from the hallway.\\nClimb the glass staircase to the living level, which offers 13-foot ceilings and an open floor plan that the staircase cuts in half. A few steps down, and you’re in the 593-square-foot living room. Grab a seat around the fireplace, which is surrounded by Carrara marble and has wood features above it around a built-in television.

That deck lines the outside of the condo and leads to the 1,022-square-foot main deck, with direct access to the 200-square-foot primary bedroom suite. The suite’s 86-square-foot walk-through closet comes with built-ins and ushers you through to a stunning primary bath that’s home to dual vanities, a shower, and a motorized toilet.\\nThe dining room (134 square feet) is also off the hallway. It features sliding doors that open out to the main deck. The dining area is off the 320-square-foot kitchen, which has an integrated refrigerator and high-gloss white cabinets. A gray stone island anchors the space, which has same pale hardwood flooring that runs throughout the home. There’s also a half bathroom off that room.\\nClimb the glass stairs up another flight to the condo’s beautiful roof deck, which faces the harbor. The 315-square-foot space offers views that stretch into the Financial District.\\nThe condo, which a developer transformed in 2018, has a $677 monthly homeowners association fee. It comes with a parking spot behind the building. A second parking spot is available for rent at the Farnsworth Garage for $500 a month.

       "  'content': 'By ANDRE MUGGIATI, Associated Press\\n\\nWELLFLEET, Mass. (AP) —A luxury home that had been on the verge of tumbling into Cape Cod Baydue to erosion has been demolished.\\n\\nA potential collapse of the 5,100-square-foot home threatened oyster beds in nearby Wellfleet Harbor, but a dispute over its removal had left it teetering on the edge of a sandy bluff for months. But on Monday, heavy machinery rolled in to remove the house piece by piece, with trucks carrying it away. By Tuesday, only its concrete slab, chimney and a generator remained.\\n\\n“On one side, it is sad because it was a beautiful house that became a landmark in that place,” said John Cobler, a member of the Wellfleet Environmental Commission. “On the other, I am happy that it is gone. It is a great relief for our town and for our environment.”\\nA luxury house is close to tumbling into Cape Cod Bay. Will anyone stop it?\\nCobler said attorneys for owner John Bonomi filed a request with the town last week to remove the house. An attorney for Bonomi declined to comment to The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe house was built in 2010 on the bay side of the Cape Cod peninsula. Its original owners sought permission in 2018 to build a seawall to stave off erosion. The commission rejected the seawall out of concern for unintended effects on the beach and how water carries nutrients in the bay. They also questioned whether it would save the house.\\n\\nIn 2019, Bonomi, a New York attorney, bought the house for $5.5 million.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the erosion advanced. A report prepared for Wellfleet last year estimated the house would fall down the bluff within three years, potentially sending debris into a harbor where shellfish farmers grow the town’s namesake oysters, and the environment commission asked Bonomi for a plan to remove the house.\\n\\nJust a week before the demolition, strong winds battered the cape for three days, exposing more of the home’s concrete pillars.\\n\\nAn attorney for Bonomi had told the commission at its January meeting that the house had been sold to a salvage company that would not fund removal of the house. But the town’s conservation agent noted at the time that no transfer of deed had been recorded, and a check of records Tuesday also found no record of sale.\\nSign up for the Today newsletterGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

From the driveway, walk past the deck overlooking the sloping front yard to reach the front door at the top of three stone steps.\\n\\nIt opens into the living room that features a black gas fireplace, and the updated white oak engineered hardwood throughout the house. There are views of the town and harbor.\\n\\n\\nTo the left, a central hallway connects to the rest of the rooms on this level. The first to appear is the fully updated kitchen on the left. It’s a study in white, black, and glistening silver.\\n\\nThe countertops on the large island and the counters are white quartz flecked with gray. The cabinets are white, but the faucet and the island are black. The range is fueled by gas, and the appliances are stainless steel. A slider connects to the backyard, and the ceiling is knotty planks. Beyond the kitchen is a dining area with access to the front deck amid three large double-hung windows.\\n\\n\\nOn the right side of the house is the first full bath, which has a single vanity sink with a quartz top. The shower has a clear glass door with a gray subway tile backsplash.The flooring in both the shower and the bathroom is stone mosaic tile,with radiant heat below the walking space. There is also a large closet and laundry room with space for full-size appliances.\\n\\n\\nCompleting this floor is a large bedroom in the rear of the house.\\n\\nThe primary bedroom is on the second floor in the left corner of the home, providing scenic views from the double-hung windows on two exterior walls. The interior wall is decorated with white shiplap. The entrance to the bathroom is framed by wood timbers and the door itself is a barn-style slider.\\n\\n\\nThe full bath — shared with another bedroom — features a white oval soaking tub and a double vanity with gold faucets, a white quartz countertop, and a Navy blue wood cabinet. The shower is behind gold-framed glass and has a stone mosaic tile floor and a gray tile backsplash. There is a square rain shower head. This bathroom also has radiant heat flooring.\\n\\n\\nOn the other side is another bedroom, now outfitted with a pair of twin beds. There are double-hung windows on two exterior walls.\\n\\nThe third floor can be used as a rec room, but is currently set up with two twin beds along with four comfortable chairs. The walls have shiplap molding and two windows in the corner look out to the harbor.\\n\\nThe basement has a dirt floor and storage space.\\n\\nAccording to the listing agent,Tacy Ridlonof Better Homes & Gardens The Masiello Group in Ellsworth, Maine, Gouldsboro does not restrict rentals in a town where the summer population doubles to about 3,400.\\n\\nJohn R.

       "  'content': 'ByCameron Sperance\\n\\nThe Bay State might have the misfortune of being labeled “Taxachusetts,” but experts point to how it’s not as bad as itcouldbe from a property tax standpoint. That distinction goes to New Jersey — at least this year, anyway.\\n\\nStill, Massachusettshome buyersshouldn’t be caught off guard by property tax increases, which can add even more financial stress to homeownership.\\n\\n“Over time, property taxes have inched up, but I think it’s really about how the counties and the state manage their financials,” saidEllen Steinfeld, senior executive vice president of consumer lending and payments at Berkshire Bank.\\n\\nProperty taxes are what homeowners pay to their city or town based on the assessed value of their home and the municipal tax rate. This tax rate varies by community and largely depends on a municipality’s financial status and spending levels.\\n\\nIf you average these tax rates,the effective property tax rateacross Massachusetts is 1.14 percent on every assessed dollar — making Massachusetts the 18th highest of any US state and the District of Columbia, according toRocket Mortgage.\\n\\nNew Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the country. Illinois, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut round out the top five, respectively.\\n\\nPlus,a study the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership and the Donahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, released Monday ranked the state 46th (from strongest to weakest) in the nation when it comes to state and local tax collections per capita as a competitive weakness.\\nMore Fall House HuntThe fix is in. Shoppers flock to buy homes that need work.All the world’s a stage, so make your home its starThe median home price in Mass. in July was $650k. Here’s what that gets you now.\\nRates can vary significantly within the state itself.\\n\\nAlmost one-third of Massachusetts municipalities have split property tax rates between commercial and residential dwellings, according to thePioneer Institute of Public Policy Research, a maneuver some states use to offset the high cost of housing with a reduced tax burden. This often means municipalities with higher commercial bases can have lower residential taxes.\\n\\nBucolic Wendell — with a municipal property tax rate of $22.15 per $1,000 of assessed value — had the highest rates in the state in fiscal 2024, according to theMassachusetts Department of Revenue. Chilmark on Martha’s Vineyard — at $2.12 per $1,000 of assessed value — has the lowest. Some communities like Boston also offer a residential tax exemption that “reduces your tax bill by excluding a portion of your residential property’s value from taxation. Last fiscal year, the residential exemption will [have] saved qualified Boston homeowners up to $3,610.53 on their tax bill.”\\n\\nCommercial and industrial property owners paid 58 percent of all property taxes in 2022 compared to 42 percent of residential property owners, per the Pioneer Institute report. But there is concern this balance could shift more toward residential property owners amid higher vacancy rates in commercial buildings following the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s a lot that goes into property taxes, but generally, I don’t see higher property taxes as a bad thing,” saidDaryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. “The downside of having property taxes very low is that it makes housing a more appealing financial investment, and then that can crowd out first-time home buyers if investors are buying homes simply because it has favorable taxes.”\\n\\nFurther, it’s important for homeowners to keep tabs on how frequent towns reassess property values to avoid sticker shock.\\n\\n“Some municipalities do their assessments frequently, so the changes aren’t as big,” Fairweather said. “Some will do assessments more sporadically, and then people can get pretty big shocks when they go and see how much their home has been reassessed for.”\\n\\nA reassessment doesn’t have to be the final verdict, however. You can contest an assessment by filing an abatement application with your local tax assessor’s office for potential overvaluation. Further, senior citizens are eligible for property tax credits and exemptions.\\n\\nMassachusetts has a safeguard against municipalities going overboard with hikes: Proposition 2½ prevents a town from raising the rate more than 2.5 percent a year without a majority override vote.\\n\\nThere was an expectation coming out of the pandemic thatoverride votes would increase amid rising inflationand dwindling government relief funds to cover budget shortfalls. That appears to be precisely what happened.\\n\\nProp 2½ override votes are becoming increasingly common: Nearly 100 such votes have taken place in the past 18 months — the most seen in more than a decade, the Globe’s James Vaznisreported in July. About two-thirds of them were successful.\\n\\nPerhaps the nickname “Taxachusetts,” at least when it comes to property tax hikes on the horizon, isn’t such an overstatement after all.\\n\\nSend comments to[email\\xa0protected].\\nAddress newsletterGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\\nGet the latest news on buying, selling, renting, home design, and more.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

       "  'content': 'By Ulrich Lorimer, The Boston Globe\\n\\nThat stubborn, dirt-flecked pile of snow in the shady corner of my garden serves as an unwelcome reminder of the winter season, now only a few weeks from coming to an official end. Sunshine and warmer temperatures this past week have lifted my spirits nearly as much as seeing the first of the blooming snowdrops I planted last year push through the earth. Students of nature will have observed the buds swelling on trees and shrubs, while the bud scales of early blooming willows shyly reveal their silvery, furry flower buds underneath.\\n\\nWe are on the cusp of spring returning to New England. Gardeners recognize the invigorating energy, the drive to return outside that spring awakens within us. Whether you have started seeds in your basement, greenhouse, or kitchen, the excitement is palpable.\\n\\nMy thoughts now turn to bed preparation, clean up of winter debris, and cutbacks of last year’s stems. Here are a few things to consider as you get ready for spring cleanup.\\n\\nLeaving stems standing over winter has loads of benefits, from protecting the crown of the plant, providing habitat and nesting for bees and other wildlife, as well as extending the aesthetic interest of your garden. But now that winter is almost over, when is it safe to cut those stems back? A good rule of thumb is to wait until you observe flying insects in your garden. In our area, that’s usually from late March into early April, depending on the weather trends.\\n\\nFor mulch, I like to leave as much leaf litter in the beds as possible in the fall while collecting leaves from the lawn into a pile. If I have time and motivation, I may run them over with the lawn mower to chop them smaller. That pile of composting leaves is now a great source to top-dress any sections of planting beds blown bare by winter winds. Smaller pieces are easy to work with around the emerging stems, leaves, and blossoms of spring bulbs and perennials.\\n\\nFor some tips on bed preparation, let us turn to a reader question:\\n\\nQ.This spring, I plan to move a 6-foot-long by 3-foot-deep bed of hydrangeas about 4 feet behind their current location. The new location currently is overrun with various wild woodland plants/weeds. The new location is lower than the current bed, and I will fill it with about 3 to 4 feet of new loam. Once transplanted, I will add about 3 inches of mulch.\\n\\nMy question is: Should I use a herbicide to kill current, unwanted undergrowth before filling with new loam? Will using a herbicide create a risk to the transplanted hydrangeas? Will simply adding 4 to 4 feet of new loam on top of existing wild plants stifle any new growth without applying herbicide?\\n\\nKevin,Natick\\n\\nA.The tenets ofintegrated pest management(IPM) teach us to approach pest or weed management in an environmentally sensitive manner. The first step is to observe and learn about your problem. Our reader has identified unwanted plants that may threaten his plans to establish a new bed. Before reaching for the herbicide, let’s consider a few nontoxic solutions that would solve the problem without using chemicals.\\n\\nThe next step in this scenario would be to consider a physical barrier to smother the unwanted plants. Given the amount of loam planned to be added on top, I would put down a layer of cardboard first before the loam is piled on. While the herbicide might not impact the hydrangeas, it will affect the beneficial life found in the loam. Soil is alive with countless organisms that help break down and repackage organic matter into forms that plants can use. Keeping your soil healthy will keep your garden growing abundantly.\\n\\nIf you believe the weeds to be especially tenacious, you can escalate the solution to nontoxic herbicides that use active ingredients like vinegar, citric acid, or botanical oils.Arbico Organicsis a great source for these types of products. Organic herbicides are safe to use around people and pets and will not affect the soil kingdom.\\n\\nAfter exhausting all other alternatives, then and only then, consider turning to chemical herbicides. The IPM approach ensures that we continue to move away from the days of blanket spraying your plants to the use of organic products delivered with very targeted applications using the smallest amount needed. Happy spring, my fellow gardeners, I hope to see you over the garden gate soon!\\n\\nUlrich Lorimer is the director of horticulture at the Native Plant Trust in Framingham.

       "  'content': 'By Madeline Bilis, The Boston Globe\\n\\nHouses in New England are a special breed. Plenty of them are more than 100 years old, while others make the most of narrow floor plans on tiny lots. Historic districts, zoning restrictions, and other guardrails can add layers of red tape while renovating or expanding these homes.\\n\\nTo work around some of these rules, builders and architects have had to get creative — whether that’s carving out additional storage space from some unused corner or transforming an oddly shaped nook into something more useful. Ahead, find three unique home projects that maximize each home’s nooks and crannies.\\n\\n\\nWhen Rajiv Raman set out to convert the garage of his 1870s Somerville home into another bedroom, he knew he might encounter a few challenges. For one, working within the home’s small footprint would be complex, and removing and adding walls was likely to affect other parts of the house.\\n\\nThat was the case in Raman’s small kitchen, which needed to be expanded to connect the garage to the main house. The problem? The only wall offering natural light into the space needed to go. “We knew that we would have to get rid of the bay window in our kitchen, but we didn’t want to just wall it off,” Raman said. “We wanted to create some other source of light in the kitchen.”\\n\\nSo he brainstormed with his architect, Patrick Rettig, to find a unique solution: Building a “skylight nook” as an additional lounge area for his two kids, with rows of windows to let sunlight into the kitchen. Now, this 5½-foot-tall bump-out is a place for the kids to play games, kick back with their Nintendo Switch or iPad, and do homework.\\n\\nSince the three windows on the wall looked directly out to their neighbor’s roof deck, Raman attached window clings to create a frosted effect for privacy. For added customization, he ordered carpet fragments to cover the back of the built-in bench below the nook.\\n\\n\\n“There’s also this company on Amazon where you can just send them exact dimensions of very odd-shaped benches, and they’ll custom make a cushion,” he said, so he plopped the custom cushions on the bench to complete the new dining area created by the nook. The built-in bench and accompanying table freed up precious square footage in the kitchen, too.\\n\\n“Now we have a kitchen you can actually walk around in,” Raman said. “It really opened up the space by Somerville standards.”\\n\\n\\nRenovation projects located in historic districts naturally come with constraints. For his clients who lived in a half-Cape in Provincetown, Chris Brown, principal and founder ofb Architecture studio, knew the challenge was optimizing the home’s original footprint without expanding it.\\n\\n\\nThe first floor, in particular, was in desperate need of creative storage solutions. To find a place for everyday essentials, Brown modified the home’s central staircase, building full-depth drawers below them for shoes and other mudroom accessories. Two triangular and two rectangular drawers are now equipped with heavy-duty drawer glides, allowing them to hold considerable weight.\\n\\n\\nJust around the corner, the team also built an appliance storage cubby on the remaining underside of the staircase. Each cubby was custom-sized and built to fit both the coffee maker and microwave, effectively preventing them from cluttering the countertops.\\n\\n“And then we still had a little bit of leftover space, and the clients asked ‘What about a small wine fridge?’” Brown said. He devised a way to squeeze an eight- to 12-bottle wine fridge in the remaining nook. Now, Brown reasoned, the clients can enjoy an ideal use of that space.\\n\\n“Maybe half of our projects, sometimes more, are dealing with at least some existing conditions, and certainly zoning and square footage constraints,” he said. “We love doing these types of creative, fun built-ins that let us think a little differently about what that space could be.”\\n\\n\\nWhile expanding their primary bathroom, the owners of a duplex in Charlestown were presented with a small conundrum: They needed to encroach into the floor plan of the adjoining guest bedroom — unevenly.\\n\\n\\n“It became an odd footprint,” explained Dennis Duffy, principal ofDuffy Design Group, since the expanded bathroom left an angular “hole” in the bottom section of the wall.\\n\\nAt the same time, Duffy said the clients were keen to have a place where their guests could relax on their own, either to watch TV or read. The solution then materialized: The extra space could be converted into a “pit” for reading and relaxing, as well as additional sleeping space for visiting children. (Later, a TV was installed in the nook.)\\n\\n“[The clients] loved the solution of the modular ‘pit,’” Duffy said. They enthusiastically agreed to a graphic treatment off the interior wall, featuring strips of wood and offset disk light fixtures.\\n\\nAs for what to relax upon, the team selected a layout with cushions inspired byRoche Bobois’s iconicMah Jong collection, a modular sofa that can be converted into countless different shapes.\\n\\nThe result is a cozy relaxation pit balancing equal parts comfort and style.\\n\\n“Having begun my career in New York City, I’m used to working with small spaces,” Duffy said. “I learned early on to try to find the best functional solutions for spaces like this, as long as it stays on message with the concept and adds functionality.”\\nAddress NewsletterOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.Submit your emailEnter your email addressSign up\\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

       "  'content': 'ByMegan Johnson\\nAnyone who has ever taken a field trip to Salem will recognize the name tied to 252 Essex Street in Beverly, which is currently on the market for $600,000.\\nGiles Corey, a farmer accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials, pleaded “not guilty.” He didn’t believe he’d achieve a fair trial and refused to speak. He was subsequently sentenced to death by pressing\\xa0and became one of the most notable figures from the witch trials with the phrase he repeated as he died: “More weight.” According to legend, that’s what Corey repeatedly said to his executioners as they added more stones on top of him. (He was also written as a character in Arthur Miller’sThe Crucible.)\\nThe four-bed, two-bath property, which was first built in 1675 and underwent a variety of transformations over the years,\\xa0belonged to William Cleaves, who was Corey’s son-in-law.\\nSet on .79 of an acre, the 2,315-square-foot home looks almost plucked out of Corey’s era thanks to everything from the wide-plank pine floors to the well in the basement (don’t worry, it’s on city water now).\\nA few steps up, on the right side of the home, under a small porch, brings you into an 184-square-foot kitchen, the first space built in the home. It features green tile floors, an operational 1930s stove, and a walk-in pantry. There’s also a door to an additional staircase to the second story. Next door is the second dining room, a 222-square-foot space featuring wood floors and a ceiling with beams that resemble logs. The remnants of a chimney stack sit in the corner. A 267-square-foot living room has wide plank floors and a fireplace that should be inspected before use. Two windows overlook the stunning gardens and street. A green door to the right of the fireplace leads to the downstairs bathroom, which features a shower. A door to the left of the fireplace moves into the foyer, home to the main entrance of the home.\\nContinue through to the second dining room, a charming 241-square-foot space with a built-in hutch, beamed ceiling, and easy access to the back patio through a door. The main kitchen, a 169-square-foot space, is next door and has a washer/dryer that’s included in the sale, track lighting overhead, and a door to the other front porch. A French door leads into a pantry, while a thinner French door leads to a mini pantry. Another door leads to the back patio.\\nHead back into the foyer to access the main staircase to the second story, where you’ll find each of the four bedrooms. The top of the staircase is also home to the second full bathroom, which has a tub. A bonus room measuring 239 square feet is a great addition to the second story, and a walk-up attic provides extra storage space.\\nThe home features a fieldstone and dirt basement. There is also a separate 1-car garage that measures 344 square feet, as well as a storage space that measures 121 square feet.\\nThe home’s outdoor spaces are some of its greatest features. The backyard, which is partially protected by conservation restrictions, is filled with trees, giant rocks, and a treehouse. The front yard is home to beautiful gardens, where wisteria hangs, and garden plots outlined by stone are frequently noticed by passersby.\\n“The gardens are something that almost everybody knows,” saysDiantha Phosithanof Engel & Völkers By the Sea, who has thelisting.\\nThe home will need a new roof “pretty much right away.”\\nOur weekly digest on buying, selling, and design, with expert advice and insider neighborhood knowledge.\\n\\n©2025 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

       "  'subhead': 'A year after a landmark settlement called for a disruption in how real estate agents are paid, people say they still feel forced to pay them excessive commissions.',\n",
       "  'content': 'By Debra Kamin, New York Times Service\\n\\nWhen Mike Chambers was ready to sell his house in Boulder, Colorado, last month, he interviewed a handful of real estate agents who promised he could fetch $2.75 million or more if he listed with them.\\n\\nBut the promise would come at a cost: Each agent wanted him to pay a commission of at least 5%, or $137,500.\\n\\nFrustrated that not a single agent was willing to budge on the rate, Chambers, 39, decided to sell his house on his own, and he took to social media with the handle @realtorshateme to chronicle the process. His reels drew 50,000 views or more.\\n\\nWithin days, local agents were making their own social media posts that countered his points — an action Chambers described as an aggressive campaign aimed at preventing him from making a sale on his own.\\n\\nCall it the Realtor recoil.\\n\\nOne year after theNational Association of Realtors agreed, as part of a legal settlement, to change a key rule on real estate commissions — a rule that had long uphelda tradition of commissionsbetween 5% and 6%, little has changed.\\n\\nWhat was hailed as a watershed has so far produced a mere drizzle.\\n\\nSome economists predicted the rule change would upend the business model and bring competition to a long-stilted marketplace, breaking the standard 6% rate — one of the highest rates in the world — and forcing down home prices as a result.\\n\\nThough average commissions appear to be slipping, industry watchdogs say that Realtors and their brokerages have used workarounds and pressure on sellers like Chambers to subvert the settlement. So far, they’re finding success.\\n\\n“The industry understood the threat to 5 or 6% rates right away, so looked for opportunities to discourage negotiation,” said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Policy Center, who has been vocal about the need for greater consumer awareness in the real estate industry.\\n\\nReal estate commissions in the United States have long been baked into a home’s listing price and then paid by the seller to their agent. The agent would then split that payout with the agent who brought a buyer, usually with 2.5% to 3% for each.\\n\\nThe rate of the commission split was communicated on private listing databases available only to agents, called multiple listing services, and in the lawsuit that led to the settlement,a group of home sellers in Missouriargued that the covert sharing of rates led to a lack of transparency about whom, and how much, home sellers were required to pay. They also argued it inflated fees.\\n\\nA jury agreed, and NAR and the brokerages were ordered to pay nearly $2 billion in damages. The settlement came five months later, with the NAR agreement to end the practice of commission-sharing over MLS databases as part of the deal. NAR also agreed to pay$418 million to settle the claims, and some brokerages separately settled for millions of dollars.\\n\\nAfter a six-month reprieve, the NAR rule changebecame official in August 2024. Average commissions dropped from 5.64% to 4.96% in the months that followed, which means a drop in commission of $2,870 on a median-priced home, according to a survey of 1,300 agents conducted by RISMedia, a real estate media company. (Two other studies, conducted by the online brokerage Redfin and the cloud-based real estate accounting firm AccountTech, found commissions have not changed, but those results could be considered biased because both organizations have a stake in the results.)\\n\\n“The system has been in place for 100 years. It’s not going to change overnight,” said Michael Ketchmark, the lawyer who represented the Missouri homeowners. “It’s not like one day we started streaming movies and then Blockbuster video stores were suddenly gone. It was a slow progressive change in technology and that’s what we’re witnessing here.”\\n\\nMany agents say that since the settlement, they’ve felt cornered by buyers and sellers alike to defend their value. Jeremy Larsen, a Realtor in Dallas, said that consumers who decide to navigate the home market without an agent are taking huge risks with their money.\\n\\n“It’s like walking into a courtroom without an attorney. Why would you do that? There’s so many possible things that can go wrong,” he said.\\n\\nOne viral Instagram video, created last month by a Realtor in Fresno, California, with 114,000 followers, shows a man driving down a suburban cul-de-sac and encountering a seller’s agent standing outside a house for sale with a sign that reads “0 percent” — referring to the amount of commissions the sellers were willing to pay any agent who brought a buyer.\\n\\n“Hell, no,” the narrator says.\\n\\nAt the house next door, also for sale, an agent holds a sign that reads “3 percent.” The man pulls over and says he’d like to take a look.\\n\\nThe video may have been a joke, but its message was clear: Many agents, now banned from making offers of commission to each other on private Realtor-only databases, are not adapting to the intent of the settlement. Rather than encouraging buyers to now negotiate rates on their own, they continue to press sellers to offer commissions of 5% 6%, and then discuss commission splits among themselves.\\n\\nThose commission splits are largely happening the old-fashioned way: phone, email and text. In one TikTok video viewed by The New York Times, a real estate coach in Virginia with 60,000 followers, trains her viewers on how to build a landing page for each of her listings that sends automated messages to buyers’ agents informing them of the commission they will receive if they bring a buyer.\\n\\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\\n\\n“It only took a matter of weeks really, for most agents to find a loophole. It’s almost a joke,” said Nick Aufenkamp, a Realtor in Washington who started a coaching business, DIY Homebuyer Academy, after the settlement to help buyers learn how to represent themselves in real estate transactions.\\n\\n“There’s a huge reluctance to see any change in this industry,” Aufenkamp said. He estimates he has coached 30 clients who wanted to represent themselves in a home purchase and ran into a wall.\\n\\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\\n\\nThe National Association of Realtors “is resolutely opposed to any attempt to circumvent the settlement,” said a spokesperson, Troy Green, who added that any attempts from agents to influence buyers’ or sellers’ decisions in order to gain more commission “is unequivocally not something that NAR condones.” The organization has a fact sheet on its website explaining that steering is a violation of their code of ethics.\\n\\nBut Green added that the settlement “expressly allows” agents to communicate offers of commission between each other on venues outside of the MLS databases.\\n\\nAnd there lies the rub, said Doug Miller, a Minnesota lawyer who five years ago brought one of the first lawsuits over inflated commissions to Cohen Milstein, a Chicago law firm.\\n\\n“The NAR settlement solves MLS steering. It did not solve steering,” he said. “Sharing is caring. Unless you’re a Realtor, and then it’s collusion.”\\n\\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\\n\\nSome agents have turned to the legislative process to protect commission sharing. A few months after NAR lost its lawsuit, Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Rosino, a former broker, co-sponsored a bill requiring agents on both sides of a transaction to share their fees in writing. With the support of Oklahoma’s influential Realtor association, that bill passed, and went into effect, in May.\\n\\nThe New York Times interviewed 15 buyers and sellers across the country, from Colorado to Ohio to Arizona and beyond, who said they were blocked out of the market when they tried to negotiate commissions, or navigate transactions without a real estate agent.\\n\\nIn Boulder, Chambers’ home listing caught the eye of a local real estate agent, Lindsay Alfano. Alfano, 25, has been an agent for two years. She said Chambers had promised to pay a buyer’s agent commission, and she told fellow agents at her brokerage, eXp, that she was planning to show the house to her buyers.\\n\\nShe received text messages mocking her and encouraging her to change course. The Times reviewed the messages.\\n\\n“You’re working for free,” one colleague said.\\n\\n“Sell your own listings,” another wrote. “This is embarrassing.”\\n\\nAlfano described her peers’ reaction as eye-opening. “The amount of people that were so scared of this guy having access to what we do was a rude awakening for me,” she said in an interview. “The word is steering. If you’re worried how much you’re going to get paid based on the home that your client loves, you’re doing it for the wrong reasons.”\\n\\nChambers found a buyer in early March and his home is now under contract. He is now focused, he said, on building a new company that he says “will disrupt the real estate industry.”\\n\\n“I wanted to pay someone for their services, of course, but I don’t want to just light money on fire because there’s a system that’s forcing me to,” he said.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared inThe New York Times.\\n\\nBe civil.

       "  'content': 'By Mark Philben, The Boston Globe\\n\\nQ.Our next door neighbors recently installed a Mitsubishi heat pump system. We love the idea of heat pumps and have strongly considered installing one ourselves. However, our sleep at night and peace during the day have been destroyed ever since they started using their heat pump. Our house is getting hit with heavy, low frequency sound/vibrations. It sounds like a train or giant truck idling beside one’s ear and sometimes the sound waves seem to harmonize to such a point that a long, almost groaning, vibratory pulse is heard and felt. The owners themselves do not seem to be effected, but the three fan/compressor units all face our house directly and everything is built on rock here. We suspect that the sound and vibrations are being transferred through the rock and resonating with our own home construction materials. Certain weather and atmospheric conditions seem to amplify and significantly worsen the sound. Have you heard of or experienced this issue and, if so, do you have any suggestions?\\n\\n—\\xa0MICHELLE\\n\\nA.This is a tough one. There are a lot of opinions out there given that conditions vary from installation to installation. We have not encountered this problem yet. A few suggestions:\\n\\nSince many low-frequency noises are associated with vibrations, the easiest first pass would be to ask your neighbors to place vibration-dampening pads under the unit. That could help somewhat.\\n\\nOur HVAC company said that it is possible to have the fan blades changed to a more aerodynamic model/material. This is the most likely culprit, but is likely to be a costly fix.\\n\\nAnother option is to have a roof built over the units. We have done that before in certain instances, given that these heat pumps need to be kept clear of snow in the winter to operate properly. Your neighbors could insulate the roof frame with sound-deadening insulation like rock wool. If so, this could mitigate some of the low-frequency noise.\\n\\nQ.We have a wood stove inserted into our fireplace. We were told to have our chimney cleaned every four cords of wood. That is very different from your advice (How often should you have your chimney swept?, Jan. 19). Also my husband was diagnosed with a pulmonary disorder, so we are being more conscious of particulates in the air that would irritate his lungs. What are your thoughts on both of these?\\n\\n— SARAH\\n\\nA.I would not advise waiting until you burn four full cords of wood to clean your chimney. Especially if there is some soft woods like pine or spruce mixed in with your hardwoods. Soft woods leave far more creosote buildup than hardwoods like oak and maple. One of the reasons we suggest yearly cleaning for people who burn wood regularly is because it gets a professional’s eye on your whole chimney. They clean it, inspect for animal infiltration, check the masonry, etc. It’s like having a quality mechanic regularly looking under the hood of your car.\\n\\nGiven that a family member has pulmonary concerns, I think you should be extra vigilant. The smoke from wood-burning fires is particularly hazardous if not contained. It may seem natural and nontoxic, but the particulates emitted can get deep into the lungs.\\n\\nSomething to consider is an exhaust fan at the top of the chimney that mechanically draws the smoke up through the flue. We have used them when we were worried about how well a chimney would draft. Another less expensive option would be to have an air cleaner in the room taking care of any smoke that may escape from the smoke chamber.\\n\\nMark Philben is the project development manager atCharlie Allen Renovationsin Cambridge.

       "  'content': 'ByBeth Treffeisen\\nWant to park in the heart of Beacon Hill? It’ll cost you — $750,000, to be exact.\\nA coveted spot in the Brimmer Street Garage is now up for sale, offering a rare chance to own a piece of prime city real estate.\\n“It’s a pure luxury purchase,” said Rene Rodriguez, the senior vice president of Cabot and Company, the listing agency. “It’s not for everybody. It’s not like everyone can go shopping at Hermes or take private jet travel.”\\n“But I get it though, because it is outrageous to a certain extent,” Rodriguez continued. “But, if you have the money to do it, it’s very convenient.”\\nLast year, thegarage had three to four transfers, with the highest-priced spot selling for around $565,000. However, several transfers were for only $1 because they were tacked onto a house sale, making it difficult to determine their market value.\\nOften, owners sell the spaces privately, so when they do go to market, “they always create a splash,” said Rodriguez.\\nRodriguez said that private transactions sometimes leave money on the table. In this case, the sellers of the parking spot decided to see what they could get on the market.\\nMany of the homes on Beacon Hill lack parking spaces, leaving residents with few options for covered, off-street parking, creating a competitive market.\\nThe price of parking at the Brimmer Street garage has consistently increased year over year. Rodriguez said the spots first came on the market in the 1970s, and they were going for $7,500 per spot.\\n“But a lot has changed since then,” Rodriguez said.\\nHousing prices have also dramatically increased, with many places going for millions — often without parking.\\nRodriguez noted that at those costs, what’s another $750,000 for the convenience of having a parking spot? Plus, it would increase the home’s resale value.\\nThe buyer does get some perks. In addition to being a place to park a car, the parking is all valet, it has a filling and charging station, and attended staff can wash the car.\\nBut there are ongoing costs beyond buying the deeded spot itself. HOA fees apply, and because the spots are categorized as individual condominiums, they incur additional taxes. Altogether, Rodriguez said it’s about $900 a month.\\nBut if you’re not lucky enough to snag a spot at the Brimmer Street Garage, there are the LAZ Charles Street Garage and the Boston Common garages nearby. But both are public, with no valet, and you’ve got to compete with other drivers for limited spaces.\\nOr, one can look for street parking.\\nEither way, “the Brimmer Street garage is in a better location,” said Rodriguez. “It’s a much more exclusive, private parking situation.”\\nBeth Treffeisen is a general assignment reporter for Boston.com, focusing on local news, crime, and business in the New England region.\\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\\n\\nBe civil.

       "  'subhead': 'The Emerald Necklace Conservancy is making few friends with its legal challenge to White Stadium. But it says it’s worth it to defend Franklin Park.',\n",
       "  'content': 'They prune and plant trees as the nonprofit steward of 1,100 acres from the Back Bay Fens to Franklin Park. They run a visitors center, educate people about Boston’s renowned Emerald Necklace of parks, and raise millions of dollars from society ladies in elaborate hats through their annual “Party in the Park.”But this week the Emerald Necklace Conservancy is becoming known for something else: The take-no-prisoners move of suing Mayor Michelle Wu to stop the city of Boston from redeveloping Franklin Park’s White Stadium for a professional women’s soccer team and Boston Public Schools.The conservancy alleges that the city’s plan for White Stadium amounts to privatization of public land and violates the terms of the George Robert White Fund, which paid to build the stadium in 1949. The city and the soccer team dispute those claims, and so far two judges have ruled in their favor, including one that has allowed demolition to proceed ahead of the start of the trial on Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. That case could determine the fate of the $200 million White Stadium project.Related: On eve of White Stadium legal battle, judge’s ruling deals significant blow to plaintiffs’ hopes of stopping projectAdvertisementThe conservancy’s legal campaign has confounded many in Boston’s civic and nonprofit worlds. Since its founding nearly three decades ago, the group has worked closely with City Hall to maintain parkland, a partnership that allows the nonprofit to use the city-owned James Michael Curley mansion on the Jamaicaway as its headquarters for $1 a year. Now they’re at war.“I just feel the conservancy has lost its way,” said Julie Crockford, who served as its president from 2007 to 2015 and notes the organization “can’t mow a blade of grass” without the city’s permission. “I don’t understand the attitude over the fight. ... I think the voice of cooperation and behind-the-scenes negotiation would have been a stronger hand.”Demolition is underway in preparation for a $200 million redevelopment of White Stadium in Franklin Park.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeThat’s typically how nonprofit parks organizations operate. They don’t always see eye to eye with City Hall and may even find themselves on the opposite sides of an issue, but to sue represents an “extreme choice” that risks irreparable damage to the relationship, said Liz Vizza, who recently retired as the longtime president of the Friends of the Public Garden.AdvertisementIn 2016, Vizza was locked in a similarly fierce battle with the city and then-Mayor Marty Walsh over a plan to change state law to allow a proposed skyscraper at the city-owned Winthrop Square Garage, which would cast shadows across Boston Common and the Public Garden.Related: White Stadium project opponents pitch a scaled-down, cheaper alternativeIn that instance, Friends of the Public Garden did not choose to sue but rather duked it out in the court of public opinion. And even though Walsh got his way — today the 691-foot Winthrop Center by Millennium Partners soars over the Financial District — Vizza still believes it was the right decision. (Walsh set aside millions of dollars from the sale of the Winthrop garage to invest in the Common and Franklin Park.)“We knew that if we sued the city ... it would take a generation or more to reestablish a relationship that is vital to working on behalf of these parks,” Vizza said. “Suing would be an extreme choice that we didn’t make because it would have wrecked the relationship.”Leaders of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, which has never before sued the city, say they did not make this decision lightly, but they felt it was necessary.“We see this as part of our mission in a way to protect the park,” said Ben Taylor, the conservancy’s longtime chairman and a former publisher of The Boston Globe whose family owned the newspaper for more than a century. “Building a professional soccer stadium in Franklin Park is not protecting the park.”Related: White Stadium project cost has doubled from previous estimates, with city on hook for $91 millionThe conservancy was founded in 1998, conceived to help prevent the kind of flooding of the Muddy River that devastated Kenmore Square in the late 1990s. Since then, it has grown in both staff and scope, helping care for more than 7,000 trees, picking up trash in the parks, sponsoring concerts and artwork, and advocating for parks funding at both the city and state levels. AdvertisementWhile Franklin Park Coalition, a different nonprofit that advocates for Franklin Park and works closely with the conservancy, negotiated with the city for months over concessions for White Stadium, the conservancy seemed intent on throwing up roadblocks, said coalition president Rickie Thompson.The city-owned James Michael Curley House in Jamaica Plain is the headquarters of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeHis coalition had concerns over game-day parking and stadium maintenance but hashed things out with the city and ultimately decided to support the project by the time the city signed a lease with the soccer team in December. (Linda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, has been part of the investor group behind the soccer team but announced last month she is withdrawing from it).With the team aiming to play in 2026, Thompson saw the conservancy’s litigation strategy as a delay tactic tantamount to “killing the project” and says Boston student-athletes will be the losers.“It would be fine to slow it down if you had all the time in the world,” Thompson said. “I ran track in high school in White Stadium over 50 years ago, and that stadium has been deteriorating ever since. So we’ve been waiting for 50 years. How much do you want to slow it down? 100 years?”The first whiff of legal trouble came in January 2024, when the conservancy sent a five-page comment letter to the Boston Landmarks Commission as part of the project review process. The letter, as one City Hall aide put it, “was written by a lawyer.”AdvertisementCity officials immediately convened a series of meetings with Taylor and conservancy president Karen Mauney-Brodek. There was even a sit down with Wu in her fifth-floor office. The city only learned it was being sued when Globe columnist Adrian Walker called for comment a few weeks later, in February 2024.“I was shocked,” Wu said.Rickie Thompson, president of the Franklin Park Coalition, photographed in 2022.Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffBut looking back, the mayor remembers that meeting in her office with conservancy leaders, and feeling like, even at that early stage, the group didn’t want to engage about solutions to their stated concerns.“It just felt like they were meeting to check a box,” she said. “We were trying to work through all of the different concerns that they might have, and I was really in listening mode at that point. The project was very much a concept.”Wu said she has found the conservancy’s stance “incredibly disappointing” and that “we have not and still are not all at the table together.”One of the driving forces behind the lawsuit is Mauney-Brodek, who has been president of the conservancy since 2016 after working in the parks departments in San Francisco and New York City.Related: BOS Nation doesn’t want to feel like ‘the baby sister.’ That’s why the team won’t play with the men in Everett. | Shirley LeungWe met up Friday, walking the perimeter of White Stadium as bulldozers whirred and beeped while prepping the grounds for construction. She showed me the young oak trees the conservancy planted nearby and defended the group’s legal action.“This is not something just to sit back and watch,” Mauney-Brodek said. “We repeatedly spoke with the Parks Department, wrote letters, met with them, reached out, attempted to find other resolutions. The city had no other ways to go forward.”AdvertisementAnd if anyone feels blindsided, she said, it is the conservancy. When the city, conservancy, and other stakeholders worked on a Franklin Park Action Plan in 2022, the idea of a professional soccer stadium never came up.So far the law has been on the city’s side. Still, Mauney-Brodek is hoping to prevail at the trial.“This is about the park, and this is about these protections that matter for the city of Boston, for this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and all of the parks they’re in,” she said. “This is public land, and that’s the fundamental question here.”On Tuesday, a judge will begin the process of determining who is right and who is wrong. The lawsuit should be resolved in a week or two. But the divide this case has opened between the city and a parks group could last a lot longer than that.Demolition is underway at White Stadium even as a trial begins Tuesday on a lawsuit challenging the project.Brett Phelps for The Boston GlobeShirley Leung is a Business columnist.

Replacing your door completely can run you anywhere from $500 to $4,500, depending on door style, hardware, and how difficult or easy the installation is.\\nThere are, of course, different types of doors that range in price. A composite door is the most expensive. Then there are wood doors — which, keep in mind would need to be repainted every few years to avoid rotting.\\nThere’s also the uPVC option which is the least expensive door type.\\nDon’t forget, there is also the budget-friendly option of simply throwing some paint onto your door and calling it a day.\\nRegardless of which route you choose, keep in mind that it’s still an investment you’ll be making.

His father funded High Point State Park and helped birth Fox Film, while his grandfather launched Prudential Insurance and served as a US senator.\\nKuser, a Princeton grad, made his own mark pushing the eastern goldfinch as New Jersey’s state bird in 1935 — a win that had senators mocking with fake chirps, per The Ridgewood News.\\nAshley Christus of Turpin Real Estate holds the listing.\\n“Denbrooke is a timeless gem,” Christus said. “Over the years, it has been the cherished backdrop for family weddings, graduation parties and intimate gatherings alike.”\\nSet on 6.6 acres, the home, in Somerset Hills, has been professionally landscaped to include a deer fence, mature specimen trees, expansive level lawns, a perennial garden and an oval swimming pool, the listing notes. Three finished levels house the bedrooms, seven full baths and three powder rooms.\\nBut behind the mansion’s grand doors, Astor’s life was crumbling.\\nMarried at 17, she later revealed in her memoir “Footprints” about a marriage riddled with booze, alleged affairs and abuse that left her crying herself to sleep.\\nAstor toughed it out long enough to oversee a glam overhaul by A-list architect Albert Musgrave Hyde, but by 1930, she was done — grabbing their son Anthony and filing for divorce in a split that exploded across headlines nationwide.\\nKuser’s political career tanked after losing a reelection bid in 1935, and he faded into obscurity, dying in 1964.\\nAstor, however, bounced back, marrying Vincent Astor, inheriting a fortune, and becoming a philanthropy juggernaut, earning a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998 before passing away at 105 in 2007.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

       "  'content': 'As the saying goes, a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money — and real estate.\\nMore than 13% of the country’s real estate assets are owned by the wealthiest 1% of Americans —\\xa0a circumstance that significantly enriched the well-heeled over the past two years of sky-high rates and housing shortages. The 1% has been so enriched, a recent Redfin analysis revealed, that their combined wealth could now feasibly purchase almost every home in the nation.\\nThe analysis further concluded that the top 0.1% alone could purchase every single home in the country’s 25 most populated metro areas, from New York City to San Antonio.\\n“It is a striking example of the concentration of wealth in America that the top 1% could hypothetically afford to buy every home in the country — without going into debt — while millions of households struggle to buy or hold onto just one,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s economics research lead, in the report.\\nThis stark disparity comes at a time when an outsized percentage of Americans believe that homeownership is no longer a realistic milestone.\\nTo gain entry into the 1% club, according to the Federal Reserve, a minimum net worth of $11.2 million is required. An estimated 1.3 million American households claim membership, and their combined net worth totals $49.2 trillion. Real estate helps put this gargantuan number into perspective — the combined value of 100 million US homes is $49.7 trillion.\\nIt’s these two eye-popping measures upon which Redfin based its report, using Federal Reserve data and the estimated value of 98 million US properties. While net worth and aggregate home values are not directly related, the Redfin analysis demonstrated how the two measures have pretty much tracked together for the last 20 years.\\nAccording to Redfin, aggregate home values exceeded the 1%’s collective wealth from 2000 until the housing and global financial crisis of 2008. The wealth of the top 1% surpassed home values through the 2010s until a steep drop-off after 2020, when the market disruption of COVID-19 hit the heavily invested portfolios of the rich.\\nBut America’s fat cats have clawed their way back. The richest 0.1% of Americans grew their wealth by $4.4 trillion, or 25%, in just two years, Redfin reported.\\nIf the 0.1% pooled only that $4.4 trillion earned between 2022 and 2024, they could buy every home in the Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Houston metro areas, according to Redfin. Their two-year gains exceed the combined wealth of America’s bottom 50%.\\nAsset growth has long outpaced wage growth, which makes real estate one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Almost half of the bottom 50% of Americans’ net worth is tied up in real estate. And while the assets of the 1% dwarf those of the bottom 50%, the latter group claims the highest total mortgage debt at $3.1 trillion, Redfin reported.\\nThe analysis adds credence to the frustration of everyday Americans, already discouraged by a real estate market in which the median listing price haslong surpassed $400,000. The median age for first-time buyers is 38 —the oldest on record.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

As of this week, it’s $49.95 million.\\nAn Upper East Side stunner, the Woolworth Mansion, just received quite a listing discount — now asking that princely sum, down $9.05 million since it hit the market last November asking $59 million.\\nThis Gilded Age gem at 4 E. 80th St., once the crown jewel of fitness queen Lucille Roberts’ family, is also a far fall from the $90 million they asked back in 2011, when it reigned as New York City’s priciest townhouse listing.\\xa0However, with that ask, the residence exited the market in 2013 and spent more than a decade away from sale, according to StreetEasy.\\nThe Real Dealfirst reportedthe listing.\\nThe new price certainly buys a lot, as StreetEasy notably shows this is Manhattan’s largest residential property currently for sale, weighing in at roughly 20,000 square feet, not to mention 35 feet in width. (Of course, there are commercial offerings — such as condominium buildings — and other investment sales now listed in the portal that are larger in size.)\\nThe discount buzz comes hot on the heels of another posh property,973 Fifth Ave., finally snagging a buyer last month after four years for sale.\\nAdam Modlin of the Modlin Group, the broker who nabbed the buyer for that pending sale, now reps the Woolworth pad. He’s crowing that it’s the “best value” for a place this massive, clocking in at about $2,500 a square foot.\\nLucille Roberts, the force behind a women-only gym empire, and her real estate hotshot hubby Bob bought the place for $6 million in 1995 from the Young Men’s Philanthropic League.\\nThey poured years into sprucing it up before Lucille passed away in 2003.\\nTheir family tried selling it in 2011 for that sky-high $90 million — hoping to smash townhouse sale records — but no dice.\\nTwo years later, they yanked it off the market after a disgruntled ex-employee of Lucille’s gyms allegedly went rogue, splattering white paint and firing BB pellets at the facade in 2012.\\nKevin Roberts, the couple’s son, previously told the Wall Street Journal he bunked there with his dad until 2016. Bob eventually left Manhattan for the Hamptons and Palm Beach, leaving the property to rake in $80,000 a month from a deep-pocketed renter in 2021.\\nThe offering, designed by architect C.P.H. Gilbert in 1915 for retail titan Frank Woolworth’s daughter Helena has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, three kitchens — plus a gym, a library, a sauna and a solarium. Other touches include mosaic tiles, stained glass and a dining room that could host a small army.\\nWoolworth, the “Five-and-Dime” king, originally built it as part of a family compound — two other homes for his kids once stood nearby until their deaths in\\xa01920s. His name is also attached to the Woolworth Building in Manhattan’s Financial District, which once stood as the tallest tower in the world.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

The buyer remains anonymous, hidden behind a shell company — for now.\\nRobert A.M. Stern famously designed the limestone building. But his firm also designed the penthouse, a source said. And the new buyer is hoping that the same team can “refresh” the penthouse to keep it exactly the same, the source added.\\nThe sale comes as Kogan is butting heads with Putin over ownership of the Domodedovo airport.\\nIn January, Russian news outlet\\xa0Vedomosti\\xa0reported that Russian prosecutorsfiled a caseagainst Kogan and Dmitry Kamenshchik, claiming they failed to renationalize the holding company that manages the facility.\\nIt’s not the first time the Russian government tried to take back control of the airport, which was privatized in 1997. In Russia, it’s illegal for foreign entities to control assets deemed to be strategic to national security.\\nWhen it first hit the market for $65 million in 2023, the 15 Central Park West listing included a one-bedroom and a studio in the building. They are now slated to sell separately for less than $5 million, sources said.\\nFor its part, the 40th-floor penthouse is a sprawling 5,398 square feet. It comes with four bedrooms, an elaborate home office that doubles as a screening room and 3½ bathrooms.\\xa0Extravagant details include a giant malachite stone fireplace and large onyx tables, as well as a stained-glass door. There’s also plenty of carved wood, custom floors and high-end finishes — not to mention a chef’s kitchen and dazzling city views.\\nKogan also recently sold his 7-acre Greenwich, Conn., estate for $10.4 million,as Gimme Shelter previously reported.\\nHowever, his palatial pad at the Plaza Hotel — that comes with a castle-like turret — is still on the market. Since February, the\\xa0condo has been asking $23 million — down from the original $50 million ask, as Gimme also noted.\\nAn additional one-bedroom apartment in the Plaza across the hall, No. 1008, is asking under $3 million. The listing broker for both apartments is Compass’s Charlie Attias.\\nThe Kogans also sold a penthouse in Israel for $33 million and a condo at 515 Park Ave. for $14.5 million, which had first listed for $25 million.\\xa0In addition, they have another home in Israel that first listed for $259 million and is now asking a dramatically less $89 million, according to reports.\\nThe listing broker for the 15 Central Park West penthouse, Douglas Elliman’s Adam Rothman, declined to comment.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

The week of April 13 to 19 consistently ranks as the best time for a house to hit the market.\\nThe mid-April timeframe aligns with peak seasonal pricing, increased buyer demand and lower listing competition — a winning combination for any home seller.\\nThe Realtor.com analysis indicated that sellers can make more money in a shorter amount of time if they list during this sunny window of opportunity, compared to the average week.\\nThese fruitful seven days were identified by analyzing average listing performances, measured based on home prices, days on the market, buyer activity and other factors.\\nHomes listed between April 13 to 19 historically reached higher prices than the average week, translating to an estimated $4,800 increase in listing prices.\\nThe findings are bad news for sellers who jumped the gun earlier this year. Mid-April sales achieve 6.7% higher prices compared to the start of the year. Homes sold in January may have lost up to $27,000 in potential earnings, according to Realtor.com. Post-holiday blues and frigid winter weather do no favors for curb appeal.\\nBuyer demand is also more intense during the special spring week. Homes typically get 17.7% more views during April 13 to 19 than the average week. They also sell faster — an average of nine days faster, the report said.\\nSpring sellers will also find that competition loosens up during this golden week, giving their home a chance to stand out. The April 13 to 19 timeframe historically sees 13.2% fewer sellers enter the market, the analysis found.\\nThere is less market competition for 2025 sellers in general. National housing inventories have yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels —\\xa0inventory in January was still down 24.8% compared to pre-pandemic times, according to Realtor.com.\\nBut buyers beware, while mid-April favors the seller, early October is a winning time for buyers. Demand wanes in the fall as families return to school and busy schedules. Realtor.com previously identified the week ofSept. 29 through Oct. 5as the ideal time for buyers to find the best deals.\\nSpring is generally a red-hot time for the broader real estate market as both buyers and sellers unthaw from the winter.\\nWarmer weather and blooming gardens bring greater curb appeal to homes, so sellers shouldn’t wait until after the first bloom to list.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Victorian mansion that doubled as Keira Knightley’s spy lair in Netflix’s buzzy 2024 “Black Doves” thriller series is up for sale in south London’s Crystal Palace, hitting the market with a price tag exceeding $6.48 million.\\nApart from the screen, the residence is located at 7 Tudor Road. The five-bedroom property boasts a custom deVOL kitchen with a massive island and double fridge, a sun-drenched dining nook — and a sitting room with parquet floors, floor-to-ceiling windows and a sleek black fireplace that opens onto a sprawling terrace.\\nThe primary suite comes with an en-suite area and dressing room, while the family bathroom features a walk-in shower and freestanding tub.\\nDownstairs, a basement game room with a billiards table and a cozy mini home theater seals the deal for luxury living.\\nThe current owner, Lisa Thoy, a breast cancer charity volunteer, snagged the place in 2016 while hunting for a family home near Dulwich College for her sons.\\nShe toldThe Times, “I was almost not even going to tell my husband about it because I thought it was too disruptive to our lives and there was no way he was going to agree to it.”\\nBut when Netflix came knocking with a hefty offer to film “Black Doves” there, she reconsidered.\\n“Actually they made it worth our while and I thought, ‘OK, that’s quite a lot of money they’re offering. I’d better at least mention it.’”\\nThe deal paid off — literally.\\nThe property rents for $272 an hour through Peerspace, with a six-hour minimum, though Thoy kept mum on exactly how much Netflix shelled out.\\nDuring filming, the production crew relocated her family to a bare-bones rental, but Thoy and one of her sons couldn’t resist sneaking back to watch their home morph into the Webb family’s base.\\nA bonus perk is when the crew built a shed in the garden — where Paapa Essiedu’s character Elmore Fitch meets his grisly end — and left it behind. Her son now uses it for music and gym gear, freeing up her garden room.\\nThe house’s history adds another layer of charm.\\nHistorian Melanie Backe-Hansen uncovered that it was built for William Morris, a retired surgeon who lived there with two servants until his death at 66. His sisters took over next, followed by a string of residents, including naval captain Halton Stirling Lecky in 1939.\\nOnce surrounded by countryside, the mansion’s views have since been gobbled up by London’s sprawl.\\nListed withMark Breffitof Hamptons Estate Agents, the nearly 6,000-square-foot gem features a gravel terrace with outdoor dining and a grassy lawn framed by plant borders.\\n“With its gated entrance, off-street parking and an expansive south-facing garden, this property offers a rare combination of privacy and space in the city,” Breffit said in a statement.\\n“And for those who appreciate a touch of glamour, the house’s starring role in a popular Netflix show adds an intriguing element to its already impressive pedigree.” Breffit said in statement.\\nBut despite its star turn and her family’s affection, Thoy is ready to downsize now that her kids have flown the nest, adding that her family loved living in the neighborhood — but that the house got too big for just her and her husband.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Art Deco Miami Beach hotel that set the stage for Robin Williams and Nathan Lane’s legendary performances in the 1996 film “The Birdcage” is getting a $1 billion transformation.\\nThe Raleigh Hotel in Miami’s South Beach is also known for its architectural flair and star-studded past. Its cabanas once hosted the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Madonna, but a decade of neglect succeeded by Hurricane Irma in 2017 put an end to the hotel’s heyday.\\nNow, an ambitious remodel is giving the luxurious seaside getaway a second wind as Rosewood The Raleigh,theDaily Mail reported.\\nThe Raleigh Hotel was built in 1940 on the cusp of Miami’s post-war boom. It was heavily featured in the boundary-breaking 1996 box office hit “The Birdcage,” starring Williams and Lane, as well as the recently deceasedGene Hackmanand Hank Azaria.\\nThe film, based on the 1979 farcical French film “La Cage Aux Folles,” follows a gay couple — portrayed by Williams and Lane — whose son is marrying into the family of a conservative senator, played by Hackman.\\nThe hotel was also favored by the late Karl Lagerfeld, who premiered Chanel’s resort line along the Raleigh’s iconic coast-of-arms pool in 2008.\\nThe hotel will once again open its doors to Miami’s rich and famous thanks to the $1 billion overhaul by developer Micahel Shvo, whose SHVO company purchased the down-on-its-luck property with a group of developers in 2019.\\nRenownedarchitect Peter Marinogave the 60-key hotel a refresh, and constructed a 17-story residential tower next door. The Raleigh will be managed by Rosewood Hotels, a luxury hotel and resort company.\\nThe newly constructed glass tower will host 40 coveted waterfront residences. These units range in size from two to five bedrooms and will run you anywhere from $10 to $150 million, the Daily Mail reported.\\nThe luxurious homes boast large terraces, stone flooring and bathrooms with refrigerators just for beauty products. The revamped hotel next door will continue to offer high-end amenities including a full spa, a fitness center and a private beach club.\\nThe Rosewood collaboration marks a second chance at life for the landmarked hotel. The property was previously owned by Tommy Hilfiger’s Hilfiger Hospitality, but the destruction of Hurricane Irma in 2017 closed the hotel in the midst of much-needed repairs.\\nMove-in day for the residences is expected to arrive in late 2027. Shvo told the Daily Mail that “most” of the residences have already sold to cash offers, with a total of $250 million in pre-sales so far.Such a high uptake would be an impressive feat amidFlorida’s softening housing market, which saw a record number of unsold listings in January.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

       "  'subhead': 'Small towns and rural areas become youth magnets',\n",
       "  'content': 'Young adults have beenflocking to small townsand rural areas at the most dramatic pace in decades—and it’s a trend that’s not letting up anytime soon.\\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, internal migration took an unexpected turn withlarge numbers of younger adultsaged 25 to 44 flocking to these areas. And as a result, they’ve been fueling a small-town revival, according to\\xa0Hamilton Lombard, estimates program manager of the Demographics Research Group at the University of Virginia’sWeldon Cooper Center for Public Research.\\nThe 2023 county population estimates released by theU.S. Census Bureauin spring 2024 showed that since 2020, two-thirds of growth in the population occurred in areas with fewer than 1 million residents, or in rural counties.\\nAnd despite many companies mandating a return to the office, the migration of younger adults into these areas accelerated in 2023.\\n“Perhaps the most striking statistic within the 2023 age estimates is the fact that since 2020, the country’s small towns and rural areas have been attracting younger adults at the highest rate in nearly a century,” writes Lombard.\\nThis is in stark contrast to the past decade, where 90% of this growth was concentrated in the largest metro areas with more than 4 million residents.\\nStarting in the late 1970s, young adults pursuing well-paying jobs in white-collar industries started fleeing areas with populations of fewer than 250,000 people in favor ofplaces like\\xa0New York City,\\xa0San Francisco, and\\xa0Washington, DC.\\nBy the 1990s, this large-scale exodus caused a change in the population, where many of these areas failed to gain new residents younger than 45. That continued into the 2010s when migration into larger metros reached its highest point in more than a half-century.\\n“The migration of young adults from rural to urban areas caused communities to become increasingly unbalanced demographically,” writes Lombard.\\nFor example,\\xa0Arlington County, VA,\\xa0across the Potomac River from Washington, DC, which saw its population of young adults grow faster than in any other county within the nation’s 20 largest metros, had six times as many younger residents as those over age 65.\\nMeanwhile, in the more rural\\xa0Highland County, VA,\\xa0along Virginia’s western border, the over-65 population was twice the size of residents aged 25 to 44.\\nAs the 2010s rolled on, Lombard writes that all the census and economic data were pointing to the age divide between rural and urban areas growing ever wider.\\nBut in 2020, just as the U.S., along with the rest of the world, was walloped by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demographic trajectory made an unexpected U-turn.\\nDuring the 2010s, 90% of the growth in the young adult population was concentrated in the nation’s largest metros with over 4 million residents. But since 2020, 75% of the growth in the 25-to-44 demographic has been seen in cities with populations of less than 1 million, or in rural enclaves.\\nLombard stresses, however, that America’s millennials and Gen Z are strategic about which rural areas they choose to decamp to, favoring those regions that have top natural amenities.\\nNatural amenities refer to region-specific characteristics like an area’s climate, landscape, open spaces, and bodies of water, including lakes and oceans, according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture.\\nFor example, Colorado’s remote Chafee County, located in the Rocky Mountains and boasting a high USDA natural amenity score, has seen its younger workforce double compared with the national rate over the past 10 years.\\nMeanwhile, counties in Southern Appalachia’s coal country, which are low on natural amenities, have experienced a dearth of youth migration.\\nDuring the pandemic, when remote working was enforced, the concept of “Zoom towns” became a phenomenon. These remote suburbs and rural areas soon saw an influx of city workers ridding themselves of their cramped apartments and homes in favor of larger and more affordable living.\\nMany companies, includingJ.P. MorganandGoogle, have since reversed their pandemic-era work-from-home policies. But despite that, data analyzed by Lombard shows that many workers have been able to retain what he calls “geographic flexibility.”\\nIn other words, the growth of young adult populations in most rural counties was accompanied by a surge in incomes, suggesting that many were able to hold on to their remote work arrangements in the post-pandemic years.\\nAnd what’s more, economic data suggest that the former city dwellers-turned-rural residents have not just been sitting in Zoom meetings all this time.\\nFrom 2019 to 2023,IRS applicationsto launch new businesses in the smallest metro areas and rural counties shot up 13% faster than in other parts of the U.S.\\nNot surprisingly, remote areas with top natural amenities, such as forests and lakes, experienced the most dramatic increases in new business activity.\\nWhile it is undeniable that COVID-19 and the resulting surge in remote work turbocharged the migration of younger adults, Lombard argues that some crucial demographic trends predated the global calamity.\\nCensus figures indicate that by 2017, rural counties had already started to draw more residents in the 25-to-44 bracket than they were losing. At the same time, the nation’s biggest and priciest metros, among them Los Angeles and New York City, were experiencing an outflow of young professionals.\\n“The booming economy of the late 2010s made moving farther from major job centers more financially feasible,” according to Lombard. “Rising housing prices in large metro areas also made more affordable small towns increasingly attractive.”\\nBased on existing demographic trends, Lombard predicts that in years to come, smaller cities and rural communities, particularly those with “enticing amenities,” will continue to attract younger remote workers seeking greater flexibility.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

From a dragon headed-drain pipe to a rare outdoor terrace, this compact home contains a big personality.\\nThe London listing, which is held by Unique Property Company, jokes that the Kensington flat was “very much an early adopter” of the tiny home trend. The brick facade was built in 1930 and underwent renovations in the 1950s.\\nVisitors are immediately greeted with the kitchen and dining area, which the listing claims has a “Tardis-like feel” thanks to high ceilings.

However, they all went unanswered.\\nAccording toSweeten, a bedroom in New York City must measure 8 feet on either side, have an 8-foot ceiling, and be at least 80 square feet for it to meet legal standards.\\nAnd while some states do make it mandatory for homes to have a closet, New York is not one of them, meaning that Stasko and Gholston’s charming apartment satisfies legal requirements.\\nThis isn’t the first time that New Yorkers have taken to the video-sharing platform to showcase their tiny abodes.\\nPreviously, a woman who pays $3,200 a month for her\\xa0New York City\\xa0studio apartment left the internet in an uproar after revealing that the home’s kitchen is so tiny, it doesn’t have room for an oven.\\nAvery Addisontook toTikTokto showcase one of the most unusual aspects of her\\xa0West Village\\xa0studio apartment after seeing another content creator post a video of her ultra-small bathroom.\\nIn Addison’s video, which amassed more than 1.7 million views, she conceded that the size of the space andlack of basic amenitiesmight seem “crazy,” but she insisted that it doesn’t bother her because she has so many incredible restaurants within walking distance of her home.\\nSpeaking exclusively to\\xa0Realtor.com®, Addison, who works in event production, said she knew that she would have to make compromises and sacrifices to live alone in Manhattan. She lived in the tiny space for a “year.”\\nAnother New Yorker also revealed the brutal realities of budget-friendly city living by showing off one of the bizarrest amenities in her apartment: the “toilet sink.”\\nEmily Bonaniregularly shares glimpses of her day-to-day life in the Big Apple on TikTok, where she has more than 200,000 followers.\\nThough her past videos have proven popular, a clip in which she took viewers through what she describes as the “smallest\\xa0bathroom\\xa0in\\xa0New York City” all but broke the internet, amassing more than 13 million views.\\nIn the video, she revealed that hersink was part of her lavatory. The sink was built into the tank cover in what appears to be a rather drastic space-saving measure.\\nBonani revealed that the water in the faucet is operated by the toilet flush.\\n“What’s great about this is that you don’t have to turn on the sink and turn on the toilet in two separate actions. It actually is the same action,” she quipped as she flushed the toilet to make the sink water flow.\\n“And if you are thinking, ‘What if I want to flush the toilet but I don’t want to turn on the sink?’ Well, that’s not an option. That’s not an option that you have,” she explained.\\nAdvertisement',\n",

       "  'subhead': 'Explore More',\n",
       "  'content': 'This California listing sure “angled” its way into an all-out bidding war.\\nA midcentury-modern home in the Berkeley Hills outside of San Francisco — and one designed by the locally prominent architect John Hans Ostwald — has sold for $1.6 million, marking a breathtaking increase that was more than double the listing’s asking price.\\nWhat’s more, the striking hexagonal residence, which asked $795,000 for sale, only spent two weeks on the market, The Post has learned.\\nListed on Feb. 6, the property went into contract 14 days later, fetching 101% over the list price in a frenzy of buyer interest that saw more than 30 offers, 70 private showings, 300 inquiries and more than 1,000 visitors swarm its open houses.\\nNeedless to say, the home’s explosive demand caught listing agent, Jodi Nishimura of Kai Real Estate, off guard.\\n“We knew that the [midcentury-modern] vibe and hexagon shape of the home would be interesting, but did not expect as many people to be drawn to the home,” she told The Post.\\nThe listing kicked off with a brokers’ tour on Feb. 5, followed by a late-day open house where “people were in awe at the incredible sunset during the twilight hours.”\\nBy the weekend, the Saturday open house burned through 100 brochures in just two and a half hours, while Sunday saw an unrelenting stream of visitors.\\n“One of our open houses counted over 300 people,” Nishimura said.\\nPriced as a “teaser” in a competitive East Bay market, the home’s allure among many prospective buyers stemmed from a perfect storm of factors, with Nishimura citing the ask, its design, its location and market conditions.\\nThis architectural treasure, named the Foley House, was commissioned in 1963 by a dental hygienist who remained its sole owner until her recent passing.\\nSpanning 1,300 square feet, the two-bedroom, two-bathroom residence boasts panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County, all framed by its distinctive geometric design and pristine original features.\\nExposed redwood rafters, refinished oak floors, a copper fireplace, and period details like grass cloth wallpaper and bubble lampshades have been meticulously preserved since its construction more than six decades ago.\\nOstwald, a Berlin-born architect who transitioned from law to design, left his mark on the Bay Area with his Swiss-inspired functional aesthetic. Known for blending homes seamlessly with their natural surroundings, he collaborated with California luminaries like Richard Neutra, while also designing local landmarks such as the Bancroft Center and St. John’s Presbyterian Church.\\n“What dental hygienist can commission a home in Berkeley in this era?” Nishimura quipped, later adding, “It’s a very rare property. There are a bunch of [midcentury] homes in the area but this is one of the most unique.”\\nAnd it was a lure for many.\\nThe buyer pool ranged widely, from “young professionals who are enamored with [midcentury] architecture” to architects and designers of all ages.\\nThe winning bidder, who offered $1.6 million, had a personal connection to Ostwald’s work.\\n“The buyer fell in love with the architect by visiting a friend’s home designed by the same architect, so when this became available they really wanted [it],” Nishimura said.\\nThe Berkeley Hills location didn’t hurt either, with neighbors like Robert Reich, the journalist Michael Pollan, and director Michael Lewis adding a touch of star power to the community.\\nAll this said, and as for the broader market, Nishimura sees a resurgence.\\n“The luxury market in San Francisco is coming back strong. And top neighborhoods in the East Bay are doing very well,” she said. “There continues to be such a dearth of inventory and this is such a desirable place to live that competition remains fierce for the best homes.”\\nAdvertisement',\n",

       "\"As the saying goes, a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money — and real estate.\\xa0\\nMore than 13% of the country’s real estate assets are owned by the wealthiest 1% of Americans —\\xa0a circumstance that significantly enriched the well-heeled over the past two years of sky-high rates and housing shortages. The 1% has been so enriched, a recent Redfin analysis revealed, that their combined wealth could now feasibly purchase almost every home in the nation.\\nThe analysis further concluded that the top 0.1% alone could purchase every single home in the country’s 25 most populated metro areas, from New York City to San Antonio.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nHomeownership is a distant goal for everyday Americans, and a complete boon for the wealthiest. Maria Vitkovska – stock.adobe.com\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nBillionaire and Oracle founder Larry Ellison owns a $1 billion real estate portfolio.  Getty Images\\n\\n“It is a striking example of the concentration of wealth in America that the top 1% could hypothetically afford to buy every home in the country — without going into debt — while millions of households struggle to buy or hold onto just one,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s economics research lead, in the report.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tExplore More\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRussian billionaire sells over-the-top NYC penthouse for $34M — and the new owner wants to keep the gilded and onyx-clad decor intact\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA Hollywood honcho's rustic farmhouse near NYC has listed following an $800K renovation\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA San Francisco-area home with rare architectural pedigree has sold for $1.6M — 101% over its list price\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis stark disparity comes at a time when an outsized percentage of Americans believe that homeownership is no longer a realistic milestone.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nReal estate is one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Andy Dean – stock.adobe.com\\nTo gain entry into the 1% club, according to the Federal Reserve, a minimum net worth of $11.2 million is required. An estimated 1.3 million American households claim membership, and their combined net worth totals $49.2 trillion. Real estate helps put this gargantuan number into perspective — the combined value of 100 million US homes is $49.7 trillion.\\xa0\\nIt’s these two eye-popping measures upon which Redfin based its report, using Federal Reserve data and the estimated value of 98 million US properties. While net worth and aggregate home values are not directly related, the Redfin analysis demonstrated how the two measures have pretty much tracked together for the last 20 years.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n Datawrapper\\nAccording to Redfin, aggregate home values exceeded the 1%’s collective wealth from 2000 until the housing and global financial crisis of 2008. The wealth of the top 1% surpassed home values through the 2010s until a steep drop-off after 2020, when the market disruption of COVID-19 hit the heavily invested portfolios of the rich.\\xa0\\nBut America’s fat cats have clawed their way back. The richest 0.1% of Americans grew their wealth by $4.4 trillion, or 25%, in just two years, Redfin reported.\\nIf the 0.1% pooled only that $4.4 trillion earned between 2022 and 2024, they could buy every home in the Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Houston metro areas, according to Redfin. Their two-year gains exceed the combined wealth of America’s bottom 50%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nJeff Bezos’ property portfolio is worth more than $500 million. Getty Images for Vanity Fair\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe median age for first-time buyers is 38 — the oldest on record. amnaj – stock.adobe.com\\n\\n\\nAsset growth has long outpaced wage growth, which makes real estate one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Almost half of the bottom 50% of Americans’ net worth is tied up in real estate. And while the assets of the 1% dwarf those of the bottom 50%, the latter group claims the highest total mortgage debt at $3.1 trillion, Redfin reported.\\xa0\\nThe analysis adds credence to the frustration of everyday Americans, already discouraged by a real estate market in which the median listing price has long surpassed $400,000. The median age for first-time buyers is 38 — the oldest on record.\""

The 1% has been so enriched, a recent Redfin analysis revealed, that their combined wealth could now feasibly purchase almost every home in the nation.\n",
      "The analysis further concluded that the top 0.1% alone could purchase every single home in the country’s 25 most populated metro areas, from New York City to San Antonio.\n",
      "“It is a striking example of the concentration of wealth in America that the top 1% could hypothetically afford to buy every home in the country — without going into debt — while millions of households struggle to buy or hold onto just one,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s economics research lead, in the report.\n",
      "This stark disparity comes at a time when an outsized percentage of Americans believe that homeownership is no longer a realistic milestone.\n",
      "To gain entry into the 1% club, according to the Federal Reserve, a minimum net worth of $11.2 million is required. An estimated 1.3 million American households claim membership, and their combined net worth totals $49.2 trillion. Real estate helps put this gargantuan number into perspective — the combined value of 100 million US homes is $49.7 trillion.\n",
      "It’s these two eye-popping measures upon which Redfin based its report, using Federal Reserve data and the estimated value of 98 million US properties. While net worth and aggregate home values are not directly related, the Redfin analysis demonstrated how the two measures have pretty much tracked together for the last 20 years.\n",
      "According to Redfin, aggregate home values exceeded the 1%’s collective wealth from 2000 until the housing and global financial crisis of 2008. The wealth of the top 1% surpassed home values through the 2010s until a steep drop-off after 2020, when the market disruption of COVID-19 hit the heavily invested portfolios of the rich.\n",
      "But America’s fat cats have clawed their way back. The richest 0.1% of Americans grew their wealth by $4.4 trillion, or 25%, in just two years, Redfin reported.\n",
      "If the 0.1% pooled only that $4.4 trillion earned between 2022 and 2024, they could buy every home in the Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Houston metro areas, according to Redfin. Their two-year gains exceed the combined wealth of America’s bottom 50%.\n",
      "Asset growth has long outpaced wage growth, which makes real estate one of the most valuable investments a person can make. Almost half of the bottom 50% of Americans’ net worth is tied up in real estate. And while the assets of the 1% dwarf those of the bottom 50%, the latter group claims the highest total mortgage debt at $3.1 trillion, Redfin reported.\n",
      "The analysis adds credence to the frustration of everyday Americans, already discouraged by a real estate market in which the median listing price haslong surpassed $400,000. The median age for first-time buyers is 38 —the oldest on record.\n",
